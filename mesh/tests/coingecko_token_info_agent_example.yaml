input_comparison:
  query: Compare Bitcoin and Ethereum
output_comparison:
  response: 'The agent encountered rate limiting issues and could only retrieve full
    data for Bitcoin. However, here''s a comparison based on available information
    and general knowledge:


    **Bitcoin (BTC):**


    *   **Purpose:** Primarily designed as a decentralized digital currency and store
    of value.

    *   **Market Cap:** $1.7 Trillion (Rank 1)

    *   **Price:** $85,845

    *   **24h Volume:** $38.7 Billion

    *   **Supply:** Limited to 21 million. Circulating supply is currently 19.84 million.

    *   **Technology:** First generation blockchain; focuses on security and decentralization.


    **Ethereum (ETH):**


    *   **Purpose:** A platform for decentralized applications (dApps) and smart contracts.
    While also a cryptocurrency, its main strength lies in its utility.

    *   **Technology:** Second generation blockchain; introduces smart contract functionality.


    **Key Differences and Insights (Based on general knowledge):**


    *   **Functionality:** Bitcoin''s primary use is as digital gold, while Ethereum
    is a platform for a wide range of applications.

    *   **Technology:** Bitcoin uses Proof-of-Work (PoW), consuming significant energy.
    Ethereum has transitioned to Proof-of-Stake (PoS), which is more energy-efficient.

    *   **Use Cases:** Bitcoin is largely for store of value and peer-to-peer payments.
    Ethereum supports DeFi, NFTs, and other dApps.

    *   **Supply:** While Bitcoin has a hard cap, Ethereum''s supply is not strictly
    capped.


    Unfortunately, due to API limitations, I can''t provide current price and market
    cap data for Ethereum at this time. However, the high-level comparison above should
    be helpful.'
