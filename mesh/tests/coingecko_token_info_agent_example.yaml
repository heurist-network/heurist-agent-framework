        between different blockchains. The wrapping of a token happens when the original
        asset is put into a “wrapper” and deployed on a different blockchain. With
        it being wrapped, the cryptocurrency can now be used on a blockchain where
        it previously wasn’t available. One example of a wrapped token would be Wrapped
        Bitcoin (WBTC). It is an ERC-20 version of Bitcoin, which allows it to be
        used on protocols based on Ethereum. Watch this video to learn more about
        Wrapped tokens.

        architecture is different, such that developers have to write applications
        using Rust instead of Solidity or Vyper. However, this may soon change with
        the introduction of the Neon EVM solution on Solana. End user applications
        as of now include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT),
        marketplaces, games, and more. One of its biggest features is its scalability
        in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second. Its
        high throughput capability appeals to high frequency traders, which is spearheaded
        by FTX and Alameda Research. The first use case for DeFi applications on Solana
        is Serum, built by the team behind FTX.

        However, it has since become more popular as a stand-alone blockchain, with
        its own native projects and decentralized applications. Major DeFi protocols
        such as Aave and Curve have also found second homes on Polygon. Unlike Ethereum,
        Polygon operates on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) in which network participants can
        stake the network’s native MATIC tokens to validate transactions and participate
        in voting and other governance decisions. Polygon also hosts its own bridge
        that allows users to transfer assets from Ethereum to Polygon and vice versa.

        receive a portion of the transaction fees generated by their contracts, while
        the remainder is burnt. This creates deflationary pressure on NEAR, making

      market_cap_change_24h: null
      content: Polkadot is a blockchain protocol designed to support multiple purpose-built
        blockchains under one unified network. Polkadot’s infrastructure begins with
        the relay chain, which acts as the central chain. Each chain that runs on
        Polkadot is called a parachain as they run parallel to the main relay chain,
        and is built on top of the relay chain. Besides parachains, projects can participate
        in the Polkadot ecosystem for a shorter fixed period of time through parathreads.
        Blockchains built on top of Polkadot’s own relay chain are also interoperable
        with blockchains that have vastly different technology stacks such as Ethereum
        and Bitcoin through bridges.

        which powers the entire ecosystem. Unlike most blockchains, Terra’s ecosystem
        includes a native algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST). A decentralized
        network with its own decentralized currency is a very attractive thesis for
        both users and developers. More dApps are being built on Terra, especially
        DeFi protocols which are now commonly known as TeFi.
