        content: Wrapped tokens offer a way to circumvent the lack of interoperability
          between different blockchains. The wrapping of a token happens when the
          original asset is put into a “wrapper” and deployed on a different blockchain.
          With it being wrapped, the cryptocurrency can now be used on a blockchain
          where it previously wasn’t available. One example of a wrapped token would
          be Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). It is an ERC-20 version of Bitcoin, which allows
          it to be used on protocols based on Ethereum. Watch this video to learn
          more about Wrapped tokens.

        content: Solana is a general purpose blockchain similar to Ethereum. The underlying
          architecture is different, such that developers have to write applications
          using Rust instead of Solidity or Vyper. However, this may soon change with
          the introduction of the Neon EVM solution on Solana. End user applications
          as of now include decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFT),
          marketplaces, games, and more. One of its biggest features is its scalability
          in which Solana is able to process over 700,000 transactions per second.
          Its high throughput capability appeals to high frequency traders, which
          is spearheaded by FTX and Alameda Research. The first use case for DeFi
          applications on Solana is Serum, built by the team behind FTX.

        content: Polygon, formerly known as Matic, was originally meant to be a Layer-2
          scaling solution for Ethereum to improve transaction throughput and speed.
          However, it has since become more popular as a stand-alone blockchain, with
          its own native projects and decentralized applications. Major DeFi protocols
          such as Aave and Curve have also found second homes on Polygon. Unlike Ethereum,
          Polygon operates on Proof-of-Stake (PoS) in which network participants can
          stake the network’s native MATIC tokens to validate transactions and participate
          in voting and other governance decisions. Polygon also hosts its own bridge
          that allows users to transfer assets from Ethereum to Polygon and vice versa.

          Their mainnet was launched in September 2020 and has since become a major
          hub of activity for DeFi and NFTs. In 2021, they announced their Avalanche
          Rush incentives program to introduce more applications and to promote further
          growth of their ecosystem. The Avalanche chain is centered around 3 main
          blockchains - the P-Chain, X-Chain and C-Chain. The C-Chain is Avalanche’s
          EVM implementation, which hosts various applications and smart contracts.
          Users can access Avalanche through centralized exchanges, the official Avalanche
          bridge or via Celer’s cBridge.

          receive a portion of the transaction fees generated by their contracts,
          while the remainder is burnt. This creates deflationary pressure on NEAR,
          making it more valuable as more transactions are performed.

        content: Polkadot is a blockchain protocol designed to support multiple purpose-built
          blockchains under one unified network. Polkadot’s infrastructure begins
          with the relay chain, which acts as the central chain. Each chain that runs
          on Polkadot is called a parachain as they run parallel to the main relay
          chain, and is built on top of the relay chain. Besides parachains, projects
          can participate in the Polkadot ecosystem for a shorter fixed period of
          time through parathreads. Blockchains built on top of Polkadot’s own relay
          chain are also interoperable with blockchains that have vastly different
          technology stacks such as Ethereum and Bitcoin through bridges.

        content: Terra is a blockchain network that builds on the Tendermint consensus
          (Proof-of-Stake) and the Cosmos SDK toolkit. Terra’s network token is LUNA
          which powers the entire ecosystem. Unlike most blockchains, Terra’s ecosystem
          includes a native algorithmic stablecoin, TerraUSD (UST). A decentralized
          network with its own decentralized currency is a very attractive thesis
          for both users and developers. More dApps are being built on Terra, especially
          DeFi protocols which are now commonly known as TeFi.
