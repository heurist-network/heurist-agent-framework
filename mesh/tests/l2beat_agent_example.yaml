        ### Analysis and Insights:


        *   **Linea Leads with Significant Growth:** Linea shows the most substantial daily TVL growth at an impressive 38.11%,
        pushing its TVL over the $1 billion mark. This indicates a strong surge in user adoption and capital inflow to the
        platform.

        *   **Diverse Growth Across TVL Tiers:** We see growth across rollups with varying TVLs. While Linea is a major player,
        smaller rollups like Ink, INTMAX, Zk.Money v1 (Aztec v1), and Phala are also experiencing significant percentage growth,
        suggesting increasing interest in a broader range of L2 solutions.

        *   **Emerging Projects Gaining Traction:** Projects like INTMAX and Phala, with relatively smaller total TVLs but
        high daily growth percentages, could be early indicators of emerging platforms gaining user trust and adoption.

        *   **Established Players Still Growing:** Even well-established rollups like Arbitrum One (2.72%), Base Chain (5.20%),
        and OP Mainnet (2.41%) are showing positive daily TVL changes, indicating continued confidence and usage.

        *   **Focus on ZK-Rollups:** Several ZK-rollups (Linea, Ink, INTMAX, Katana, Zk.Money v1, Paradex, ZKsync Lite) appear
        in the top growth list, suggesting a growing preference or increasing maturity of ZK-proof technologies.

        *   **Activity vs. TVL Growth:** It''s interesting to note that while Linea has high TVL growth, its daily user operations
        (uops) also increased (7.66%), reinforcing the idea of increased activity driving TVL. Conversely, some projects with
        high TVL growth like INTMAX and Zk.Money v1 have 0 daily uops, which could mean the TVL increase is due to large,
        infrequent deposits or specific events rather than consistent daily user interaction.

        *   **Negative Growth for BOB and Cartesi PRT Honeypot:** BOB and Cartesi PRT Honeypot experienced negative TVL changes.
        For BOB, this might indicate withdrawals or a decrease in new deposits, while Cartesi PRT Honeypot, being a bug bounty,
        might see fluctuating TVL based on rewards and withdrawals.


        **Practical Implications for Users:**


        *   **For users prioritizing high growth and potential future adoption:** Linea, Ink, and other high-growth projects
        could be attractive, but it''s important to consider their stage of development (Linea is Stage 0, Ink is Stage 1)
        and associated risks.

        *   **For users looking for established, yet growing platforms:** Arbitrum One, Base Chain, and OP Mainnet continue
        to be strong contenders with consistent, albeit lower percentage, TVL growth.

        *   **For users interested in specific use cases:** ZKsync Lite and Loopring (both appchains) show good growth, catering
        to specific needs like payments, exchange, and NFTs.


        This analysis provides a snapshot of the most dynamic L2 rollups in terms of TVL growth over the past day, offering
        valuable insights into current market trends and potential areas of interest for users.'

      query: Compare Stage 0 vs Stage 1 rollups. Which ZK rollups offer the best security guarantees currently?
      raw_data_only: false
    output:
      response: "L2Beat categorizes rollups into different stages based on their security features and maturity. These stages\
        \ are crucial for understanding the trust assumptions and the level of decentralization and security a Layer 2 solution\
        \ offers.\n\n### Layer 2 Scaling Data: Rollup Stage Comparison\n\nLet's break down the differences between Stage 0\
        \ and Stage 1 rollups and then identify which ZK rollups currently offer the best security guarantees, based on their\
        \ stage and proof system.\n\n#### Understanding Rollup Stages:\n\n*   **Stage 0:** These rollups are the least mature\
        \ in terms of security. They typically have a centralized operator that can upgrade the system, censor transactions,\
        \ or even steal funds. While they use cryptographic proofs (optimistic or validity), the escape hatches and dispute\
        \ mechanisms are often not fully decentralized or battle-tested. Users must trust the operator to a significant degree.\n\
        *   **Stage 1:** These rollups have made significant progress towards decentralization and enhanced security. Key\
        \ characteristics of Stage 1 rollups include:\n    *   **Permissionless dispute resolution:** Anyone can submit fraud\
        \ proofs (for optimistic rollups) or validity proofs (for ZK rollups) to challenge invalid state transitions.\n  \
        \  *   **Decentralized sequencers (or plans for them):** While some Stage 1 rollups might still have a centralized\
        \ sequencer, there's a clear roadmap and often ongoing efforts to decentralize this component, which is crucial for\
        \ censorship resistance.\n    *   **Established escape hatches:** Users have a clear and reliable way to withdraw\
        \ their funds directly to Ethereum, even if the Layer 2 operator becomes malicious or unresponsive.\n    *   **Transparent\
        \ upgrade mechanisms:** Upgrades are often time-locked or require multi-signature approvals, providing a degree of\
        \ security and preventing immediate malicious changes.\n*   **Stage 2:** These are the most mature and secure rollups,\
        \ aiming for full decentralization across all aspects, including sequencers, proposers, and upgrade mechanisms. They\
        \ offer the highest level of security and censorship resistance, closely mirroring Ethereum's security guarantees.\
        \ (Note: In the provided data, there are very few Stage 2 rollups, indicating the early stage of the ecosystem's maturity).\n\
        \n#### Stage 0 vs. Stage 1 Rollups: Key Differences\n\n| Feature                 | Stage 0 Rollups               \
        \                      | Stage 1 Rollups                                                                         \
        \                           |\n| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- | :-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\
        \ |\n| **Security Maturity**   | Lower. Higher reliance on the centralized operator. | Higher. Significant steps towards\
        \ decentralization and trust minimization.                                         |\n| **Operator Control**    |\
        \ Centralized operator has significant control.       | Operator control is reduced; mechanisms for user protection\
        \ and permissionless operation are in place.             |\n| **Upgradeability**      | Often instant or easily controlled\
        \ by the operator. | Usually time-locked or multi-sig controlled, providing a safety buffer and community oversight.\
        \                    |\n| **Censorship Resistance** | More susceptible to censorship by the operator.     | Less susceptible\
        \ due to permissionless dispute resolution and/or decentralized sequencer roadmaps.               |\n| **Fund Safety**\
        \         | Higher trust in the operator not to steal funds.    | Funds are more secure due to established escape\
        \ hatches and cryptographic guarantees enforceable on L1.         |\n| **Dispute Resolution**  | May be centralized\
        \ or nascent.                      | Permissionless fraud proofs (Optimistic) or validity proofs (ZK) are in place\
        \ and verifiable by anyone.            |\n| **Examples**            | ZKsync Era, Linea, Polygon zkEVM           \

        \ Costs (Past Day Uops)\n\nWhile the provided data gives \"pastDayUops\" (User Operations), it does not directly present\
        \ the average transaction cost in USD. To provide a meaningful cost analysis, one would typically need the average\

        \ measure of activity and not a direct cost in USD per transaction. A higher number indicates more user operations\
        \ on the network.*\n\n### Analysis and Insights:\n\n1.  **Dominance of Optimistic Rollups in TVL and Activity:**\n\
        \    *   Arbitrum One and Base Chain, both Stage 1 Optimistic Rollups, command the vast majority of the Total Value\
        \ Secured (TVL) and show very high user activity (Uops). This indicates a strong market preference and trust in these\
        \ more mature optimistic solutions.\n    *   OP Mainnet, another Stage 1 Optimistic Rollup, also holds a significant\
        \ TVL and activity.\n    *   This suggests that users prioritize the relatively higher security guarantees and battle-tested\
        \ nature of Stage 1 optimistic rollups, even with their longer withdrawal periods.\n\n2.  **ZK Rollup Landscape: Mostly\
        \ Stage 0, but Progressing:**\n    *   Most ZK rollups in the list, such as ZKsync Era, Linea, Polygon zkEVM, Katana,\
        \ and Abstract, are currently classified as Stage 0. This means they still rely on a centralized operator for critical\
        \ functions, or their security mechanisms are not yet fully permissionless and decentralized.\n    *   Despite being\
        \ Stage 0, ZKsync Era and Linea have managed to attract substantial TVL, indicating strong anticipation and interest\
        \ in ZK technology.\n    *   **Starknet and Scroll are notable exceptions as Stage 1 ZK Rollups.** This is a significant\
        \ achievement, as they have implemented more robust security features and moved beyond the initial centralized trust\
        \ assumptions.\n\n3.  **Security Guarantees: Stage 1 ZK Rollups are Key:**\n    *   **For users prioritizing the best\
        \ security guarantees from ZK rollups *currently available*, Stage 1 ZK rollups are the clear choice.**\n    *   Based\
        \ on the provided data, **Starknet** and **Scroll** are the only universal ZK rollups that have achieved Stage 1.\
        \ This means they offer a higher degree of decentralization, permissionless proof verification, and more robust escape\
        \ hatches compared to their Stage 0 counterparts.\n    *   While ZK rollups inherently offer stronger cryptographic\
        \ finality (no fraud proofs needed, only validity proofs), their \"stage\" indicates the maturity of their *overall\
        \ system decentralization and trust minimization*. A Stage 0 ZK rollup, despite its proof system, still carries significant\
        \ operator risk.\n    *   Zk.Money v1 (Aztec v1) is a Stage 2 ZK rollup, but it's an appchain focused on privacy and\
        \ payments, not a universal rollup, and has a much smaller TVL and no recent activity in the provided data.\n\n4.\
        \  **Implications for User Choice:**\n    *   **For users prioritizing high TVL, established ecosystems, and proven\
        \ activity, Stage 1 Optimistic Rollups (Arbitrum, Base, Optimism) are currently the most robust options.** They offer\
        \ good security, albeit with the 7-day withdrawal challenge period.\n    *   **For users who specifically want the\
        \ cryptographic finality of ZK proofs AND a higher degree of decentralization and trust minimization, Stage 1 ZK rollups\
        \ like Starknet and Scroll are the most suitable choices.** These offer a significant security advantage over Stage\
        \ 0 ZK rollups.\n    *   **Users considering Stage 0 ZK rollups (e.g., ZKsync Era, Linea, Polygon zkEVM) should be\
        \ aware of the increased trust assumptions in the centralized operator.** While these projects are actively working\
        \ towards Stage 1 and beyond, they are not yet there. Their high TVL reflects future potential and community excitement\
        \ rather than current full decentralization.\n\n#### Which ZK rollups offer the best security guarantees currently?\n\
        \nBased on the L2Beat staging model and the provided data, **Starknet** and **Scroll** currently offer the best security\
        \ guarantees among the *universal ZK rollups* because they have achieved **Stage 1**.\n\nWhile all ZK rollups leverage\
        \ validity proofs for cryptographic finality, a Stage 1 classification means that Starknet and Scroll have implemented\
        \ more robust mechanisms for permissionless operation, dispute resolution (in the context of proof verification, not\
        \ fraud proofs), and established escape hatches, significantly reducing reliance on a centralized operator compared\
        \ to Stage 0 ZK rollups.\n\n**Zk.Money v1 (Aztec v1)** is also a ZK rollup and is classified as Stage 2, which is\
        \ the highest security stage. However, it is an appchain focused on privacy and payments, not a universal EVM-compatible\
        \ rollup, and has significantly lower TVL and no recent activity, making it a different category for most general\
        \ users.\n\nTherefore, for general-purpose, universal ZK rollup usage with enhanced security, **Starknet and Scroll\
        \ are the leading options currently.**"

        \ | | | | |\n\n*Note: Market Share is an approximation based on the sum of TVL from the provided data.*\n\n**Analysis\
        \ & Insights:**\n\n*   **TVL Dominance**: Arbitrum One and Base Chain significantly dominate the Layer 2 landscape\
        \ in terms of TVL, collectively holding over 72% of the market share among the listed rollups. This indicates strong\
        \ user and developer trust in these platforms.\n*   **Growth Trends**: Linea shows an exceptionally high daily TVL\
        \ change (38.11%), suggesting rapid recent growth and adoption. Katana also exhibits strong growth.\n*   **Optimistic\
        \ vs. ZK Rollups**: Optimistic Rollups (Arbitrum, Base, OP Mainnet) currently command the vast majority of TVL. However,\
        \ ZK Rollups (ZKsync Era, Linea, Starknet) are gaining traction, with Linea showing impressive growth. This suggests\
        \ a growing interest in the finality and security benefits of ZK proofs, even if they are generally in earlier \"\
        Stage 0\" development.\n*   **Security Models**:\n    *   **Optimistic Rollups**: Rely on fraud proofs and a challenge\
        \ period. They are generally simpler to implement and have been adopted earlier, leading to higher TVL.\n    *   **Validity\
        \ Rollups (ZK Rollups)**: Rely on cryptographic proofs (zero-knowledge proofs) for immediate finality on the L1. They\
        \ are more complex to build but offer stronger security guarantees and faster withdrawals. Many are still in earlier\
        \ stages (Stage 0), indicating ongoing development and rollout.\n*   **Stages**:\n    *   **Stage 1**: Indicates a\
        \ higher degree of decentralization and security features, often including a working fraud/validity proof system and\
        \ an escape hatch for users.\n    *   **Stage 0**: Represents an earlier stage of development, where the rollup might\
        \ still have centralized components or lack fully implemented decentralized security features. Many ZK rollups are\
        \ in Stage 0, reflecting their newer and more complex technology.\n*   **Activity (UOPs)**: Base Chain stands out\
        \ with a significantly higher number of user operations (128.28K) in the past day compared to other rollups. This\
        \ suggests high user engagement and transaction volume, which is a key factor in driving down per-transaction costs.\
        \ Arbitrum One and OP Mainnet also show substantial activity. ZK rollups generally have lower UOPs, which could be\
        \ due to their newer status or specific use cases.\n*   **Chain Types**: Most top rollups are \"Universal,\" meaning\
        \ they support general-purpose smart contracts and dApps, similar to Ethereum. A few (like ZKsync Lite, Loopring,\
        \ Kinto, Aztec) are \"Appchain\" types, optimized for specific applications or use cases (e.g., payments, exchange,\
        \ privacy).\n\n### 2. Cost Analysis: Average Transaction Costs per User Operation in USD\n\nThe provided data does\
        \ **not directly contain the average transaction costs in USD**. To perform a robust cost analysis, we would need:\n\
        \n1.  **Average Gas Price (Gwei)** on each L2.\n2.  **Average Gas Used** for common user operations (e.g., token transfer,\
        \ swap, NFT mint).\n3.  **Current ETH Price (USD)**.\n4.  **Cost of L1 Data Submission**: A significant portion of\
        \ L2 transaction costs comes from submitting transaction data to Ethereum L1. This varies based on L1 gas prices and\
        \ the data compression efficiency of each rollup.\n\n**However, we can infer and discuss how these factors would play\
        \ out for users based on the available data and general knowledge of L2s:**\n\n**General Principles for L2 Cost-Effectiveness:**\n\
        \n*   **Batching Efficiency**: Rollups achieve cost savings by batching many L2 transactions into a single L1 transaction.\
        \ The more transactions batched, the lower the amortized L1 cost per L2 transaction.\n*   **Data Compression**: How\
        \ efficiently a rollup compresses transaction data before submitting it to L1 impacts costs. ZK-Rollups often have\
        \ better compression for certain transaction types.\n*   **L1 Gas Prices**: The underlying cost of transacting on\
        \ Ethereum L1 directly influences L2 costs. When L1 is congested, L2 costs rise.\n*   **Transaction Complexity**:\
        \ More complex operations (e.g., complex DeFi swaps) consume more L2 gas than simple transfers.\n\n**Inference from\
        \ Activity (UOPs) and Rollup Type:**\n\nWhile direct cost data is missing, we can make some informed inferences:\n\
        \n*   **High Activity (Base Chain, Arbitrum One)**: Rollups with high daily user operations (like Base Chain with\
        \ 128K uops and Arbitrum One with 36K uops) are likely to offer more cost-effective transactions. This is because\
        \ the fixed cost of submitting data to L1 (which is shared by all transactions in a batch) is amortized over a larger\
        \ number of transactions. Therefore, a user joining a highly active L2 is likely to benefit from lower per-transaction\
        \ fees.\n*   **Optimistic Rollups vs. ZK-Rollups (General Trend)**:\n    *   Historically, **Optimistic Rollups**\
        \ (Arbitrum, Optimism, Base) have generally offered lower transaction costs for basic operations due to their simpler\
        \ proof mechanisms and earlier optimization.\n    *   **ZK-Rollups** (ZKsync Era, Linea, Starknet, Scroll) have faced\
        \ higher proving costs, which can translate to higher transaction fees, especially for complex operations. However,\
        \ ZK technology is rapidly advancing, and proving costs are decreasing. For simple transfers, some ZK-Rollups (e.g.,\
        \ ZKsync Lite historically) have shown very competitive pricing.\n*   **Stage of Development (Stage 0 vs. Stage 1)**:\
        \ Rollups in Stage 0 might still be optimizing their cost structures. As they mature to Stage 1, we often see further\
        \ efficiencies and cost reductions.\n\n**Practical Comparison for Users (Hypothetical based on typical L2 behavior):**\n\
        \n| Factor | Optimistic Rollups (e.g., Arbitrum, Base, OP Mainnet) | ZK-Rollups (e.g., ZKsync Era, Linea, Starknet,\
        \ Scroll) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Typical Cost (Simple Transfer)** | Generally very low (e.g., $0.01 - $0.10) | Low\
        \ to Moderate (e.g., $0.05 - $0.50), improving rapidly |\n| **Typical Cost (Complex DeFi Swap)** | Moderate (e.g.,\
        \ $0.10 - $1.00+) | Moderate to Higher (e.g., $0.20 - $2.00+), depending on complexity and proving costs |\n| **Withdrawal\
        \ Time** | 7-day challenge period (can use bridges for faster, but more expensive, withdrawals) | Near-instant (once\
        \ ZK proof is generated and verified on L1) |\n| **Security Model** | Fraud proofs (assume honest majority, potential\
        \ for delays) | Validity proofs (cryptographically guaranteed, immediate finality) |\n| **Current Adoption (TVL/Activity)**\
        \ | High (Arbitrum, Base lead) | Growing (ZKsync Era, Linea, Starknet gaining) |\n\n**Conclusion on Cost Analysis\
        \ without direct data:**\n\nWhile we cannot provide exact average transaction costs from the given data, the high\
        \ transaction volume on **Base Chain** and **Arbitrum One** strongly suggests they are likely among the most cost-effective\
        \ solutions for users due to better amortization of L1 batching costs. Optimistic rollups, in general, have historically\
        \ been cheaper for most common operations. ZK-rollups are rapidly improving their cost efficiency, but their proving\
        \ costs can still be a factor, especially for more complex transactions.\n\n**To truly compare cost-effectiveness,\
        \ users should:**\n\n1.  **Check current gas fees** directly on the L2Beat website (which usually provides this data)\
        \ or through block explorers for each specific L2 before transacting.\n2.  **Consider the type of transaction** they\
        \ need to perform (simple transfer vs. complex smart contract interaction).\n3.  **Factor in withdrawal times and\
        \ security preferences** alongside cost.\n\nThe provided data is excellent for understanding market share, growth,\
        \ and the general characteristics of L2s, but specific cost comparisons require more granular gas fee data."
