          ### Key Insights and Trends:


          *   **Dominance of Optimistic Rollups in TVL:** **Arbitrum One**, **Base Chain**, and **OP Mainnet** collectively
          hold the vast majority of TVL among rollups, indicating strong user and developer adoption for Optimistic Rollups.

          *   **Base Chain''s High Activity:** **Base Chain** stands out with significantly higher UOPS (111.32) compared
          to other rollups, suggesting high transaction volume and user engagement.

          *   **ZK Rollups Gaining Traction:** While Optimistic Rollups lead in TVL, ZK Rollups like **ZKsync Era**, **Linea**,
          and **Starknet** are securing substantial value and are actively developing.

          *   **Stage 1 vs. Stage 0:** Most top TVL Optimistic Rollups are in Stage 1, indicating a higher level of decentralization
          and security features (e.g., fraud proofs enabled). Many ZK Rollups are still in Stage 0, meaning they have not
          yet fully implemented all their planned security features or decentralization steps.

          *   **Significant UOPS Growth:** **Paradex** shows an impressive 106% increase in UOPS, and **Scroll** also has
          a notable 37.9% increase, indicating growing activity on these platforms. **Space and Time** also shows a massive
          443% increase, though from a very low base.

          *   **Appchain Specialization:** Several rollups are specialized "Appchains" (e.g., ZKsync Lite, Loopring for Exchange/NFTs,
          Kinto for KYC-ed DeFi), catering to specific use cases.

          *   **Data Gaps:** Some projects like Zk.Money v1, INTMAX, ZKBase, and Honeypot PRT do not report daily UOPS, which
          limits a full activity comparison.

          *   **Emerging L3s:** **INTMAX** is noted as an L3 on Scroll, highlighting the evolving multi-layer scaling landscape.


          This data indicates a healthy and competitive rollup ecosystem, with Optimistic Rollups currently leading in TVL
          and activity, while ZK Rollups are steadily growing and maturing. The varying "Stage" classifications are crucial
          for understanding the current security and decentralization status of each project.'

              \ and Insights\n\n1.  **Dominance of Polygon PoS:** **Polygon PoS** stands out significantly with a TVL of **$4.24\
              \ Billion**, dwarfing all other projects in this category. Its high validator count (105) for its Polygon PoS\
              \ DA layer suggests a more decentralized approach compared to many \"Other L2s\" that rely on smaller Data Availability\
              \ Committees (DACs) or lack a DA bridge. Despite being categorized as \"Other\" due to \"No proofs,\" its scale\
              \ is comparable to some top Rollups.\n\n2.  **\"No Proofs\" vs. \"Closed Proofs\":**\n    *   A significant\
              \ number of projects are listed due to \"No proofs\" (e.g., **Polygon PoS, Mantle, Blast, Manta Pacific, Fraxtal,\
              \ Metis, Zircuit, Taiko Alethia, Immutable zkEVM, Fuel Ignition, X Layer, Eclipse, Morph, DeBank Chain, RSS3\
              \ VSL, Cyber, Redstone, K2, LightLink, Soon, Hemi, ZKFair, Shibarium, Funki, B3, Towns, Ham, SuperLumio, Swan\
              \ Chain, Race Network, Epic Chain, Automata, R0ar, Optopia**). This indicates they do not currently provide\
              \ cryptographic proofs for state transitions, relying on other mechanisms for security.\n    *   \"Closed proofs\"\
              \ (e.g., **World Chain, Celo, Soneium, Mode, Lisk, Plume Network, ApeChain, SX Network, Derive, Corn, Soneium,\
              \ Mode, Lisk, Plume Network, ApeChain, SX Network, Derive, Corn, Swellchain, Gravity, Aevo, EDU Chain, Immutable\
              \ X, Morph, zkLink Nova, HashKey Chain, Lumia Prism, Sorare, Orderly, Zora, Reya, Silicon, Boba, Polynomial,\
              \ Sanko, RARI Chain, Lasernet, Mint, Superseed, Ancient8, Xai, Pepe Unchained, Shape, Fluence, Superposition,\
              \ WINR, Degen Chain, PoP Apex, Metal, HYCHAIN, tanX, Ternoa, Everclear Hub, AlienX, PoP Boss, Game7, Pentagon\
              \ Chain, Wirex Pay Chain, OEV Network, Myria, Arena-Z, Appchain, Aleph Zero EVM, XCHAIN, Edgeless, Muster, Molten,\
              \ Deri, SNAXchain, Settlus**) implies that while proofs might exist, they are not publicly verifiable or the\
              \ system is not fully transparent. This is a common characteristic for projects in the \"Other\" category.\n\
              \n3.  **Data Availability (DA) Layer Diversity:**\n    *   **Ethereum (Enshrined):** Many projects, including\
              \ **World Chain, Blast, Metis, Soneium, Mode, Lisk, Zircuit, Metis, Swellchain, Morph, HashKey Chain, Hemi,\
              \ Polynomial, Mint, Superseed, Shape, Metal, HYCHAIN, DeBank Chain, Zora, Boba, Swan Chain, Race Network, Epic\
              \ Chain, SNAXchain, Settlus, R0ar, Optopia, Arena-Z**, rely on Ethereum for data availability, which is generally\
              \ considered the most secure option due to Ethereum's decentralization and liveness guarantees.\n    *   **EigenDA:**\
              \ **Mantle, Celo, Fuel Ignition, Aevo, Soon** utilize EigenDA, an external DA solution. The \"No bridge\" note\
              \ for these indicates a potential risk as there's no direct bridge to Ethereum for DA challenges or data retrieval,\
              \ relying on EigenDA's security model.\n    *   **Celestia:** **Manta Pacific, Plume Network, Derive, Orderly,\
              \ K2, LightLink, B3, Towns, Ham, WINR, RARI Chain, Molten, Form, Eclipse, Syndicate Frame Chain** leverage Celestia,\
              \ another modular DA layer. Some use \"Blobstream\" (e.g., Plume Network, Gravity, WINR, RARI Chain, Molten),\
              \ which is a more direct integration with Ethereum for Celestia data. \"No bridge\" for others implies similar\
              \ risks as EigenDA.\n    *   **DAC (Data Availability Committee):** A significant number of projects, especially\
              \ L3s (e.g., **ApeChain, SX Network, Corn, EDU Chain, Immutable X, Lumia Prism, Sorare, ZKFair, Xai, Pepe Unchained,\
              \ Fluence, Superposition, Degen Chain, PoP Apex, tanX, Ternoa, Everclear Hub, AlienX, PoP Boss, Game7, Pentagon\
              \ Chain, Wirex Pay Chain, OEV Network, Myria, Appchain, Aleph Zero EVM, XCHAIN, Edgeless, Muster, Lasernet,\
              \ Sanko**), rely on DACs. The varying number of DAC members (e.g., 1/1, 1/2, 2/3, 5/7) highlights different\
              \ levels of centralization and trust assumptions. A \"Small DAC\" or \"Low DAC threshold\" indicates a higher\
              \ centralization risk.\n    *   **Other/None:** **Fraxtal** uses its own \"FraxtalDA.\" **Cronos zkEVM, Immutable\
              \ zkEVM, zkLink Nova, Wonder, GRVT** list \"None\" for their DA layer, often with \"No bridge,\" which is a\
              \ significant security concern as data availability is not guaranteed by a robust external system. **Cyber**\
              \ and **Redstone** use \"Alt-DA\" with \"None + DA challenges,\" implying a custom or less standard DA solution.\n\
              \n4.  **Activity (UOPS) vs. TVL:**\n    *   **Polygon PoS** has the highest UOPS (47.70), reflecting its large\
              \ user base and activity, aligning with its high TVL.\n    *   **World Chain** (30.84 UOPS) and **Shibarium**\
              \ (21.66 UOPS) show relatively high activity despite lower TVLs compared to Polygon PoS, suggesting a focus\
              \ on transaction volume or specific use cases.\n    *   Many projects, especially those with lower TVLs, have\
              \ very low UOPS (e.g., <0.01 or 0.00%), indicating minimal daily activity. This is common for newer or less\
              \ adopted chains.\n    *   **Immutable zkEVM** shows a remarkable 101% increase in UOPS, indicating recent growth\
              \ in activity. **PoP Apex** (222%) and **Ternoa** (199%) also show significant UOPS growth, albeit from a lower\
              \ base.\n\n5.  **L3s on Arbitrum One and Base Chain:** Several projects are identified as L3s built on top of\
              \ existing L2s like Arbitrum One (**ApeChain, EDU Chain, Sanko, RARI Chain, Superposition, WINR, PoP Apex, Muster,\
              \ Molten, Deri, Game7, PoP Boss, Xai**) and Base Chain (**Degen Chain, B3, Ham, Frame Chain**). This highlights\
              \ the growing trend of building application-specific chains on top of established L2s, leveraging their security\
              \ and infrastructure. However, many of these L3s still fall into the \"Other\" category due to \"Closed proofs\"\
              \ or \"Small DACs.\"\n\n6.  **Security Concerns (\"Why am I here?\"):** The primary reasons for inclusion in\
              \ the \"Other\" category are \"No proofs,\" \"Closed proofs,\" \"No DA bridge,\" \"Small DAC,\" or \"Low DAC\
              \ threshold.\" These indicate varying degrees of centralization and trust assumptions, where the security model\
              \ is not as robust as a fully decentralized rollup with enshrined data availability and publicly verifiable\
              \ proofs. Investors and users should be aware of these risks when interacting with these chains.\n\nIn summary,\
              \ the \"Other L2s\" category is diverse, ranging from large, active chains like Polygon PoS that are still evolving\
              \ their proof systems, to smaller, more centralized chains and L3s that prioritize specific use cases or faster\
              \ deployment over full decentralization and trustlessness. The reliance on DACs and the absence of DA bridges\
              \ for many projects are critical factors to consider regarding their long-term security and censorship resistance."

              \ others.\n*   **High TVL Growth:** **Onyx** stands out with an impressive **115%** TVL increase in the past\
              \ day, indicating significant recent activity or capital inflow.\n*   **Activity Leaders:**\n    *   **Forta**\
              \ shows the highest UOPS at **2.42**, despite having a TVL of less than $1K, suggesting high transaction volume\
              \ relative to its secured value.\n    *   **Onyx** also demonstrates strong activity with **1.01 UOPS** and\
              \ a **40.4%** increase, correlating with its high TVL growth.\n    *   **Unite** shows notable UOPS growth at\
              \ **53.7%**, reaching **0.33 UOPS**.\n*   **L3 Dominance:** A significant number of these \"Not Reviewed\" projects\
              \ are L3s built on existing L2s, primarily **Arbitrum One** and **Base Chain**. This indicates a trend towards\
              \ specialized application-specific chains leveraging established L2 infrastructure.\n*   **Data Gaps:** Many\

              ### Key Insights and Trends:


              *   **Dominance of Optimistic Rollups in TVL:** **Arbitrum One**, **Base Chain**, and **OP Mainnet** collectively
              hold the vast majority of TVL among rollups, indicating strong user and developer adoption for Optimistic Rollup
              technology.

              *   **Base Chain''s High Activity:** **Base Chain** stands out with significantly higher UOPS (111.32) compared
              to other rollups, suggesting a very active user base and high transaction throughput.

              *   **ZK Rollups Gaining Traction:** While Optimistic Rollups lead in TVL, ZK Rollups like **ZKsync Era**, **Linea**,
              and **Starknet** are securing substantial value and are actively developing, with **Starknet** already at Stage
              1.

              *   **Stage 1 vs. Stage 0:** Most top TVL rollups are at Stage 1, indicating a higher level of security and
              maturity with a functional fraud proof system (for Optimistic) or a fully implemented validity proof system
              (for ZK). Many ZK Rollups are still in Stage 0, meaning their fraud/validity proofs are not yet fully implemented
              or battle-tested.

              *   **Significant TVL Growth:** Many rollups show healthy positive TVL changes over the past day, with **Unichain**
              (25.9%) and **Abstract** (15.0%) showing particularly strong short-term growth.

              *   **Activity Volatility:** While most chains show modest UOPS changes, **Paradex** experienced a remarkable
              106% increase in UOPS, and **Scroll** saw a 37.9% increase, indicating recent spikes in activity. Conversely,
              some chains like ZKsync Lite, Loopring, Kinto, Facet Bluebird, Phala, and LaChain show very low or no UOPS data,
              suggesting minimal daily activity.

              *   **Appchain Specialization:** Several rollups are categorized as "Appchains" and specialize in specific use
              cases like Exchange, NFT, Payments (e.g., ZKsync Lite, Loopring, ZKBase), KYC-ed DeFi (Kinto), or Privacy (Zk.Money
              v1). This highlights the growing trend of purpose-built L2s.

              *   **Emerging L3s:** **INTMAX** is noted as an "L3 on Scroll," showcasing the future direction of scaling solutions
              building on top of existing L2s.

              *   **Data Gaps:** Some projects, particularly smaller ones or those with specific functionalities (like Zk.Money
              v1, INTMAX, ZKBase, Honeypot PRT), lack UOPS data, which might indicate lower general-purpose activity or specific
              transaction types not captured by this metric.'

          \ 5.39% | <1.01 |\n\n### Key Insights and Trends:\n\n*   **Base Chain Dominance:** **Base Chain** is the clear leader\
          \ in current transaction activity among the three, with a Past Day UOPS of **111.32**. This is more than three times\
          \ higher than Arbitrum One and nearly nine times higher than OP Mainnet. Its 30-day transaction count of **276.65M**\
          \ also dwarfs the others, indicating a significantly larger user base or higher frequency of operations.\n*   **Arbitrum\
          \ One's Strong Position:** **Arbitrum One** maintains a robust second position with **35.14 UOPS**. While significantly\
          \ lower than Base, it still represents a substantial amount of activity and continues to be a major player in the\
          \ L2 ecosystem. Its 30-day count of **84.72M** reinforces its established status.\n*   **OP Mainnet's Consistent\
          \ Performance:** **OP Mainnet** processes **12.43 UOPS**, placing it behind both Base and Arbitrum. Its 30-day count\
          \ of **38.50M** shows consistent activity, though it currently trails its counterparts in raw transaction volume.\n\
          *   **Scaling Beyond Ethereum:** All three L2s (Base, Arbitrum, OP Mainnet) are successfully processing more operations\
          \ per second than **Ethereum**'s native **19.82 UOPS**, demonstrating their effectiveness in scaling the network.\n\
          *   **Proximity to Max UOPS:**\n    *   **Base Chain** is operating at approximately **67.8%** of its historical\
          \ maximum UOPS (111.32 / 164.18), suggesting that its current high activity is a sustained trend and not just a\
          \ one-off spike.\n    *   **Arbitrum One** is at about **59.6%** of its max UOPS (35.14 / 58.97).\n    *   **OP\
          \ Mainnet** is at roughly **50.8%** of its max UOPS (12.43 / 24.47).\n    This indicates that while all three have\
          \ room to grow to their peak capacities, Base is currently utilizing a larger portion of its historical maximum\
          \ throughput.\n*   **30-Day Growth:** All three networks show positive growth in their 30-day transaction counts,\
          \ with **Arbitrum One** leading slightly at **8.75%**, followed by **Base Chain** at **4.77%** and **OP Mainnet**\
          \ at **4.58%**. This indicates continued, albeit moderate, expansion of activity across these major rollups.\n*\
          \   **UOPS/TPS Ratio:** All three chains have a UOPS/TPS ratio very close to 1.00, suggesting that their \"operations\"\
          \ broadly align with what is considered a \"transaction\" on Ethereum, or that their internal operation complexity\
          \ per transaction is similar.\n\n### Actionable Insights:\n\n*   **Market Share Shift:** The data clearly indicates\
          \ a significant shift in transaction volume towards **Base Chain**. This could be due to specific applications,\
          \ user incentives, or its integration with Coinbase. Projects looking for the highest current daily throughput should\
          \ consider Base.\n*   **Arbitrum's Resilience:** Despite Base's surge, **Arbitrum One** remains a highly active\
          \ and critical L2, demonstrating its strong network effects and diverse ecosystem. It continues to be a top choice\
          \ for dApps and users seeking a mature and high-volume environment.\n*   **Optimism's Stability:** **OP Mainnet**\
          \ continues to be a stable and reliable L2, albeit with lower raw transaction volume compared to Base and Arbitrum.\
          \ Its consistent performance makes it a viable option, especially for projects aligned with the Optimism Superchain\
          \ vision.\n*   **Future Growth Potential:** While Base has the highest current activity, all three networks still\
          \ have significant capacity to expand their UOPS to their historical maximums, indicating ample room for future\
          \ growth in transaction volume."

              \ Key Insights and Trends:\n\n*   **Dominant Performer:** **Base Chain** stands out significantly with **111.32\
              \ UOPS** in the past day, nearly three times higher than the second-ranked Arbitrum One. It also boasts the\
              \ highest 30-day transaction count at **276.65M**. This indicates strong current user activity and adoption.\n\
              *   **Established Leaders:** **Arbitrum One** and **OP Mainnet** maintain strong positions as leading Rollups,\
              \ consistently processing a high volume of operations. Arbitrum One's past day UOPS of **35.14** and OP Mainnet's\
              \ **12.43** demonstrate their continued relevance.\n*   **Ethereum Baseline:** Ethereum's own UOPS of **19.82**\
              \ serves as a crucial benchmark. Many L2s are successfully scaling beyond Ethereum's native transaction capacity,\
              \ fulfilling their primary purpose.\n*   **High UOPS/TPS Ratio:** **Starknet** is a notable outlier with a UOPS/TPS\
              \ ratio of **2.77**, significantly higher than most other Rollups which are close to 1.00. This suggests that\
              \ Starknet's operations are more complex or involve more internal steps per \"transaction\" compared to other\
              \ chains, or that its UOPS metric is calculated differently. Its peak UOPS of **128.79** also indicates high\
              \ burst capacity.\n*   **Growth in 30-Day Count:**\n    *   **Paradex** shows the highest 30-day growth at **55.1%**,\

              *   **Underperformers/Emerging Projects:** Several projects like **ZKsync Lite**, **Kinto**, **Loopring**, **Facet\
              \ Bluebird**, **LaChain**, and **Phala** show very low or zero past day UOPS, indicating minimal current activity.\
              \ Some of these might be in early stages, have niche use cases, or have seen activity decline.\n*   **Max UOPS\
              \ vs. Current UOPS:** Many Rollups, such as **Starknet** (128.79 max vs. 6.03 current), **Linea** (55.69 max\
              \ vs. 2.55 current), and **ZKsync Era** (62.07 max vs. 0.38 current), have significantly lower current UOPS\
              \ compared to their historical peak. This suggests fluctuating demand or specific events that drove past spikes\
              \ in activity. **Base Chain** and **Ink** are closer to their max UOPS, indicating more consistent high usage.\n\
              \n### Actionable Insights:\n\n*   **For Users Seeking High Throughput:** **Base Chain** is currently the most\
              \ active Rollup by UOPS, making it a strong candidate for applications requiring high transaction volume.\n\
              *   **For Developers Analyzing Efficiency:** The UOPS/TPS ratio for **Starknet** warrants further investigation\

              ## L2 Activity Metrics - Validiums & Optimiums


              Validiums and Optimiums are L2s that, similarly to Rollups, periodically post state commitments to Ethereum
              that are validated by it. However, data is not posted to Ethereum, introducing additional trust assumptions
              external to Ethereum to prevent data withholding attacks.


              ### Activity Overview


              | # | Name | Past Day UOPS | Max UOPS (Date) | 30D Count | 30D Change | UOPS/TPS Ratio |

              |---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

              | — | **Ethereum** | 19.82 | 22.69 (2024 Jan 14) | 50.83M | 5.39% | <1.01 |

              | 1 | **Sophon** | 1.54 | 11.89 (2024 Dec 19) | 4.32M | 19.6% | 1.00 |

              | 2 | **Lens** | 0.25 | 0.97 (2025 Mar 09) | 697.40K | 14.0% | <1.01 |

              | 3 | **Arbitrum Nova** | 0.07 | 54.89 (2024 Mar 05) | 130.01K | 2.13% | <1.01 |


              ### Actionable Insights:


              *   **Sophon** is the clear leader among Validiums & Optimiums in terms of recent activity, with 1.54 UOPS (User
              Operations Per Second) in the past day and a significant 30-day count of 4.32M. Its UOPS/TPS ratio of 1.00 suggests
              efficient processing of user operations relative to transactions.

              *   **Arbitrum Nova** shows a remarkably high historical Max UOPS of 54.89, indicating it has handled very high
              peak loads in the past, despite its current low activity (0.07 UOPS). This suggests potential for much higher
              throughput if demand increases.

              *   **Lens** demonstrates moderate activity with 0.25 UOPS and a 30-day count of 697.40K, showing consistent
              usage.

              *   Compared to **Ethereum**''s 19.82 UOPS, these Validiums and Optimiums currently handle a much smaller fraction
              of the total network activity. However, their purpose is to scale by offloading data from Ethereum, which is
              reflected in their design.

              *   The "UOPS/TPS Ratio" being close to 1.00 or slightly below for all projects indicates that user operations
              are generally aligned with transaction processing, with no significant backlog or over-processing of operations
              relative to actual transactions.'

              ## L2 Activity Metrics - Other L2s


              "Others" are L2s that either lack a working proof system or don''t provide sufficient external Data Availability
              (DA) guarantees (i.e., at least 5 independent attesters, a high enough threshold, or a proper DA bridge). To
              be listed in this category, the L2 must enshrine deposits from L1.

              at 221% and 289% respectively.

              *   **UOPS/TPS Ratio:** Most chains maintain a UOPS/TPS ratio of **1.00** or **<1.01**, suggesting that their
              UOPS (User Operations Per Second) are closely aligned with their Transactions Per Second (TPS), implying efficient
              processing of user-initiated actions. **World Chain** stands out with a higher ratio of **1.70**, and **Derive**
              with **1.42**, and **Metal** with **1.18**, and **Polynomial** with **1.08**, and **Corn** with **1.07**, and
              **Superseed** with **1.02** which could indicate more complex or bundled operations per transaction.

              *   **Max UOPS Spikes:** Several chains, like **Eclipse** (3.46K), **Xai** (140.30), **Polygon PoS** (190.61),
              and **WINR** (69.57), have experienced significant spikes in "Max UOPS" on specific dates, suggesting periods
              of high network demand or specific events driving activity.

              *   **Lower Activity Tail:** A large number of "Other L2s" exhibit very low daily UOPS (below 0.10), with many
              showing "<0.01". This indicates that while there are many projects in this category, only a handful are currently
              experiencing significant user activity.

              *   **Ethereum Baseline:** Ethereum''s activity is provided as a benchmark, with 19.82 UOPS past day. **Polygon
              PoS**, **Molten**, and **World Chain** all surpass Ethereum''s daily UOPS, highlighting their role in offloading
              transaction volume from the mainnet.'

              **Key Observations and Insights:**


              *   **Dominance of L3s:** A significant portion of these "not reviewed" projects are identified as Layer 3s
              (L3s) built on top of existing L2s, primarily **Arbitrum One** and **Base Chain**. This indicates a growing
              trend of specialized applications or sub-chains leveraging the security and scalability of established L2s.

              *   **Activity Leader:** **Forta** leads the "not reviewed" category with 2.42 UOPS (User Operations Per Second)
              in the past day, followed by **Onyx** at 1.01 UOPS.

              *   **Peak Activity vs. Current:** **Onyx** stands out with a remarkably high Max UOPS of 113.01, significantly
              higher than its current activity. This suggests potential for high throughput, but also indicates fluctuating
              usage or specific peak events.

              *   **30-Day Count Volatility:** The "30D Count" column shows the total user operations over the last 30 days,
              with a percentage change. **Onyx** shows a substantial 50.4% increase, and **Prom** also has a high 54.2% increase,
              indicating recent growth. Conversely, many projects show very high percentage increases (e.g., **Skynet** 6450%,
              **OpenZK** 2660%), which are likely due to starting from a very low base, making small absolute increases appear
              as large percentages.

              *   **UOPS/TPS Ratio:** Almost all listed projects have a UOPS/TPS ratio of 1.00 or <1.01, suggesting that each
              user operation generally corresponds to one transaction per second, or that the UOPS metric is closely aligned
              with TPS for these chains. Ethereum, as the base layer, also shows <1.01.

              *   **Low Activity:** A large number of these "not reviewed" projects, especially those ranked 9 onwards, exhibit
              very low or negligible past-day UOPS (<0.01 or 0.00), and some even report "No data." This is common for nascent
              or unreviewed projects that may be in early development, testing, or have not yet gained significant adoption.

              *   **DA Layer Concentration:** For the L3s, **Arbitrum One** is the most popular underlying Data Availability
              (DA) layer, hosting 10 of the 13 identified L3s. **Base Chain** hosts the remaining 3. This highlights the ecosystem
              strength of these major L2s in fostering further scaling solutions.


              **Actionable Insights:**


              *   **Monitoring Growth:** Projects like **Forta** and **Onyx** are worth monitoring for their relatively higher
              activity and potential. The significant 30-day growth in **Onyx** and **Prom** suggests increasing traction.

              *   **L3 Ecosystem Development:** The prevalence of L3s on Arbitrum One and Base Chain indicates that these
              L2s are successfully serving as foundational layers for more specialized applications. This could be a key area
              for future L2 ecosystem growth.

              *   **Early Stage Projects:** The majority of these "not reviewed" projects are in very early stages of activity.
              Investors and users should exercise caution as their long-term viability and security properties are yet to
              be formally assessed by L2Beat.'

          ### Analysis and Insights:


          Based on the provided data, **Ink** is the Layer 2 Rollup with the lowest average transaction cost per L2 user operation,
          at **$0.000062**. This makes it the most cost-effective solution for general user operations, including token swaps,
          among the listed Rollups.


          **Key Observations:**


          *   **Ink** leads by a significant margin, being almost twice as cheap as the next most affordable Rollup, **OP
          Mainnet**.

          *   **OP Mainnet** and **Unichain** also offer remarkably low transaction costs, both under $0.00015 per operation.

          *   The majority of the cost for the top three (Ink, OP Mainnet, Unichain) comes from **Overhead** (fixed costs
          for batching and posting data), followed by **Compute**. Calldata and Blob costs are negligible, indicating efficient
          data handling.

          *   **Base Chain** is notable for its extremely high transaction volume (276.65M L2 User Ops) while maintaining
          a very low cost per operation ($0.000299). This demonstrates excellent scalability and cost-efficiency under heavy
          network usage.

          *   ZK-Rollups like **Starknet**, **Linea**, **Scroll**, and **ZKsync Era** generally have higher "Compute" costs
          compared to Optimistic Rollups due to the computational overhead of generating zero-knowledge proofs.

          *   The minimal "Blobs" cost across most Rollups suggests that the benefits of EIP-4844 (proto-danksharding) for
          cheaper data availability are either not yet fully realized or the data is still predominantly posted as Calldata.


          For users prioritizing the absolute lowest cost for token swaps and similar transactions, **Ink** is the clear frontrunner
          based on these metrics.'

              \ number of L2 user operations (276.65M) while maintaining a very low average cost per operation ($0.000299).\
              \ This demonstrates excellent scalability and cost-effectiveness under heavy load.\n*   **Compute vs. Overhead:**\n\
              \    *   For most cost-efficient Rollups (e.g., Ink, OP Mainnet, Unichain), **Overhead** costs are slightly\
              \ higher than **Compute** costs, suggesting that the fixed costs associated with batching and posting data are\
              \ a significant component of their overall cost structure.\n    *   In contrast, for ZK-Rollups like **Starknet**,\
              \ **Linea**, **Scroll**, **ZKsync Era**, and **Abstract**, **Compute** costs (related to proof generation) are\
              \ generally higher than **Calldata** and **Overhead**, as expected for ZK-proof intensive operations.\n*   **Blobs\
              \ vs. Calldata:** Most Rollups currently show negligible or zero \"Blobs\" cost, indicating that the EIP-4844\
              \ (proto-danksharding) feature for cheaper data availability is either not yet fully utilized or the data is\
              \ still primarily posted as Calldata. Rollups like **Starknet**, **Linea**, **Scroll**, **ZKsync Era**, and\
              \ **Abstract** show some Calldata cost, but it's still a small fraction of the total.\n*   **High-Cost Outliers:**\
              \ **Facet Bluebird**, **LaChain**, and **Phala** exhibit significantly higher costs per L2 user operation, ranging\
              \ from $3.46 to $8.37. This could be due to lower transaction volume, less optimized batching, or different\
              \ underlying architectural choices that lead to higher on-chain footprint per operation. **LaChain** and **Phala**\
              \ also have extremely low user operation counts (1 and 17 respectively), which can skew the average cost per\
              \ operation higher.\n*   **\"No Data\" Projects:** Several projects like Zk.Money v1, Honeypot PRT, Paradex,\
              \ and ZKBase currently show \"No data\" for their on-chain costs, suggesting they might be inactive or not reporting\
              \ these metrics to L2Beat."

              This analysis focuses on the on-chain costs incurred by "Other" L2s for posting transaction data, proofs, and
              state updates to Ethereum. "Others" are defined as L2s lacking a working proof system or sufficient external
              Data Availability (DA) guarantees, but which enshrine deposits from L1. These costs reflect the L2''s operational
              efficiency, not direct user fees.


              ### Key Observations:


              *   **Cost Variation:** There''s a significant range in average cost per L2 user operation, from fractions of
              a cent to several dollars.

              *   **Dominant Cost Components:** For most L2s, "Compute" and "Overhead" are the primary cost drivers, with
              "Calldata" often being negligible or very low. "Blobs" are not applicable for many of these L2s, indicating
              they may not be leveraging EIP-4844 for data posting.

              *   **Activity vs. Cost:** Higher transaction counts do not always correlate with higher per-operation costs,
              suggesting varying levels of batching efficiency and underlying architecture.

              ### Actionable Insights:


              *   **Cost Leaders:** **Fuel Ignition**, **Celo**, **Plume Network**, and **Gravity** demonstrate the lowest
              on-chain costs per user operation, all under $0.00004. This indicates highly efficient data posting and processing
              for these chains.

              *   **High-Volume, Low-Cost:** **Polygon PoS** stands out with the highest L2 user operations count (119.48M)
              while maintaining a relatively low cost of $0.000111 per operation. This suggests strong scalability and cost
              optimization.

              *   **Costliest Operations:** Chains like **SuperLumio**, **R0ar**, and **SNAXchain** exhibit significantly
              higher costs per operation (over $1.00), often with very low transaction counts. This could be due to less optimized
              batching, higher fixed costs per batch, or specific operational models that are not yet scaled.

              *   **Compute vs. Overhead:** For many chains, "Compute" costs are higher than "Overhead," indicating that the
              execution and proof generation on L1 are more expensive than the fixed costs of posting data. However, for some,
              like **World Chain**, **Redstone**, **Blast**, and **Metal**, "Overhead" is a significant or even dominant factor,
              suggesting potential inefficiencies in their batching or data submission mechanisms.

              *   **Blob Adoption:** The "N/A" or "<$0.000001" for "Blobs" across most of these "Other" L2s suggests that
              they are either not yet utilizing EIP-4844 for data availability or their data posting methods do not categorize
              costs in this manner. This is a key area for potential cost reduction if they transition to blob-based data
              posting.

              *   **Emerging Chains:** Projects with very low transaction counts (e.g., **Edgeless**, **Optopia**, **SNAXchain**,
              **R0ar**, **SuperLumio**) often show disproportionately high per-operation costs. This is expected as fixed
              costs are amortized over fewer transactions. As these chains scale, their per-operation costs should ideally
              decrease.

              *   **GRVT:** The "No data" for GRVT indicates it''s either very new, has not processed enough transactions
              to generate meaningful cost data, or its data is not yet integrated into L2Beat''s cost tracking.


              **Recommendation:** For projects in the "Others" category, optimizing batching strategies and exploring the
              adoption of EIP-4844 blobs (if applicable to their architecture) could lead to significant reductions in on-chain
              costs, especially for those with high "Calldata" or "Overhead" components. Further investigation into the specific
              architectures of high-cost, low-volume chains would be necessary to understand their cost structures.'

          No data | No data | **0.00** | 0.00% |\n\n### Key Insights and Trends:\n\n*   **Validiums Lead in TVL for this Category:**
          **ImmutableX** is by far the largest Validium, securing **$1.11B**, primarily focused on NFT and gaming applications.
          This highlights a strong niche for Validiums in sectors where high transaction throughput and lower costs are critical,
          and off-chain data availability is acceptable.\n*   **Niche Applications:** Most Validiums listed are specialized
          "Appchains" for specific use cases like NFT/Gaming (**ImmutableX**, **Myria**, **Sorare**) or Exchanges/Bridges
          (**Rhino.fi**, **ApeX Protocol**).\n*   **Limited Optimium Adoption:** **OMGX** is the only Optimium with reported
          TVL, and it is significantly lower at **$100K**. **Metis Andromeda** is listed as an Optimium but has no reported
          TVL, indicating very limited adoption or ongoing transition for this type of L2.\n*   **Lower Overall Activity:**
          Compared to top Rollups, the UOPS for Validiums and Optimiums are generally very low, often close to zero or no
          data reported. This suggests lower general-purpose transaction volume, with activity concentrated within their specific
          application domains.\n*   **Stage Status:** **ImmutableX** and **Sorare** are in Stage 1, indicating a higher level
          of maturity and security for Validiums, similar to some top Rollups. Many others are in Stage 0, still in early
          development or implementation phases of their security features.\n*   **Data Availability Trade-offs:** The core
          distinction of Validiums and Optimiums is their off-chain data availability. This design choice typically leads
          to lower transaction costs and higher scalability but introduces a different trust assumption compared to Rollups,
          which post all data on-chain. The current TVL numbers suggest that while this model works well for specific applications
          (like gaming), it has not yet achieved the broad adoption of Rollups for general-purpose DeFi or transactions.\n\nIn
          summary, Validiums have found a significant niche in the NFT and gaming space, with **ImmutableX** leading the pack.
          However, their overall TVL and activity are significantly lower than the top Rollups, and Optimiums have seen very
          limited traction so far. This underscores the current market preference for the stricter data availability guarantees
          of Rollups for general-purpose L2 scaling."}}'

          \ leaders in TVL among the \"Not Reviewed\" projects, significantly outpacing others.\n*   **High TVL Growth:**\
          \ **Onyx** stands out with an impressive **115%** TVL increase in the past day, indicating significant recent activity\
          \ or capital inflow.\n*   **Activity Leaders:**\n    *   **Forta** shows the highest UOPS at **2.42**, despite having\
          \ a TVL of less than $1K, suggesting high transaction volume relative to its secured value.\n    *   **Onyx** also\
          \ demonstrates strong activity with **1.01 UOPS** and a **40.4%** increase, correlating with its high TVL growth.\n\
          \    *   **Unite** shows notable UOPS growth at **53.7%**, reaching **0.33 UOPS**.\n*   **L3 Dominance:** A significant\
          \ number of these \"Not Reviewed\" projects are L3s built on existing L2s, primarily **Arbitrum One** and **Base\
          \ Chain**. This indicates a trend towards specialized application-specific chains leveraging established L2 infrastructure.\n\
          *   **Data Gaps:** Many projects, particularly those with lower TVL or newer status, lack UOPS data, making a comprehensive\
          \ activity comparison challenging.\n*   **Rollup vs. Optimium/Validium:** While Optimistic Rollups and ZK Rollups\
          \ hold the top TVL positions, Optimiums are prevalent among the \"Not Reviewed\" L3s, suggesting a preference for\
          \ their data availability and cost characteristics in early-stage or specialized deployments.\n*   **Emerging ZK\
          \ Rollups:** Prom and Rarimo are notable ZK Rollups in this category, indicating the continued exploration and development\
          \ of ZK technology, even in less mature projects.\n*   **Investment Opportunity/Risk:** Projects with high TVL growth\
          \ and activity (e.g., Onyx) might represent emerging opportunities, but their \"Not Reviewed\" status means their\
          \ underlying security and decentralization properties are unverified by L2Beat. Investors should exercise caution\
          \ and conduct thorough due diligence."
