    output:
      response: "The Ethereum wallet `0x2b25b37c683f042e9ae1877bc59a1bb642eb1073`\
        \ has exhibited highly active trading behavior over the past 30 days, indicating\
        \ a consistent engagement in decentralized finance (DeFi) activities.\n\n\
        **Key Metrics and Insights (Last 30 Days):**\n\n*   **Trading Volume:** The\
        \ wallet has generated a substantial total trading volume of **36.8M USD**\
        \ (36,809,796.02 USD) across decentralized exchanges (DEXs).\n    *   The\
        \ average trading volume per swap was 15,254.78 USD, while the median was\
        \ significantly lower at 2,576.23 USD. This suggests a mix of larger, impactful\
        \ trades alongside a higher frequency of smaller transactions.\n*   **Transaction\
        \ Count:**\n    *   A total of **2,413 DEX swap actions** were performed.\n\
        \    *   Overall, the wallet executed **2,431 transactions** on the Ethereum\
        \ network, including swaps and other interactions. This high transaction count\
        \ points to a very active and frequent trading strategy.\n*   **Token Diversity:**\n\
        \    *   The wallet bought **40 unique tokens** and sold **39 unique tokens**.\
        \ This broad range of tokens indicates a diverse trading strategy, potentially\
        \ involving exploring new or trending assets, or actively managing a diversified\
        \ portfolio.\n*   **Profit and Loss (PNL):** The wallet realized a significant\
        \ profit of **460,082.78 USD** (460,082.78 USD) from DEX trading. This substantial\
        \ PNL, coupled with high trading volume and frequency, suggests a successful\
        \ and potentially sophisticated trading approach.\n*   **Gas Fees:**\n   \
        \ *   The total gas fees paid amounted to **2.23 ETH** (2.2299910644092376\
        \ ETH).\n    *   The average gas fee per transaction was 0.000917 ETH, with\
        \ a median of 0.000232 ETH. Given the high transaction count, the total gas\
        \ expenditure is considerable, but the average and median per transaction\
        \ seem to be managed, likely through timing transactions during lower gas\
        \ price periods or by engaging in efficient contract interactions.\n\n**Behavioral\
        \ Patterns Over Time:**\n\n*   **High Frequency and Consistency:** The sheer\
        \ number of transactions (over 2,400 in 30 days) indicates a consistent and\
        \ high-frequency trading pattern. This wallet is not merely holding assets\
        \ but actively engaging in market movements.\n*   **Active Management:** The\
        \ diversity in tokens bought and sold, combined with the high transaction\
        \ count, suggests an active management strategy. This could involve:\n   \
        \ *   **Arbitrage:** Exploiting price differences across various DEXs or token\
        \ pairs.\n    *   **Trend Following:** Rapidly entering and exiting positions\
        \ based on market trends.\n    *   **Yield Farming/Liquidity Provision with\
        \ frequent rebalancing:** While not explicitly stated, the rapid buying and\
        \ selling of diverse tokens could be part of a strategy to optimize returns\
        \ in DeFi protocols.\n*   **Profitability:** The significant positive PNL\
        \ indicates that the wallet's trading strategies have been largely successful\
        \ over the observed period.\n\n**Unusual or Suspicious Activity:**\n\nBased\
        \ solely on the provided data, there is no immediately apparent \"unusual\
        \ or suspicious\" activity. The high volume, frequency, and profitability,\
        \ while remarkable, are consistent with a highly active and potentially professional\
        \ DeFi trader or bot. Without further context on specific token movements\
        \ or interactions with known exploit contracts, it's difficult to flag anything\
        \ as suspicious.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWallet `0x2b25b37c683f042e9ae1877bc59a1bb642eb1073`\
        \ is an extremely active and profitable Ethereum DEX trader. Its behavior\
        \ is characterized by high trading volume, frequent transactions, diverse\
        \ token engagement, and a significant positive PNL. The patterns suggest a\
        \ sophisticated and consistent strategy focused on active market participation\
        \ and profit generation within the DeFi ecosystem."

    output:
      response: "The Base wallet `0x97224Dd2aFB28F6f442E773853F229B3d8A0999a` has\
        \ been highly active over the past 30 days, exhibiting substantial trading\
        \ volume and a diverse range of tokens.\n\n**Key Metrics and Insights (Last\
        \ 30 Days):**\n\n*   **Trading Volume:** The wallet has engaged in a total\
        \ trading volume of **37,591.12 USD**, with an average of **167.07 USD** per\
        \ trade and a median of **64.95 USD**. This indicates frequent, moderately\
        \ sized trades rather than a few large transactions.\n*   **Transaction Count:**\
        \ A total of **429 transactions** were executed on the Base chain, with **225\
        \ DEX swap actions**. This high transaction count points to a very active\
        \ trader.\n*   **Token Diversity:** The wallet bought **20 unique tokens**\
        \ and sold **20 unique tokens** within the 30-day period. This suggests a\
        \ strategy of diversifying holdings and actively managing a portfolio of various\
        \ tokens.\n*   **Profit and Loss (PNL):** The wallet realized a significant\
        \ profit of **3,752.36 USD** from its DEX swaps, indicating successful trading\
        \ strategies.\n*   **Gas Fees:**\n    *   Total gas fees incurred: **0.00052025859614097773\
        \ ETH** (approximately **1.8 USD** at current ETH prices, assuming 1 ETH =\
        \ ~3500 USD).\n    *   Average gas fee per transaction: **0.0000012127240003286194\
        \ ETH** (approximately **0.0042 USD**).\n    *   Median gas fee per transaction:\
        \ **0.000000292335460059 ETH** (approximately **0.001 USD**).\n    These gas\
        \ fees are relatively low, which is typical for the Base network, making frequent\
        \ trading more economically viable.\n\n**Behavioral Patterns Over Time:**\n\
        \nThe high number of transactions (429 total, 225 DEX swaps) and the diversity\
        \ of tokens bought and sold strongly suggest an **active trading strategy**.\
        \ The consistent daily activity, as implied by the high transaction count\
        \ over 30 days, indicates a dedicated trader.\n\n**Trends:**\n\n*   **Active\
        \ Trading:** The wallet is clearly engaged in frequent buying and selling,\
        \ actively managing its token positions.\n*   **Profitability:** The positive\
        \ PNL of 3,752.36 USD indicates a successful trading approach.\n*   **Diversification:**\
        \ Trading 20 unique tokens suggests a strategy of not putting all eggs in\
        \ one basket, potentially spreading risk or seeking opportunities across various\
        \ assets.\n\n**Unusual or Suspicious Activity:**\n\nThere is **no immediately\
        \ apparent unusual or suspicious activity** based on the provided data. The\
        \ metrics align with a highly active and profitable trader on the Base network.\n\
        \n**Missing or Incomplete Data:**\n\nThe provided data covers a 30-day period.\
        \ Longer-term historical data would be beneficial to identify more extensive\
        \ trends in accumulation, selling pressure, or changes in trading strategy\
        \ over several months or years. Details on specific tokens traded, individual\
        \ trade sizes, and the timing of these trades would provide deeper insights\
        \ into the wallet's strategy."
