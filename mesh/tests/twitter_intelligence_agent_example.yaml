          - text: 'A very solid @Polymarket strategy that I’m currently coding. I
              tested it manually and it’s extremely effective already, but it will
              be even more powerful once fully automated in a bot. Everything happens
              on the “Bitcoin Up or Down” 15-minute market. > A YES share pays $1
              if BTC is above its reference price, $0 otherwise. > A NO share pays
              $1 if BTC is below its reference price, $0 otherwise. In a “clean” world,
              prices should satisfy: YES price + NO price ≈ $1.00 But in reality,
              emotions, thin liquidity, and fast price action regularly create moments
              where the sum becomes greater than $1 or lower than $1. The strategy
              consists of buying a “synthetic $1 payout” for less than $1, by accumulating
              YES and NO at different moments when one side is temporarily mispriced.
              If we manage to reach: (Average YES cost) + (Average NO cost) < 1.00
              …then profit is mathematically locked in. YES and NO should not be bought
              at the same time. They must be bought at different moments, when one
              side becomes unusually cheap. And this happens often. Because 15 minutes
              is a very short timeframe, there are rapid emotional swings and frequent
              overreactions to small price moves. The best part is automating this
              with a bot. These are the variables I plan to track: Qty_Y = total YES
              shares owned Qty_N = total NO shares owned Cost_Y = total dollars spent
              on YES Cost_N = total dollars spent on NO From there, we compute: avg_Y
              = Cost_Y / Qty_Y avg_N = Cost_N / Qty_N PairCost = avg_Y + avg_N PairCost
              must stay below 1. To maximize guaranteed payout and reduce execution
              risk, the strategy should keep inventories approximately balanced: Qty_Y
              ≈ Qty_N (±2–5%) Here is the mathematical proof (on paper) showing that
              profit is guaranteed when this condition is met. It’s not just about
              buying YES or NO when it’s cheap, but when it drops abnormally fast.
              Prices usually oscillate around 50/50. If YES suddenly drops to 0.30,
              I buy YES. Then I wait to buy the same amount of NO when NO comes back
              toward 0.50. And I repeat this process. By the end of the 15 minutes,
              it’s absolutely necessary to hold both YES and NO shares in roughly
              equal proportions, otherwise the strategy is not 100% reliable. In a
              15-minute market, the window is very small, you might buy YES cheaply
              but never get the chance to buy NO cheaply before resolution. That’s
              why the bot must include rules such as: > “Stop opening new inventory
              after X minutes” > “Reduce exposure if time left is too short” > “Only
              trade when volatility and liquidity are sufficient” Here’s how it works
              in practice: You start with nothing. Step 1: The market overreacts →
              YES becomes cheap You buy: 1,000 YES at 0.52 → Cost_Y = 520 Now: Qty_Y
              = 1,000, avg_Y = 0.52 Qty_N = 0 You are exposed until you also buy NO.
              Step 2: Later, sentiment flips → NO becomes cheap You buy: 1,000 NO
              at 0.45 → Cost_N = 450 Now: avg_Y = 0.52 avg_N = 0.45 PairCost = 0.97
              Total cost = 970 min(Qty_Y, Qty_N) = 1,000 At settlement, whichever
              side wins pays $1,000. Profit = 1,000 − 970 = $30 (before fees). Let
              me know if you’re interested and I can share the bot once it’s finished.'

              recently reported a strong net inflow, while U.S. Ethereum ETFs continue
              to see capital outflows. • BTC: Robust inflow; AUM remains above $120
              billion. ETF buyers are seizing this dip to increase exposure. • ETH:
              Persistent outflows with considerably smaller AUM. Investors are de-risking
              or quietly rotating away from ETH. Takeaway: Current flows indicate
              a preference for BTC over ETH, suggesting no immediate ETH comeback.'

          - text: 🚨Why $BTC dumps during heavy institutional buying? According to
              @BullTheoryio, forced sellers (⚒️ miners + early holders) are exiting,
              while long-term capital absorbs the supply. The 10 a.m. ET dumps are
              driven by Wall Street opens, flows & algos Once miners and OG holders
              finish selling, the price will stop falling!

          - text: People miss the irony here. Gold isn’t valuable because it’s useful.
              Most of it just sits there, priced on belief, scarcity, and coordination.
              That’s the same mental model people argue against when it comes to crypto.
              What’s interesting is not gold vs bitcoin. It’s that you can now trade
              both narratives side by side, on-chain, with real price discovery. That’s
              where @OrderlyNetwork quietly gets it right.

          - text: STS Digital quoted in Bloomberg - @stsdigital_io Reach out if you
              want to chat options/liquidity. “This cycle may end up being more of
              a time correction than a steep price correction. We haven't had a blow-off
              top, and I don't think we're going to see a crash back to thirty or
              forty thousand either. What we're likely looking at is a long consolidation,
              trading between $70K and $100K, as the market works through the oversupply
              of old Bitcoin that's been reactivated and sold, alongside a lack of
              clear catalysts to turn marginal sellers into buyers.”
