              person, but only 11.6 kg of e-waste collected. That 20.6 kg gap = growing
              stock of devices. The upcoming Circular Economy Act aims to boost high-quality

          - text: 'Crypto Midweek | Risk-Off Takes Hold Geopolitical tensions and
              renewed AI investment concerns are converging, pushing markets into
              a clear risk-off stance. U.S. equities slid for a fourth straight session
              as safe havens—gold and oil—moved higher. In crypto, BTC volatility
              spiked. After briefly testing 90K, Bitcoin reversed with risk appetite
              and drifted back toward the 85K zone. Altcoins broadly retraced on lighter
              volumes, keeping sentiment in Extreme Fear (17). What to watch next:
              - U.S. CPI and major central bank decisions (ECB, BoE, Riksbank) - Whether
              macro clarity can stabilize risk assets—or deepen the drawdown Are we
              near a volatility reset, or just mid-cycle noise? 👇'

              rynku. To poziom psychologiczny dla długoterminowych holderów. Utrata

          - text: Loads of people hoped cryptocurrencies such as $BTC and $ETH would
              replace the current monetary system, but as we all know, this isn’t
              possible (yet). Almost nobody directly accepts $BTC, $ETH, or other
              cryptocurrencies, so they’re simply not fit yet to replace the current
              monetary system. +Self-custody, spending limits, and all of those issues
              are still present. $AVICI lets you actually use your crypto without
              giving up control of it. You can send, receive, and spend money worldwide,
              and everything just works in the background when it comes to conversions.
              It feels like regular banking, but you’re still holding your own assets.

          - text: 'Twelve years ago today, one of crypto’s most iconic words was born
              👉 ''HODL'' Bitcoin had just crashed nearly 40% in a single day. Panic
              was spreading fast on the forums. Traders were arguing, emotions were
              high, and many were ready to cut their losses. Then a user named GameKyuubi
              made a post titled: “I AM HODLING” He was slightly drunk, frustrated,
              and honest. In his post, he admitted: “I’m a bad trader and I KNOW I’M
              A BAD TRADER.” “You only sell in a bear market if you are a good day
              trader or an illusioned noob.” So he decided to hodl. He meant to write
              "holding," but the typo stuck. And that typo changed crypto forever.
              What started as a late-night rant turned into a rallying cry. HODL became
              a symbol. A mindset. A way of saying: “I’m staying in this no matter
              what.” It meant holding on through the chaos, the dips, the fear, and
              the bear markets. It meant conviction, not panic. Over time, people
              even gave it a new meaning: ''Hold On for Dear Life''. Twelve years
              later, the word is still with us. Not just as a meme, but as a reminder
              that belief matters more than timing. HODL on.'

          - text: Bitcoin zbliża się do poziomu decydującego o zachowaniu inwestorów!
              Bitcoin handluje w strefie, która może przesądzić o dalszym zachowaniu
              rynku. To poziom psychologiczny dla długoterminowych holderów. Utrata
              wsparcia może zwiększyć presję sprzedażową. Utrzymanie poziomu sprzyja
              cierpliwości inwestorów.
