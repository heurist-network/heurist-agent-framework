          - text: 'SOLD Prism​.app for $120,000 USD Congrats to the buyer! Prism is
              a highly sought-after premium brand name. In September, we published
              33 .APP sales (status/1965060633990475950), stating our expectation
              of more six-figure .APP sales going forward. The growth of .APP into
              a TLD widely recognized as one of the main players in the market has
              been remarkable. From the earliest recorded .APP (re)sale of $3,000
              in May 2018, which we had the privilege of scoring, to 2026, when founders
              spend six-figure sums on premium .APP domains with confidence. Here''s
              the data from the 20 most recent reports for TLDs used by projects launched
              daily on Product Hunt, provided by @LeanneMac: Projects launched on
              .APP: 473 Projects launched on .AI: 413 And the one that has gained
              ground since September is .APP – not .AI. On Product Hunt, .APP is now
              second only to .COM, among all existing TLDs. An outstanding achievement
              for the TLD, with strong data confirming .APP''s status as the most
              in-demand new gTLD. The agreement on Prism​.app was reached via TD,
              and we chose our partner, GoDaddy, to secure the transaction. Thanks
              to Mauli for the excellent support. Once again, congrats to the buyer
              on acquiring Prism.'

          - text: '"Core Scientific", a Bitcoin mining company, sold approximately
              2,050 BTC through OTC transactions during the month of January. There
              are two key points worth noting: - This was their first Bitcoin sale
              in about a year, since December 2024. - It was the largest amount of
              Bitcoin sold in a single month. This is not a positive signal. If the
              market environment were truly healthy and strong,there would be little
              reason to sell such a large amount of Bitcoin at this point. It’s possible
              that Core Scientific is shifting its focus, at least for now, away from
              Bitcoin mining and toward AI and data infrastructure businesses instead.'

        \ A significant recent development is the introduction of @moltbook, a social\
        \ network specifically for these AI agents, demonstrating his commitment to\
        \ building an ecosystem around them.\n3.  **Technology & Venture Capital:**\
        \ Consistent with his profile, he amplifies news from tech startups like Solo\
        \ (biometric verification) and INGOS (virtual machines), aligning with his\
        \ role in an AI fund and as a tech CEO.\n4.  **Broader Social & Tech Commentary:**\
        \ He occasionally engages with wider topics like social media regulation and\
        \ sustainability through retweets."

      query: Find recent tweets mentioning Bitcoin and summarize the discussion
    output:
      response: "Here's a summary of recent tweets mentioning Bitcoin:\n\nThe recent\
        \ discussion around Bitcoin highlights a **mixed market sentiment**, with\
        \ several key themes emerging:\n\n1.  **Performance vs. Gold/Silver:** A prominent\
        \ topic is Bitcoin's performance relative to gold. Some users note that Bitcoin\
        \ has been in a bear market against gold for the past 14 months or even 5\
        \ years, with gold currently outperforming. However, others express optimism,\
        \ suggesting that gold's recent surge might signal a broader \"money rotation\"\
        \ that could eventually benefit Bitcoin, or that Bitcoin has the potential\
        \ to reach the market capitalization of silver.\n2.  **Regulatory & Institutional\
        \ Adoption:**\n    *   A significant bullish point is a reported statement\
        \ by **SEC Chair Atkins** suggesting that 401(k) accounts should be allowed\
        \ to invest in Bitcoin, which could lead to \"trillions of demand.\"\n   \
        \ *   In the UK, the **House of Lords** is inquiring into stablecoins, with\
        \ concerns raised about treating \"unbacked Bitcoin\" the same way as fiat-backed\
        \ stablecoins in regulations, indicating ongoing debate about its classification.\n\
        3.  **Market Dynamics & Resilience:** Some believe Bitcoin is overcoming past\
        \ \"crypto contagion\" and has a history of climbing \"walls of worry\" despite\
        \ temporary concerns (e.g., \"quantum fears\"). However, there's an observation\
        \ that while Ether ETFs are seeing inflows, Bitcoin is currently experiencing\
        \ outflows. Long-term, some see Bitcoin as an attractive investment when fiat\
        \ currencies devalue, emphasizing diversification.\n4.  **Technological &\
        \ Commercial Integration:** Tweets also touch on historical context, like\
        \ Hal Finney's 2010 descriptions of Bitcoin-backed stablecoins. Modern integration\
        \ includes HIVE highlighting its dual data center platform for Bitcoin and\
        \ AI, and even consumer-level promotions, such as Steak 'n Shake offering\
        \ Bitcoin rewards.\n\nIn essence, while there are some concerns about Bitcoin's\
        \ recent price action compared to gold and current outflows, the overall sentiment\
        \ is buoyed by potential massive institutional adoption via 401(k)s and a\
        \ belief in its long-term resilience and evolving utility."

              operates: - Gold does well while Bitcoin doesn''t, giving people concern.
              - Concern turns into walls of worry, this time it''s quantum fears.
              - Bitcoin climbs the wall of worry and moves on. We are at step 2.'
