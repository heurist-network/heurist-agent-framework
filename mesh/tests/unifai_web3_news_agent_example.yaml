          summary: 'Bitcoin Core developers have decided to remove a limit on transaction
            data in the next network upgrade, enabling more data to be included in
            a more efficient way. “Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay
            and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow
            any number of these outputs,” read the announcement on GitHub by Bitcoin
            developer Greg Sanders on May 5. The long-standing limit was originally
            a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment
            proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. The proposal
            (PR 32359) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of
            Chaincode Labs. OP_RETURN is a special type of Bitcoin (BTC) transaction
            output that allows storing small amounts of data on the blockchain, popularized
            during the ordinals inscriptions craze in early 2024.Unlike regular transaction
            outputs, OP_RETURN outputs are not spendable and don’t bloat unspent transaction
            outputs (UTXOs).The original limit is no longer effective as people found
            ways around it, such as using fake output addresses, which are actually
            worse for the network, while some mining services were already ignoring
            the limit, said Sanders. “Large-data inscriptions are happening regardless
            and can be done in more or less abusive ways; the cap merely channels
            them into more opaque forms that cause damage to the network.” Related:
            Bitcoin block size could grow to 4 MB with inscriptions: ResearchBenefits
            of removing the limit include a cleaner UTXO set, or database of spendable
            outputs, more consistent behavior across the network, and better alignment
            with how Bitcoin is actually being used, he added. Three possible paths
            were considered: keeping the cap, raising the cap and removing the cap,
            which was ultimately decided upon after earning “broad, though not perhaps
            unanimous, support.” A controversial change to Bitcoin “Many users find
            this to be an undesirable change for a number of reasons,” said Bitcoiner
            Samson Mow on X on May 5. He added that users “can refuse to upgrade and
            stay on 29.0 or run another implementation” of the network. Critics said
            that the proposal was introduced without a proper consensus process. “I
            think one thing is pretty clear, there is no consensus at the moment on
            this OP_RETURN issue,” said Ten31 Fund managing partner Marty Bent.Some
            also expressed concerns about deprioritizing Bitcoin’s financial utility
            and raised questions about undisclosed conflicts of interest.Critics of

          summary: 'Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto
            lending platform Celsius, has blasted the government''s 20-year “venom-laced”
            sentence request, declaring it a “death-in-prison sentence.”The US Department
            of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in
            the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting
            from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old
            79 if he serves the whole sentence.Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued
            in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he
            should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn''t taken into
            account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously
            unblemished 30-year history in business. “The government''s venom-laced
            submission recasts this case as one involving a predator with an intent
            to target victims, harm them, and steal their money,” they said.“It concludes
            by recommending that a first time, nonviolent offender who pled guilty
            and accepts responsibility receive a death-in-prison sentence.”Lawyers
            acting for Mashinsky argue the DOJ has ignored their client''s background
            in its sentencing request. Source: Court ListenerMashinsky pleaded guilty
            to two out of seven charges As part of a plea agreement, Mashinsky pleaded
            guilty in December 2024 to commodities fraud and manipulating the price
            of CEL, earning $48 million by selling his holdings before Celsius collapsed
            in June 2022. Prosecutors initially filed seven charges in July 2023.Lawyers
            acting for Mashinsky allege the DOJ’s push for a 20-year sentence is because
            their client is unwilling to “capitulate to the government’s exaggerated
            characterizations of his actions,” specifically that he was a “fraud from
            the get-go.” “Alex is inserted as the scapegoat for every corporate action,
            every group decision, every unanimous vote, every market fluctuation,
            and every employee''s watercooler speculation,” they said.As part of its
            April 28 sentencing request, the DOJ said Mashinsky’s guilty plea showed
            that his crimes were deliberate, calculated decisions to lie, deceive
            and steal.Days earlier on April 23, US federal prosecutors also filed
            statements from hundreds of victims who lost money due to the Celsius
            collapse. They detailed how some had entrusted their life savings to the
            protocol, believing Mashinsky’s assurances that it was safe.Related: What
            do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky?Celsius filed for Chapter
            11 bankruptcy on July 13, 2022, owing $4.7 billion to creditors after
            halting withdrawals in June, citing volatile market conditions.In November
            2023, a US bankruptcy court approved Celsius'' restructuring plan to repay
            customers, and in August 2024, $2.53 billion was paid to 251,000 creditors.Former
            Celsius chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon also pleaded guilty in
            September 2023 to similar charges, but his Dec. 11 sentencing has been
            delayed until after Mashinsky is sentenced.Magazine: Crypto wanted to

          summary: 'The Israel-based eToro Group says it’s looking for a valuation
            of up to $4 billion with its initial public offering in the US, as the
            stock and crypto trading platform forges ahead with listing on the Nasdaq.The
            company and existing stockholders are aiming to raise $500 million through
            offering a total of 10 million shares priced between $46 to $50 apiece,
            eToro said on May 5.A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission
            shows eToro is offering 5 million shares, with a further 5 million being
            put up by the likes of the company’s co-founder and CEO, Yoni Assia; his
            brother and executive director, Ronen Assia; along with venture firms
            Spark Capital, BRM Group and Andalusian Private Capital, among others.The
            company offers stock and crypto trading targeting retail and plans to
            list on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker “ETOR.”It''s
            slated to compete with Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), which saw crypto
            trading dip in the first quarter but whose shares have climbed by nearly
            30% so far this year, according to Google Finance.In the filing, eToro
            said some BlackRock funds and accounts indicated interest in buying up
            to $100 million worth of shares at IPO. eToro has also put aside 500,000
            shares to sell through a directed share program, typically targeted at
            employees.The company reported that its revenue from crypto in 2024 was
            $12.1 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2023. It expected crypto to account
            for 37% of its commission from trading activity in the first quarter of
            2025, down from 43% in the year-ago quarter.Source: Matthew SigelIn a
            section of its filing listing possible risks to the business, eToro warned
            its users could leave, or it could struggle to get more users, due to
            negative perceptions of the cryptocurrencies it lists, “either as a result
            of media coverage or by experiencing significant losses.”Other crypto-related
            risks the eToro flagged included US state-level crypto regulation, which
            it said “may place strain on our resources and make it difficult to operate
            in certain jurisdictions, if at all.”It also said it expects “to continue
            to incur significant costs” due to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets
            (MiCA) laws “on an ongoing basis.”IPOs ready to push after Trump tariff
            jolt EToro initially made confidential filings with the SEC in January
            for a public offering, before publicly announcing the plans on March 24.The
            company reportedly delayed its IPO after President Donald Trump’s April
            2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements tanked global markets and stopped
            many in-the-works public offerings.Related: Are Donald Trump’s tariffs

            amid the uncertainty.Crypto exchange Kraken is also reportedly considering
            a public offering for early next year, which has accelerated its plan
            with Trump’s election.EToro’s public offering is led by Goldman Sachs,

          summary: 'A Russian-Israeli citizen allegedly involved in the $190 million
            Nomad bridge hack will soon be extradited to the US after he was reportedly
            arrested at an Israeli airport while boarding a flight to Russia. Alexander
            Gurevich will be investigated for his alleged involvement in several “computer
            crimes,” including laundering millions of dollars and transferring stolen
            property allegedly connected to the Nomad Bridge hack in 2022, The Jerusalem
            Post reported on May 5.Gurevich returned to Israel from an overseas trip
            on April 19 but was ordered to appear before the Jerusalem District Court
            for an extradition hearing soon after, according to the report. On April
            29, Gurevich changed his name in Israel’s Population Registry to “Alexander
            Block” and received a passport under that name at Israel’s Ben-Gurion
            Airport the next day.He was arrested at the same airport two days later,
            on May 1, while waiting to board a flight to Russia. Gurevich allegedly
            identified a vulnerability in the Nomad bridge, which he exploited and
            stole roughly $2.89 million worth of tokens from in August 2022.Dozens
            of copycat hackers discovered and capitalized on the security vulnerability
            soon after, leading to a total loss of $190 million.Gurevich allegedly
            reached out to a Nomad executive on TelegramProsecutors allege that shortly
            after the hack, Gurevich messaged Nomad’s chief technology officer, James
            Prestwich, on Telegram using a fake identity, admitting that he had been
            “amateurishly” seeking a crypto protocol to exploit.He allegedly apologized
            for “the trouble he caused Prestwich and his team” and voluntarily transferred
            about $162,000 into a recovery wallet the company had set up.Prestwich
            told Gurevich that Nomad would pay him 10% of the value of the assets
            he had stolen, to which Gurevich responded that he would consult his lawyer.
            However, Nomad never heard back from him after that.Alleged messages between
            Gurevich and Nomad’s James Prestwich were shared on X by Israel-based
            Walla News journalist Yoav Itiel. Source: Yoav ItielAt some point during
            the negotiations, Gurevich demanded a reward of $500,000 for identifying
            the vulnerability.Related: Do Kwon is in US custody after extradition

            in the Northern District of California on Aug. 16, 2023, in addition to
            obtaining a warrant for his arrest. California is where the team behind
            the Nomad bridge is based.The US submitted a formal extradition request
            in December 2024, the Post noted.The money laundering charges that Gurevich
            faces carry a maximum of 20 years, significantly harsher than the penalties
            he would face in Israel.Gurevich is believed to have arrived in Israel
            a few days before the $190 million exploit occurred, prompting Israeli
            officials to believe he carried out the attack while in Israel.Magazine:

            to establish a crypto reserve for the state. The Senate and House agreed
            to extend the session until June 6 to address budget plans. Lawmakers
            passed about 230 bills during the session, dealing with things like prohibiting
            putting fluoride in the water, protecting state parks, and a school smartphone

            Digital Assets Strategic Reserve bill would have permitted Arizona to
            invest seized funds into Bitcoin and create a reserve managed by state
            officials. The move drew the ire of crypto advocates and Bitcoiners, including
            entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, who said: “Imagine the ignorance of a
            politician to believe they can make investment decisions.”“Arizona has

            reserve,” said Satoshi Action Fund founder Dennis Porter on May 5, citing
            an article from Fox’s Eleanor Terrett. He added that the most likely to

          summary: 'Bitcoin Core developers have decided to remove a limit on transaction
            data in the next network upgrade, enabling more data to be included in
            a more efficient way. “Bitcoin Core’s next release will, by default, relay
            and mine transactions whose OP_RETURN outputs exceed 80 bytes and allow
            any number of these outputs,” read the announcement on GitHub by Bitcoin
            developer Greg Sanders on May 5. The long-standing limit was originally
            a “gentle signal that block space should be used sparingly for non-payment
            proof of publication data,” has outlived its utility, he added. The proposal
            (PR 32359) was created by Bitcoin pioneer Peter Todd at the request of
            Chaincode Labs. OP_RETURN is a special type of Bitcoin (BTC) transaction
            output that allows storing small amounts of data on the blockchain, popularized
            during the ordinals inscriptions craze in early 2024.Unlike regular transaction
            outputs, OP_RETURN outputs are not spendable and don’t bloat unspent transaction
            outputs (UTXOs).The original limit is no longer effective as people found
            ways around it, such as using fake output addresses, which are actually
            worse for the network, while some mining services were already ignoring
            the limit, said Sanders. “Large-data inscriptions are happening regardless
            and can be done in more or less abusive ways; the cap merely channels
            them into more opaque forms that cause damage to the network.” Related:
            Bitcoin block size could grow to 4 MB with inscriptions: ResearchBenefits
            of removing the limit include a cleaner UTXO set, or database of spendable
            outputs, more consistent behavior across the network, and better alignment
            with how Bitcoin is actually being used, he added. Three possible paths
            were considered: keeping the cap, raising the cap and removing the cap,
            which was ultimately decided upon after earning “broad, though not perhaps
            unanimous, support.” A controversial change to Bitcoin “Many users find
            this to be an undesirable change for a number of reasons,” said Bitcoiner
            Samson Mow on X on May 5. He added that users “can refuse to upgrade and
            stay on 29.0 or run another implementation” of the network. Critics said
            that the proposal was introduced without a proper consensus process. “I
            think one thing is pretty clear, there is no consensus at the moment on
            this OP_RETURN issue,” said Ten31 Fund managing partner Marty Bent.Some
            also expressed concerns about deprioritizing Bitcoin’s financial utility
            and raised questions about undisclosed conflicts of interest.Critics of

          summary: 'Alex Mashinsky, the founder and former CEO of bankrupt crypto
            lending platform Celsius, has blasted the government''s 20-year “venom-laced”
            sentence request, declaring it a “death-in-prison sentence.”The US Department
            of Justice requested Mashinsky receive at least 20 years behind bars in
            the May 8 sentencing for his role in misleading Celsius users and profiting
            from the price manipulation of Celsius (CEL), which would make the 59-year-old
            79 if he serves the whole sentence.Lawyers acting for Mashinsky argued
            in a May 5 reply memorandum filed in a New York district court that he
            should receive no more than 366 days, because the DOJ hasn''t taken into
            account his status as a nonviolent first-time offender with a previously
            unblemished 30-year history in business. “The government''s venom-laced
            submission recasts this case as one involving a predator with an intent
            to target victims, harm them, and steal their money,” they said.“It concludes
            by recommending that a first time, nonviolent offender who pled guilty
            and accepts responsibility receive a death-in-prison sentence.”Lawyers
            acting for Mashinsky argue the DOJ has ignored their client''s background
            in its sentencing request. Source: Court ListenerMashinsky pleaded guilty
            to two out of seven charges As part of a plea agreement, Mashinsky pleaded
            guilty in December 2024 to commodities fraud and manipulating the price
            of CEL, earning $48 million by selling his holdings before Celsius collapsed
            in June 2022. Prosecutors initially filed seven charges in July 2023.Lawyers
            acting for Mashinsky allege the DOJ’s push for a 20-year sentence is because
            their client is unwilling to “capitulate to the government’s exaggerated
            characterizations of his actions,” specifically that he was a “fraud from
            the get-go.” “Alex is inserted as the scapegoat for every corporate action,
            every group decision, every unanimous vote, every market fluctuation,
            and every employee''s watercooler speculation,” they said.As part of its
            April 28 sentencing request, the DOJ said Mashinsky’s guilty plea showed
            that his crimes were deliberate, calculated decisions to lie, deceive
            and steal.Days earlier on April 23, US federal prosecutors also filed
            statements from hundreds of victims who lost money due to the Celsius
            collapse. They detailed how some had entrusted their life savings to the
            protocol, believing Mashinsky’s assurances that it was safe.Related: What
            do crypto users want to happen to Alex Mashinsky?Celsius filed for Chapter
            11 bankruptcy on July 13, 2022, owing $4.7 billion to creditors after
            halting withdrawals in June, citing volatile market conditions.In November
            2023, a US bankruptcy court approved Celsius'' restructuring plan to repay
            customers, and in August 2024, $2.53 billion was paid to 251,000 creditors.Former
            Celsius chief revenue officer Roni Cohen-Pavon also pleaded guilty in
            September 2023 to similar charges, but his Dec. 11 sentencing has been
            delayed until after Mashinsky is sentenced.Magazine: Crypto wanted to

            of up to $4 billion with its initial public offering in the US, as the
            stock and crypto trading platform forges ahead with listing on the Nasdaq.The
            company and existing stockholders are aiming to raise $500 million through
            offering a total of 10 million shares priced between $46 to $50 apiece,
            eToro said on May 5.A filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission
            shows eToro is offering 5 million shares, with a further 5 million being
            put up by the likes of the company’s co-founder and CEO, Yoni Assia; his
            brother and executive director, Ronen Assia; along with venture firms
            Spark Capital, BRM Group and Andalusian Private Capital, among others.The
            company offers stock and crypto trading targeting retail and plans to
            list on the tech-heavy Nasdaq Global Select Market under the ticker “ETOR.”It''s
            slated to compete with Robinhood Markets Inc. (HOOD), which saw crypto
            trading dip in the first quarter but whose shares have climbed by nearly
            30% so far this year, according to Google Finance.In the filing, eToro
            said some BlackRock funds and accounts indicated interest in buying up
            to $100 million worth of shares at IPO. eToro has also put aside 500,000
            shares to sell through a directed share program, typically targeted at
            employees.The company reported that its revenue from crypto in 2024 was
            $12.1 billion, up from $3.4 billion in 2023. It expected crypto to account
            for 37% of its commission from trading activity in the first quarter of
            2025, down from 43% in the year-ago quarter.Source: Matthew SigelIn a
            section of its filing listing possible risks to the business, eToro warned
            its users could leave, or it could struggle to get more users, due to
            negative perceptions of the cryptocurrencies it lists, “either as a result
            of media coverage or by experiencing significant losses.”Other crypto-related
            risks the eToro flagged included US state-level crypto regulation, which
            it said “may place strain on our resources and make it difficult to operate
            in certain jurisdictions, if at all.”It also said it expects “to continue
            to incur significant costs” due to the European Union’s Markets in Crypto-Assets
            (MiCA) laws “on an ongoing basis.”IPOs ready to push after Trump tariff
            jolt EToro initially made confidential filings with the SEC in January
            for a public offering, before publicly announcing the plans on March 24.The
            company reportedly delayed its IPO after President Donald Trump’s April
            2 “Liberation Day” tariff announcements tanked global markets and stopped

            stole roughly $2.89 million worth of tokens from in August 2022.Dozens
            of copycat hackers discovered and capitalized on the security vulnerability
            soon after, leading to a total loss of $190 million.Gurevich allegedly
            reached out to a Nomad executive on TelegramProsecutors allege that shortly
            after the hack, Gurevich messaged Nomad’s chief technology officer, James
            Prestwich, on Telegram using a fake identity, admitting that he had been
            “amateurishly” seeking a crypto protocol to exploit.He allegedly apologized
            for “the trouble he caused Prestwich and his team” and voluntarily transferred
            about $162,000 into a recovery wallet the company had set up.Prestwich
            told Gurevich that Nomad would pay him 10% of the value of the assets
            he had stolen, to which Gurevich responded that he would consult his lawyer.
            However, Nomad never heard back from him after that.Alleged messages between
            Gurevich and Nomad’s James Prestwich were shared on X by Israel-based
            Walla News journalist Yoav Itiel. Source: Yoav ItielAt some point during
            the negotiations, Gurevich demanded a reward of $500,000 for identifying
            the vulnerability.Related: Do Kwon is in US custody after extradition

            in the Northern District of California on Aug. 16, 2023, in addition to
            obtaining a warrant for his arrest. California is where the team behind
            the Nomad bridge is based.The US submitted a formal extradition request
            in December 2024, the Post noted.The money laundering charges that Gurevich
            faces carry a maximum of 20 years, significantly harsher than the penalties
            he would face in Israel.Gurevich is believed to have arrived in Israel
            a few days before the $190 million exploit occurred, prompting Israeli
            officials to believe he carried out the attack while in Israel.Magazine:

          summary: 'Two Florida crypto bills have been removed from the legislative
            process in the latest blow to American state-level strategic Bitcoin reserve
            ambitions. Florida’s House Bill 487 and Senate Bill 550 have been “indefinitely
            postponed and withdrawn from consideration” on May 3, according to the
            Florida Senate. Florida’s legislative session adjourned on May 2 without
            the passage of these two bills, which would have advanced legislation
            to establish a crypto reserve for the state. The Senate and House agreed
            to extend the session until June 6 to address budget plans. Lawmakers
            passed about 230 bills during the session, dealing with things like prohibiting
            putting fluoride in the water, protecting state parks, and a school smartphone
            ban, but diversifying state treasury portfolios was not among them. State

            which was introduced in February, would have allowed Florida’s chief financial
            officer and the State Board of Administration to invest up to 10% of certain
            state funds into Bitcoin (BTC).SB 550 was also filed in February to enable
            investments of public funds in Bitcoin.Related: Alabama, Minnesota lawmakers

            which have all seen Bitcoin bills fail to pass House or Senate votes,
            according to Bitcoin Laws. Arizona has two more chances It came just days
            after Arizona advanced its strategic Bitcoin reserve legislation further
            than any other state, until House Bill 1025 was vetoed by Governor Katie
            Hobbs, who labelled digital assets “untested investments” on May 3.The
            Digital Assets Strategic Reserve bill would have permitted Arizona to
            invest seized funds into Bitcoin and create a reserve managed by state
            officials. The move drew the ire of crypto advocates and Bitcoiners, including
            entrepreneur Anthony Pompliano, who said: “Imagine the ignorance of a
            politician to believe they can make investment decisions.”“Arizona has
            two more chances to be the first in the nation to establish a Bitcoin
            reserve,” said Satoshi Action Fund founder Dennis Porter on May 5, citing
            an article from Fox’s Eleanor Terrett. He added that the most likely to
            pass is HB 2749, which offers a budget-neutral method to fund the reserve
            using profit from the unclaimed property fund.Source: Dennis PorterThere
            is also a related bill, SB 1373, which would authorize the state treasurer
            to allocate up to 10% of Arizona state funds into digital assets. It has
            yet to reach a final vote.Magazine: Bitcoin to $1M ‘by 2029,’ CIA tips
