        query: What's happening with DeFi markets?
        response: "The DeFi landscape is undergoing a rapid transformation, with evolving\
          \ narratives and technological innovations that are reshaping the space.\
          \ Based on the recent market updates, here are the key developments:\n\n\
          1. Convergence of AI and Real-World Assets  \n • Projects like $TRUE are\
          \ at the forefront, integrating artificial intelligence with tokenized real-world\
          \ assets to bridge traditional finance and blockchain. These initiatives\
          \ are designed to overcome the limitations of earlier DeFi systems that\
          \ lacked real-world backing, offering improved trading strategies and yield\
          \ mechanisms.  \n • Similarly, platforms like $AIDEFI are launching as multichain\
          \ automation protocols. By harnessing AI, these solutions aim to streamline\
          \ everything from swap execution to multi-wallet management, thereby removing\
          \ much of the complexity inherent in on-chain operations.\n\n2. Evolving\
          \ Fundraising and ICO Trends  \n • The market is witnessing a resurgence\
          \ in ICO activity, highlighted by projects such as DeXRP. With details like\
          \ over $6 million raised in its presale, 8,000+ participants, and robust\
          \ staking mechanisms, these initiatives signal the reemergence of ICOs driven\
          \ by renewed investor enthusiasm.  \n • This new wave isn’t merely about\
          \ speculative fundraising but is supported by solid fundamentals, including\
          \ audits, strategic partnerships (for example, those between DeXRP and notable\
          \ industry players like Cwallet and Micro3), and a clear roadmap for DEX\
          \ launches and token governance.\n\n3. Shifting Focus from TVL to Cash Flow\
          \ and Transparency  \n • There is a discernible trend shifting the investment\
          \ narrative from total value locked (TVL) to real-time revenue generation\
          \ and cash flow. Developers and investors are increasingly paying attention\
          \ to live protocol revenues, fee structures, and on-chain transparency as\
          \ markers of project viability.  \n • Platforms like DefiLlama now provide\
          \ live data on revenues and protocol fees, empowering both founders and\
          \ institutional investors with more granular insights into the market’s\
          \ day-to-day dynamics.\n\n4. Enhanced Automation and Interoperability  \n\
           • DeFi aggregators and innovative trading protocols are leveraging smart\
          \ contract capabilities to create aggregated interfaces that optimize transaction\
          \ paths and reduce overall costs. This evolution is making complex multi-chain\
          \ operations more accessible to everyday users.  \n • Emerging projects\
          \ are also exploring cross-chain strategies—multiple updates mention initiatives\
          \ on platforms like Base and Silo Avalanche—showing that interoperability\
          \ is becoming a critical focus as projects look to integrate assets across\
          \ different ecosystems seamlessly.\n\n5. Institutional Attention and Regulatory\
          \ Convergence  \n • The market is receiving significant interest from institutional\
          \ players who are increasingly drawn to the transparency and efficiency\
          \ that DeFi offers. Automated yield strategies, constantly updated on-chain\
          \ metrics, and innovative financial products (including emerging ETFs linked\
          \ to cryptocurrencies like XRP and DOGE) are creating bridges between traditional\
          \ finance and blockchain technology.  \n • Regulatory scrutiny is also evolving;\
          \ while traditional finance debates (such as weekly earnings and accounting\
          \ practices) are giving way to real-time metrics in DeFi, there is a growing\
          \ emphasis on ensuring such transparency remains robust and reliable.\n\n\
          Overall, the DeFi market is maturing rapidly. The integration of AI-driven\
          \ strategies, real-world asset tokenization, enhanced interoperability,\
          \ and a shift toward sustainable revenue models are converging to create\
          \ a more robust, transparent, and financially integrated ecosystem. This\
          \ evolution not only challenges traditional financial paradigms but also\
          \ opens the door for a new era of decentralized finance that is more accessible,\
          \ secure, and aligned with real-world economic activities."

        \n2.  Key Technical Levels and Price Action\n    •   Bitcoin is trading in\

      query: Analyze the current crypto market sentiment over the last 14 days
    output:
      response: "Over the last 14 days, the overall sentiment in the crypto market\
        \ has been neutral, with traders and investors cautiously positioned as they\
        \ await additional macro cues. Here’s a detailed breakdown of the market dynamics:\n\
        \n1. Overall Sentiment Indicators\n  Multiple reports have shown the Fear\
        \ & Greed Index stubbornly staying around 51–52 out of 100, which clearly\
        \ signals a neutral environment.\n  Despite some volatility in previous periods,\
        \ the market appears to be “catching its breath” with Bitcoin and major altcoins\
        \ consolidating near key support levels.\n\n2. Technical Insights and Price\
        \ Action\n  Bitcoin has been hovering near its support region (around the\
        \ low $115K area) while traders keep a close eye on a potential breakout in\
        \ either direction.\n  The market’s technical indicators reflect a consolidation\
        \ phase rather than one of aggressive bullish or bearish momentum.\n  Altcoins\
        \ are showing increased momentum with Altseason Index readings rising (with\
        \ recent values from 67 up to 82), suggesting that while overall sentiment\
        \ remains neutral, the altcoin segment is experiencing relative strength.\n\
        \n3. Macro Environment and Cautious Positioning\n  The crypto community is\
        \ focused on the upcoming FOMC meeting and anticipated Fed rate cuts; many\
        \ expect that a dovish tone could serve as a catalyst for a more bullish move.\n\
        \  With uncertainty pervading due to broader equity market dynamics and potential\
        \ shifts in monetary policy, market participants are carefully rotating positions\
        \ and waiting for clearer direction from policymakers.\n\n4. Summary\nOver\
        \ this period, the market is characterized by consolidation and cautious anticipation.\
        \ Although minor signals hint at potential altcoin strength—with indexes moving\
        \ into the higher range—the prevailing view is one of neutrality. Traders\
        \ remain on the sidelines until clearer macroeconomic signals emerge, meaning\
