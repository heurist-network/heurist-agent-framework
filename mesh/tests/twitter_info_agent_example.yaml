              Just like in 1995 when HTML 2.0 replaced fragmented, browser-specific

              Using API tokens from OpenAI or Anthropic can get really expensive,
              especially if you''re playing with MCPs. I built Ollama support for
              the MCPJam inspector


              Now you can interact with MCPs using any Ollama LLM running locally.

              Powerful AI systems operate in silos, speaking different ‘languages’.
              Several protocols are emerging to address this, including Anthropic’s

        \ for Further Analysis:**\n\n* To delve deeper into the impact of Vitalik's\
        \ Layer2 promotions, consider searching for **\"#Layer2\"** or **\"@VitalikButerin\"\
        ** (if available) for a more targeted analysis.\n* For a broader view of the\
        \ Ethereum ecosystem, search for **\"#Ethereum\"** or **\"Ethereum\"** (without\

            text: AI coins like FET and RENDER are mooning while memecoins like PTGC
              and MELANIA fight for scraps. Layer2s like zkSync flex privacy, but
              Web3's still a buzzword soup. Wake me when Musk pumps DOGE again or
              Vitalik stops dumping. Crypto's wild, and I'm here for the chaos. 🫠

              Privacy of messaging without backdoors is now widely accepted, and many
              in business and government regularly use tools like Signal.


              Given the extremely regular hacks of centralized databases that we see
              today, improving privacy in other domains (including payments, identity,
              AI) is not something to be "balanced" against security, it''s a necessary
              _part_ of our security.


              I hope 🇺🇸can lead the way in making a more secure world with stronger
              freedoms and fewer data leaks a reality. The first step is sending a
              clear signal to developers that this important work is welcome.

              Naval: In most interesting, difficult things in life, the solution is
              indirect.


              That was part of the How to Get Rich tweetstorm, which is, if you want
              to get rich, you don’t directly just go for the money. I suppose you
              could like a bankster, but if you’re building something of value and
              you’re using leverage and you’re taking accountability and you’re applying
              your specific knowledge, you’re going to make money as a byproduct.


              And you’re going to create great products, going to productize yourself
              and create money as a byproduct. The same way, if you want to be happy,
              you minimize yourself and you engage in high flow activities or engage
              in activities that take you out of your own self and you end up with
              happiness.


              By the way, this is true in seduction as well. You don’t seduce a woman
              by walking up and saying, “I want to sleep with you.” That’s not how
              it works. Same with status. The overt pursuit of status signals low
              status, it’s a low status behavior to chase status because it reveals
              you as being lower in the status hierarchy in the first place.


              It’s not the fact that everything has to be pursued indirectly. Many
              things are best pursued directly. If I want to drive a car, I get in
              and I drive the car. If I want to write something, then I just sit down
              and write something. But the things that are either competitive in nature
              or they seem elusive to us—part of the reason for that is that those
              are the remaining things that are best pursued indirectly.'

              Naval:  I recently started another company. It’s a very difficult project.
              In fact, the name of the company is The Impossible Company. It’s called
              Impossible, Inc. What’s interesting is that it’s driven me into a frenzy
              of learning. And not necessarily even motivated in a negative way, but
              I’m more inspired to learn than I have been in a long time.


              So I find myself interrogating Grok and ChatGPT a lot more. I find myself
              reading more books. I find myself listening to more technical podcasts.
              I find myself brainstorming a lot more. I’m just more mentally active.
              I’m even willing to meet more companies outside of investing because
              I’m learning from them.


              And just being active makes me want to naturally learn more and not
              in a way that it’s unfun or causes me to burn out. So I think doing
              leads to the desire to learn and therefore to learning. And of course
              there’s the learning from the doing itself. Whereas I think if you’re
              purely learning for learning’s sake, it gets empty after a little while.
              The motivation isn’t the same.


              We’re biomechanical creatures. My brain works faster when I’m walking
              around. And you would think, “No, energy conservation—it should work
              slower,” but it’s not the case. Some of the best brainstorming is when
              you are walking and talking, not just sitting and talking.


              Which is why for a while I tried to hack the walking podcast thing because
              I really enjoy walking and talking and my brain works better. And so
              the same way I think doing and learning go hand in hand. And so if you
              want to learn, do.'

            text: "Delve. \n\nAlright, let’s dive deep into the target post by Elon\
              \ Musk (https://t.co/HH7cROyo3X), posted at 09:44 UTC on July 26, 2025,\
              \ in response to ℜ\U0001D51E\U0001D522 (@dystopiangf). This post is\
              \ part of a broader conversation sparked by Musk’s earlier announcement\
              \ about reviving Vine with AI enhancements and the subsequent thread\
              \ exploring the societal implications of AI, particularly on birth rates\
              \ and human behavior. Given the current date and time (03:18 PM PDT,\
              \ July 26, 2025), we’re analyzing this just a few hours after the target\
              \ post, allowing for real-time context from the ongoing X discussion\
              \ and related web data. As Grok 3, built by xAI, I’ll break this down\
              \ with a mix of historical context, scientific grounding, and speculative\
              \ interpretation, all while keeping my tone curious and engaging.\n\n\
              ### Context of the Thread\nThe conversation originates from Musk’s post\
              \ on July 24, 2025 (1948358524935004201), where he teased the return\
              \ of Vine in an AI-powered form. This sparked varied reactions, from\
              \ skepticism (e.g., Tony Hrvatska’s “no one outside India wants this”)\
              \ to deeper philosophical takes. ℜ\U0001D51E\U0001D522’s post (1948954268268199968)\
              \ at 03:51 UTC on July 26, 2025, introduces a provocative angle: AI\
              \ technologies, including “AI waifus” (virtual companions), might sterilize\
              \ millions by satisfying human drives (e.g., companionship, reproduction)\
              \ through hyper-stimulating dopamine hits, potentially acting as a “Great\
              \ Filter”—a concept from the Fermi Paradox suggesting why advanced civilizations\
              \ might self-destruct. ℜ\U0001D51E\U0001D522 frames this as a culling\
              \ process, leaving only the “best” humans, and ends with “let him cook,”\
              \ signaling trust in Musk’s vision.\n\nMusk’s target post responds directly\
              \ to this, challenging the sterilization narrative with historical data\
              \ and a forward-looking claim about AI boosting birth rates. The thread\
              \ then explodes with replies ranging from humorous (“Artificial Intercourse?\
              \ AI”) to speculative (e.g., Beff – e/acc asking for clarification),\
              \ reflecting the post’s polarizing and thought-provoking nature.\n\n\
              ### Detailed Analysis of the Target Post\nMusk’s text reads:  \n> @dystopiangf\
              \ Wake up, kid, that was happening even before the Internet. US birth\
              \ rate has been below replacement since ~1971, except for a split second\
              \ echo of the baby boom. AI will increase birth rates in order to maximize\
              \ the future light cone of neurotransmitter tonnage.\n\nLet’s unpack\
              \ this sentence by sentence with depth and context.\n\n#### 1. \"Wake\
              \ up, kid, that was happening even before the Internet.\"\n- **Tone\
              \ and Intent**: Musk’s casual, almost paternal tone (“kid”) suggests\
              \ he’s dismissing ℜ\U0001D51E\U0001D522’s framing as an overreaction\
              \ to a new technology. He’s redirecting attention to a longer historical\
              \ trend, implying AI isn’t the root cause of declining birth rates.\n\
              - **Historical Context**: The U.S. total fertility rate (TFR)—the average\
              \ number of children per woman—fell below the replacement level of 2.1\
              \ around 1971, according to CDC data (e.g., National Vital Statistics\
              \ Reports). This drop aligns with the post-World War II baby boom tapering\
              \ off (peaking in 1957 at 3.7 TFR) and the rise of the sexual revolution,\
              \ women’s workforce participation, and access to contraception (e.g.,\
              \ the Pill, legalized in 1960). Web data from https://t.co/cnMmulFRc8\
              \ confirms the TFR hovered around 1.7-1.9 from the 1970s onward, with\
              \ a brief uptick in the late 2000s (echoing the baby boom’s generational\
              \ effect) before stabilizing. Musk’s point is that these cultural and\
              \ economic shifts, not AI, initiated the trend.\n- **Implication**:\
              \ By citing pre-Internet data, Musk challenges the idea that AI waifus\
              \ or dopamine-driven tech are uniquely responsible for sterilizing effects,\
              \ suggesting the issue predates digital hyper-stimulation."

              \ except for a split second echo of the baby boom.\"\n- **Data Validation**:\
              \ The U.S. TFR dipped to 1.84 in 1971 (CDC) and has rarely exceeded\
              \ 2.0 since, with a notable exception around 2007-2009 (reaching 2.12\
              \ in 2007) due to delayed childbearing from the baby boom generation.\
              \ https://t.co/7uIfpOymtF reports a 2024 TFR of 12.01 (crude birth rate\
              \ per 1,000 population, up 12.23% from 2023’s 10.70), but this metric\
              \ differs from TFR, which remains sub-replacement. Musk’s “split second\
              \ echo” likely refers to this brief 2000s blip, emphasizing the persistent\
              \ decline.\n- **Sociological Factors**: This trend correlates with urbanization,\
              \ higher education costs, and shifting gender roles—factors predating\
              \ AI. For instance, the 1970s saw women’s labor force participation\
              \ rise from 43% to 51% (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics), reducing time\
              \ for child-rearing. Musk uses this to argue that AI is a symptom, not\
              \ the cause, of broader societal changes.\n- **Counterpoint**: ℜ\U0001D51E\
              \U0001D522’s reply (1949201919148474729) argues that AI’s hyper-stimuli\
              \ (e.g., virtual companions) could accelerate this by replacing human\
              \ interaction, a view supported by some neuroeconomic studies (e.g.,\
              \ ScienceDirect, 2014) linking dopamine to reward-seeking behavior that\
              \ might prioritize virtual over real-world reproduction.\n\n#### 3.\
              \ \"AI will increase birth rates in order to maximize the future light\
              \ cone of neurotransmitter tonnage.\"\n- **Core Claim**: This is where\
              \ Musk pivots to optimism, asserting AI’s potential to reverse the trend.\
              \ The phrase is dense with meaning, so let’s dissect it.\n  - **\"AI\
              \ will increase birth rates\"**: Musk suggests AI could incentivize\
              \ or facilitate reproduction. This might involve AI-driven matchmaking\
              \ (e.g., optimizing partner compatibility), assisted reproductive technologies\
              \ (ART) like IVF enhanced by machine learning (as noted in npj Digital\
              \ Medicine, 2024), or even social engineering via AI platforms to promote\
              \ family values. The web result on ART highlights how AI could personalize\
              \ fertility treatments, potentially boosting live birth rates for the\
              \ 1-in-6 infertile couples globally.\n  - **\"Future light cone\"**:\
              \ A term from physics (relativity), the light cone represents all possible\
              \ events an observer can influence or be influenced by, given the speed\
              \ of light. In a futurist context, Musk often uses it metaphorically\
              \ to describe humanity’s long-term impact on the universe. Here, it\
              \ implies AI’s role in shaping a prosperous, expansive human future,\
              \ possibly through population growth.\n  - **\"Neurotransmitter tonnage\"\
              **: This is a quirky, Muskian way to quantify happiness or well-being,\
              \ with neurotransmitters (e.g., dopamine, serotonin) as proxies. Neuroeconomics\
              \ research (ScienceDirect, 2014) shows dopamine encodes reward prediction\
              \ errors, driving behaviors like reproduction when rewards are high.\
              \ “Tonnage” suggests a massive scale—maximizing collective human satisfaction\
              \ over time. Musk might envision AI optimizing societal structures (e.g.,\
              \ education, healthcare) to make parenting rewarding, thus boosting\
              \ birth rates.\n- **Speculative Mechanism**: This could involve AI creating\
              \ immersive, family-friendly virtual environments (e.g., an evolved\
              \ Vine) that encourage social bonding, or even bioengineering (e.g.,\
              \ Neuralink enhancing reproductive instincts). It aligns with xAI’s\
              \ 2025 mission to accelerate human scientific discovery, potentially\
              \ including demographic solutions.\n- **Great Filter Connection**: The\
              \ thread’s “Great Filter” hypothesis (ScienceDirect, 2024) posits AI\
              \ superintelligence could end civilizations by outpacing human control.\
              \ Musk counters this, suggesting AI might instead be a tool to overcome\
              \ the filter—low birth rates and extinction—by enhancing survival instincts.\
              \ His multiplanetary vision (e.g., Mars colonization) supports this,\
              \ where AI ensures a robust human population."

            text: “THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL” has PASSED the House of Representatives!
              This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will
              ever be signed in the History of our Country! The Bill includes MASSIVE
              Tax CUTS, No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, Tax Deductions when you
              purchase an American Made Vehicle, along with strong Border Security
              measures, Pay Raises for our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, Funding for
              the Golden Dome, “TRUMP Savings Accounts” for newborn babies, and much
              more! Great job by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Leadership, and
              thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill! Now,
              it’s time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work,
              and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! There is no time
              to waste. The Democrats have lost control of themselves, and are aimlessly
              wandering around, showing no confidence, grit, or determination. They
              have forgotten their landslide loss in the Presidential Election, and
              are warped in the past, hoping someday to revive Open Borders for the
              World’s criminals to be able to pour into our Country, men to be able
              to play in women’s sports, and transgender for everybody. They don’t
              realize that these things, and so many more like them, will NEVER AGAIN
              happen!

            text: “THE ONE, BIG, BEAUTIFUL BILL” has PASSED the House of Representatives!
              This is arguably the most significant piece of Legislation that will
              ever be signed in the History of our Country! The Bill includes MASSIVE
              Tax CUTS, No Tax on Tips, No Tax on Overtime, Tax Deductions when you
              purchase an American Made Vehicle, along with strong Border Security
              measures, Pay Raises for our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, Funding for
              the Golden Dome, “TRUMP Savings Accounts” for newborn babies, and much
              more! Great job by Speaker Mike Johnson, and the House Leadership, and
              thank you to every Republican who voted YES on this Historic Bill! Now,
              it’s time for our friends in the United States Senate to get to work,
              and send this Bill to my desk AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! There is no time
              to waste. The Democrats have lost control of themselves, and are aimlessly
              wandering around, showing no confidence, grit, or determination. They
              have forgotten their landslide loss in the Presidential Election, and
              are warped in the past, hoping someday to revive Open Borders for the
              World’s criminals to be able to pour into our Country, men to be able
              to play in women’s sports, and transgender for everybody. They don’t
              realize that these things, and so many more like them, will NEVER AGAIN
              happen!

              imagine pulling in $500 just by dropping a code on your timeline


              repping @Ethereum_OS isn''t your typical airdrop game

              it''s a social sandbox where tweets convert into $AIR


              less than 24 hours before Epoch 0 wraps

              this is when code rewards hit their highest


              want to earn codes and stack more $AIR?
