            strikes over the past two weeks. Many of their Fighters and Leaders are
            no longer with us. We hit them every day and night ‚Äî Harder and harder.
            Their capabilities that threaten Shipping and the Region are rapidly being
            destroyed. Our attacks will continue until they are no longer a threat
            to Freedom of Navigation. The choice for the Houthis is clear: Stop shooting
            at U.S. ships, and we will stop shooting at you. Otherwise, we have only
            just begun, and the real pain is yet to come, for both the Houthis and
            their sponsors in Iran.'
