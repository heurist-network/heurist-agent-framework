            title: WalletConnect Pay Is Available Worldwide
            content:
              blocks:
              - text: WalletConnect Pay is launching globally through a landmark partnership
                  with Ingenico, one of the most widely deployed payment terminal
                  providers in the world.
              - text: This enables WalletConnect Pay to be made available to Ignenico's
                  vast customer base of over 40 million point-of-sale terminals in
                  120+ countries, bringing stablecoin payments directly to everyday
                  checkout.
              - text: Who uses Ingenico?
              - text: 'Short answer: almost everyone.'
              - text: Walk into a grocery store, pay for parking, and fill up your
                  car.
              - text: Look closely at the terminal. There is a good chance you will
                  see Ingenico on it.
              - text: Ingenico terminals power payments for some of the world’s largest
                  and most recognisable businesses, including global retailers, fuel
                  networks, and hospitality brands. Companies like Walmart, Costco,
                  Shell, and BP all rely on Ingenico technology as part of their in-store
                  payment infrastructure.
              - text: What’s the rollout plan?
              - text: The initial launch makes WalletConnect Pay on Ingenico terminals
                  available to acquirers and PSPs from January 2026.
              - text: The first merchant activations are expected to roll out across
                  Europe in Q1 and Q2 2026, with further expansion planned as PSPs
                  enable the service across their merchant base.
              - text: Why would a retailer choose WalletConnect Pay?
              - text: 'WalletConnect Pay delivers clear, practical benefits for both
                  merchants and PSPs:'
              - text: Near-instant settlement
              - text: Lower transaction fees
              - text: 24/7 global payments
              - text: A familiar QR-based checkout experience
              - text: Compliant with the existing PSP framework
              - text: Native stablecoin payments
              - text: Take a large retailer operating on tight margins. Traditional
                  card payments often carry average fees of around 2–3%, which can
                  significantly impact profitability at scale.
              - text: On $100 billion in annual payment volume, card fees alone can
                  run into the billions.
              - text: WalletConnect Pay operates at a fraction of those costs. Even
                  modest fee reductions at this scale can translate into millions
                  or even billions saved.
              - text: Those savings can be reinvested into operations, innovation,
                  or passed on to customers through lower prices.
              - text: From global enterprises to local businesses
              - text: This isn’t just about the largest companies in the world. Traditional
                  payment rails create challenges for every business.
              - text: Fees
              - text: Whether you accept cash or cards, fees add up. Processing fees,
                  settlement fees, chargebacks, and intermediaries all take a cut.
              - text: For large enterprises, even a small percentage means enormous
                  sums.
              - text: For a local coffee shop, a few hundred dollars a month matters
                  just as much.
              - text: WalletConnect Pay reduces the cost of getting paid.
              - text: Speed
              - text: A sale made today often takes days to reach a business bank
                  account. By the time funds arrive, fees are deducted and reconciliation
                  is still required.
              - text: With WalletConnect Pay, payments and settlement happen in seconds.
                  In many cases, funds can be settled before the customer leaves the
                  store.
              - text: Faster payments mean better cash flow, for businesses of every
                  size.
              - text: Simplicity
              - text: Today’s checkout is fragmented. Cards, local wallets, regional
                  schemes, closed ecosystems, all with different rules and user experiences.
              - text: WalletConnect Pay simplifies this with one integration and fits
                  cleanly into existing PSP compliance frameworks.
              - text: Any wallet. Any asset. Anywhere.
              - text: The user experience is familiar. Scan. Pay. Go.
              - text: WalletConnect Pay at a global scale
              - text: WalletConnect Pay works across the wallet ecosystem; Customers
                  use the wallets they already trust.
              - text: Every major wallet includes a Scan QR option. WalletConnect
                  is the standard behind that experience.
              - text: Payments complete in seconds.
              - text: Settlement follows just as fast.
              - text: This is what modern payments should feel like.
              - text: What’s next for WalletConnect Pay?
              - text: 'The next phase is focused on three things:'
              - text: Expanding distribution through PSPs and acquirers
              - text: Making merchants aware of the opportunity
              - text: Making paying with stablecoins normal at checkout
              - text: One day, the question won’t be “Do you take Amex?”
              - text: It will be “Do you accept crypto?”
              - text: With WalletConnect Pay, the answer is simple. Yes.

            text: I'm in actual disbelief at how many "bag workers" continue to unfollow
              me for shilling one bag this long. Remember when deranged conviction
              was bullish? When bagworking one single play all day every day was a
              good thing? What happened to this space I loved.

            text: Everyone's shipping apps in a weekend now. But is vibecoding a real
              skill shift or a shiny distraction from deeper work? We're hosting a
              panel with builders from Sapien, Project Mave, 21 DAO, and GPT360 to
              cut through the hype and figure out who should actually pivot.

            text: AnthropicのGit MCP Serverに、複数のゼロデイ脆弱性が発見されました。これは、Model Context Protocol
              (MCP) のGit連携機能のリファレンス実装である「mcp-server-git」に存在する3つの脆弱性を指します。 原因は、Gitの基本的な操作における入力値の検証や、引数のサニタイズ処理が不十分だったことによるものです。
              この脆弱性を悪用されると、攻撃者はプロンプトインジェクションという手法を通じて、システムに直接アクセスすることなく、リモートで任意のコードを実行したり、ファイルを削除したり、機密データを盗み出したりすることが可能になります。
              既に対策済みのバージョン2025.12.18がリリースされていますので、該当するシステムを利用されている方は速やかなアップデートが推奨されます。

              Execution Researchers found three critical bugs in Anthropic’s mcp-server-git
              (pre-2025.12.18) that let attackers abuse LLM tool calls to access arbitrary
              repos, delete/overwrite files, and potentially achieve RCE by writing
              a malicious .git/config and triggering Git clean/smudge filters. This
              matters because combining Git + Filesystem MCP servers turns prompt

      query: What are people saying about Vitalik Buterin?
    output:
      response: 'People are discussing several key points regarding Vitalik Buterin:


        *   **Native DVT Proposal:** Many tweets highlight his proposal for a "native
        DVT (Distributed Validator Technology)" solution to be integrated directly
        into Ethereum''s staking protocol. This aims to enhance network security,
        reduce single points of failure, and promote decentralization by allowing
        validators to register multiple independent keys and use threshold joint signatures.

        *   **Decentralized Social Media:** Buterin commented that crypto social projects
        faltered by financializing user attention. He also suggests a full return
        to decentralized social platforms by 2026, advocating for innovation beyond
        speculative tokens.

        *   **Ethereum''s Future:** Some users mention his vision for Ethereum entering
        "God Mode" in 2026, focusing on enhanced user control, self-sovereignty, and
        a trustless, decentralized ecosystem.

        *   **Recognition:** He is included in a "Top 10 Most Famous People in Crypto"
        list.

        *   **Farcaster Popularity:** One user claimed to have surpassed him in popularity
        on Farcaster and BaseApp.'

              允许验证者注册多个独立密钥，并设定阈值进行联合签名。在保持惩罚机制（slashing）安全的同时，显著提升容错能力。 📈 预期好处： 降低节点运维复杂度
              减少对大型质押服务商的依赖 改善去中心化指标（如 Nakamoto 系数） 🛠 该提案仍处于早期阶段，需经过社区进一步评审与共识推进。
              👉 如果成真，这会是以太坊质押体系的一次重要进化。你支持这个方向吗？

              表示，計畫於 2026 年全面回歸去中心化社交平台，並透露自己已開始使用 X、Lens、Farcaster 與 Bluesky 等多平台的多客戶端工具。Vitalik
              強調，真正的社交創新不應僅止於引入投機性代幣，而是要回到解決社交本身的問題。他批評將代幣機制簡單嫁接到社交產品的做法，認為這往往獎勵的是既有的社會資本，而非內容品質與真實互動。同時，他對
              Lens 生態的未來發展表示樂觀，並呼籲更多人參與 Lens、Farcaster 等去中心化社交平台，探索超越傳統社交媒體的新型互動與治理模式，為開放網路的社交基礎設施奠定長期方向。

        discussing Trustless Agents.

        *   **x402 Protocol Enhancements:** x402 v2 shipped last month, evolving into
        a unified economic layer for AI agents with a "Discovery extension" for structured
        metadata and multi-facilitator routing. Heurist processes millions of x402
        payments and is ranked as a top Base x402 facilitator.

        *   **New Integrations & Partnerships:** Heurist Mesh now integrates @X402Refunds
        for easier refund requests, and they''ve partnered with Zauth (@zauthx402)
        to build a verification layer for x402 endpoints and APIs, enhancing trust
        infrastructure for autonomous commerce.

        *   **Community Engagement & Insights:** Heurist is hosting a panel on January
        21st at 11 AM EST with builders from Sapien, Project Mave, 21 DAO, and GPT360
        to discuss "vibecoding." They also highlighted "Ask Heurist" as a resource
        for understanding ERC-8004, key Ethereum tech in 2026, and information on
        over 10,000,000 tokens traded in DEXs.'

      query: What vitalikbuterin has been posting about?
    output:
      response: 'Vitalik Buterin has been posting extensively about the future of
        Ethereum and decentralized technologies, focusing on several key themes:


        *   **Decentralization and Self-Sovereignty:** He emphasizes Ethereum''s mission
        to build a "more free and open internet" with applications that are resilient,
        censorship-resistant, and "pass the walkaway test" (functioning independently
        of original developers). He frequently criticizes "corposlop" – corporate-driven,
        profit-maximizing, and data-extractive technologies – contrasting it with
        the "sovereign web."

        *   **Technical Scaling and Robustness:** He highlights advancements like
        ZK-EVMs and PeerDAS as crucial for achieving high bandwidth and scalability
        while maintaining decentralization. He also discusses the need for Ethereum
        to "ossify," become quantum-resistant, and simplify its protocol to ensure
        long-term stability.

        *   **Improved DAOs and Governance:** He advocates for "different and better
        DAOs" that leverage privacy (ZK) and AI to enhance human judgment, moving
        beyond current token-holder voting models for applications like oracles, dispute
        resolution, and project maintenance.

        *   **Privacy and Open Source:** He promotes privacy-preserving tools, local-first
        applications, and open-source development to give users greater control over
        their data and digital lives, including algorithmic transparency for social
        media.

        *   **Decentralized Social Media:** He advocates for decentralized social
        platforms (Lens, Farcaster, Bluesky) that prioritize quality content and user
        interests over speculative tokens and short-term engagement.

        *   **AI for Human Augmentation:** He suggests that AI development should
        focus on "human-augmentation tools" that scale and enhance human intention
        and judgment, rather than fully autonomous systems, and should be open source.'

            text: 'In 2026, I plan to be fully back to decentralized social. If we
              want a better society, we need better mass communication tools. We need
              mass communication tools that surface the best information and arguments
              and help people find points of agreement. We need mass communication
              tools that serve the user''s long-term interest, not maximize short-term
              engagement. There is no simple trick that solves these problems. But
              there is one important place to start: more competition. Decentralization
              is the way to enable that: a shared data layer, with anyone being able
              to build their own client on top. In fact, since the start of the year
              I''ve been back to decentralized social already. Every post I''ve made
              this year, or read this year, I made or read with a multi-client that
              covers reading and posting to X, Lens, Farcaster and Bluesky (though
              bluesky has a 300 char limit, so they don''t get to see my beautiful
              long rants). But crypto social projects has often gone the wrong way.
              Too often, we in crypto think that if you insert a speculative coin
              into something, that counts as "innovating", and moves the world forward.
              Mixing money and social is not inherently wrong: Substack shows that
              it''s possible to create an economy that supports very high-quality
              content. But Substack is about _subscribing to creators_, not _creating
              price bubbles around them_. Over the past decade, we have seen many
              many attempts at incentivizing creators by creating price bubbles around
              them, and all fail by (i) rewarding not content quality, but pre-existing
              social capital, and (ii) the tokens all going to zero after one or two
              years anyway. Too many people make galaxy-brained arguments that creating
              new markets and new assets is automatically good because it "elicits
              information", when the rest of their product development actions clearly
              betray that they''re not actually interested in maximizing people''s
              ability to benefit from that information. That is not Hayekian info-utopia,
              that is corposlop. Hence, decentralized social should be run by people
              who deeply believe in the "social" part, and are motivated first and
              foremost by solving the problems of social. The Aave team has done a
              great job stewarding Lens up to this point. I''m excited about what
              will happen to Lens over the next year, because I think the new team
              coming in are people who actually are interested in the "social": even
              back when the decentralized social space barely existed, they were trying
              to figure out how to do encrypted tweets. I plan to post more there
              this year. I encourage everyone to spend more time in Lens, Farcaster
              and the broader decentralized social world this year. We need to move
              beyond everyone constantly tweeting inside a single global info warzone,
              and into a reopened frontier, where new and better forms of interaction
              become possible.'

            text: 'We need more DAOs - but different and better DAOs. The original
              drive to build Ethereum was heavily inspired by decentralized autonomous
              organizations: systems of code and rules that lived on decentralized
              networks that could manage resources and direct activity, more efficiently
              and more robustly than traditional governments and corporations could.
              Since then, the concept of DAOs has migrated to essentially referring
              to a treasury controlled by token holder voting - a design which "works",
              hence why it got copied so much, but a design which is inefficient,
              vulnerable to capture, and fails utterly at the goal of mitigating the
              weaknesses of human politics. As a result, many have become cynical
              about DAOs. But we need DAOs. * We need DAOs to create better oracles.
              Today, decentralized stablecoins, prediction markets, and other basic
              building blocks of defi are built on oracle designs that we are not
              satisfied with. If the oracle is token based, whales can manipulate
              the answer on a subjective issue and it becomes difficult to counteract
              them. Fundamentally, a token-based oracle cannot have a cost of attack
              higher than its market cap, which in turn means it cannot secure assets
              without extracting rent higher than the discount rate. And if the oracle
              uses human curation, then it''s not very decentralized. The problem
              here is not greed. The problem is that we have bad oracle designs, we
              need better ones, and bootstrapping them is not just a technical problem
              but also a social problem. * We need DAOs for onchain dispute resolution,
              a necessary component of many types of more advanced smart contract
              use cases (eg. insurance). This is the same type of problem as price
              oracles, but even more subjective, and so even harder to get right.
              * We need DAOs to maintain lists. This includes: lists of applications
              known to be secure or not scams, lists of canonical interfaces, lists
              of token contract addresses, and much more. * We need DAOs to get projects
              off the ground quickly. If you have a group of people, who all want
              something done and are willing to contribute some funds (perhaps in
              exchange for benefits), then how do you manage this, especially if the
              task is too short-duration for legal entities to be worth it? * We need
              DAOs to do long-term project maintenance. If the original team of a
              project disappears, how can a community keep going, and how can new
              people coming in get the funding they need? One framework that I use
              to analyze this is "convex vs concave" from . If the DAO is solving
              a concave problem, then it is in an environment where, if faced with
              two possible courses of action, a compromise is better than a coin flip.
              Hence, you want systems that maximize robustness by averaging (or rather,
              medianing) in input from many sources, and protect against capture and
              financial attacks. If the DAO is solving a convex problem, then you
              want the ability to make decisive choices and follow through on them.
              In this case, leaders can be good, and the job of the decentralized
              process should be to keep the leaders in check. For all of this to work,
              we need to solve two problems: privacy, and decision fatigue. Without
              privacy, governance becomes a social game (see ). And if people have
              to make decisions every week, for the first month you see excited participation,
              but over time willingness to participate, and even to stay informed,
              declines. I see modern technology as opening the door to a renaissance
              here. Specifically: * ZK (and in some cases MPC/FHE, though these should
              be used only when ZK along cannot solve the problem) for privacy * AI
              to solve decision fatigue * Consensus-finding communication tools (like
              but going further) AI must be used carefully: we must *not* put full-size
              deepseek (or worse, GPT 5.2) in charge of a DAO and call it a day. Rather,
              AI must be put in thoughtfully, as something that scales and enhances
              human intention and judgement, rather than replacing it. This could
              be done at DAO level (eg. see how works), or at individual level (user-controlled
              local LLMs that vote on their behalf). It is important to think about
              the "DAO stack" as also including the communication layer, hence the
              need for forums and platforms specially designed for the purpose. A
              multisig plus well-designed consensus-finding tools can easily beat
              idealized collusion-resistant quadratic funding plus crypto twitter.
              But in all cases, we need new designs. Projects that need new oracles
              and want to build their own should see that as 50% of their job, not
              10%. Projects working on new governance designs should build with ZK
              and AI in mind, and they should treat the communication layer as 50%
              of their job, not 10%. This is how we can ensure the decentralization
              and robustness of the Ethereum base layer also applies to the world
              that gets built on top.'

            text: 'An important, and perenially underrated, aspect of "trustlessness",
              "passing the walkaway test" and "self-sovereignty" is protocol simplicity.
              Even if a protocol is super decentralized with hundreds of thousands
              of nodes, and it has 49% byzantine fault tolerance, and nodes fully
              verify everything with quantum-safe peerdas and starks, if the protocol
              is an unwieldy mess of hundreds of thousands of lines of code and five
              forms of PhD-level cryptography, ultimately that protocol fails all
              three tests: * It''s not trustless because you have to trust a small
              class of high priests who tell you what properties the protocol has
              * It doesn''t pass the walkaway test because if existing client teams
              go away, it''s extremely hard for new teams to get up to the same level
              of quality * It''s not self-sovereign because if even the most technical
              people can''t inspect and understand the thing, it''s not fully yours
              It''s also less secure, because each part of the protocol, especially
              if it can interact with other parts in complicated ways, carries a risk
              of the protocol breaking. One of my fears with Ethereum protocol development
              is that we can be too eager to add new features to meet highly specific
              needs, even if those features bloat the protocol or add entire new types
              of interacting components or complicated cryptography as critical dependencies.
              This can be nice for short-term functionality gains, but it is highly
              destructive to preserving long-term self-sovereignty, and creating a
              hundred-year decentralized hyperstructure that transcends the rise and
              fall of empires and ideologies. The core problem is that if protocol
              changes are judged from the perspective of "how big are they as changes
              to the existing protocol", then the desire to preserve backwards compatibility
              means that additions happen much more often than subtractions, and the
              protocol inevitably bloats over time. To counteract this, the Ethereum
              development process needs an explicit "simplification" / "garbage collection"
              function. "Simplification" has three metrics: * Minimizing total lines
              of code in the protocol. An ideal protocol fits onto a single page -
              or at least a few pages * Avoiding unnecessary dependencies on fundamentally
              complex technical components. For example, a protocol whose security
              solely depends on hashes (even better: on exactly one hash function)
              is better than one that depends on hashes and lattices. Throwing in
              isogenies is worst of all, because (sorry to the truly brilliant hardworking
              nerds who figured that stuff out) nobody understands isogenies. * Adding
              more _invariants_: core properties that the protocol can rely on, for
              example EIP-6780 (selfdestruct removal) added the property that at most
              N storage slots can be changedakem per slot, significantly simplifying
              client development, and EIP-7825 (per-tx gas cap) added a maximum on
              the cost of processing one transaction, which greatly helps ZK-EVMs
              and parallel execution. Garbage collection can be piecemeal, or it can
              be large-scale. The piecemeal approach tries to take existing features,
              and streamline them so that they are simpler and make more sense. One
              example is the gas cost reforms in Glamsterdam, which make many gas
              costs that were previously arbitrary, instead depend on a small number
              of parameters that are clearly tied to resource consumption. One large-scale
              garbage collection was replacing PoW with PoS. Another is likely to
              happen as part of Lean consensus, opening the room to fix a large number
              of mistakes at the same time ( ). Another approach is "Rosetta-style
              backwards compatibility", where features that are complex but little-used
              remain usable but are "demoted" from being part of the mandatory protocol
              and instead become smart contract code, so new client developers do
              not need to bother with them. Examples: * After we upgrade to full native
              account abstraction, all old tx types can be retired, and EOAs can be
              converted into smart contract wallets whose code can process all of
              those transaction types * We can replace existing precompiles (except
              those that are _really_ needed) with EVM or later RISC-V code * We can
              eventually change the VM from EVM to RISC-V (or other simpler VM); EVM
              could be turned into a smart contract in the new VM. Finally, we want
              to move away from client developers feeling the need to handle all older
              versions of the Ethereum protocol. That can be left to older client
              versions running in docker containers. In the long term, I hope that
              the rate of change to Ethereum can be slower. I think for various reasons
              that ultimately that _must_ happen. These first fifteen years should
              in part be viewed as an adolescence stage where we explored a lot of
              ideas and saw what works and what is useful and what is not. We should
              strive to avoid the parts that are not useful being a permanent drag
              on the Ethereum protocol. Basically, we want to improve Ethereum in
              a way that looks like this:'

            text: '2026 is the year that we take back lost ground in terms of self-sovereignty
              and trustlessness. Some of what this practically means: Full nodes:
              thanks to ZK-EVM and BAL, it will once again become easier to locally
              run a node and verify the Ethereum chain on your own computer. Helios:
              actually verify the data you''re receiving from RPCs instead of blindly
              trusting it. ORAM, PIR: ask for data from RPCs without revealing which
              data you''re asking, so you can access dapps without your access patterns
              being sold off to dozens of third parties all around the world. Social
              recovery wallets and timelocks: wallets that don''t make you lose all
              your money if you misplace your seedphrase, or if an online or offline
              attacker extracts your seedphrase, and *also* don''t make all your money
              backdoored by Google. Privacy UX: make private payments from your wallet,
              with the same user experience as making public payments. Privacy censorship
              resistance: private payments with the ERC-4337 mempool, and soon native
              AA + FOCIL, without relying on the public broadcaster ecosystem. Application
              UIs: use more dapps from an onchain UI with IPFS, without relying on
              trusted servers that would lock you our of practical recovery of your
              assets if they went offline, and would give you a hijacked UI that steals
              your funds if they get hacked for even a millisecond. In many of these
              areas, over the last ten years we have seen serious backsliding in Ethereum.
              Nodes went from easy to run to hard to run. Dapps went from static pages
              to complicated behemoths that leak all your data to a dozen servers.
              Wallets went from routing everything through the RPC, which could be
              any node of your choice including on your own computer, to leaking your
              data to a dozen servers of their choice. Block building became more
              centralized, putting Ethereum transaction inclusion guarantees under
              the whims of a very small number of builders. In 2026, no longer. Every
              compromise of values that Ethereum has made up to this point - every
              moment where you might have been thinking, is it really worth diluting
              ourselves so much in the name of mainstream adoption - we are making
              that compromise no longer. It will be a long road. We will not get everything
              we want in the next Kohaku release, or the next hard fork, or the hard
              fork after that. But it will make Ethereum into an ecosystem that deserves
              not only its current place in the universe, but a much greater one.
              In the world computer, there is no centralized overlord. There is no
              single point of failure. There is only love. Milady.'

            text: 'In 2014, there was a vision: you can have permissionless, decentralized
              applications that could support finance, social media, ride sharing,
              governing organizations, crowdfunding, potentially create an entire
              alternative web, all on the backs of a suite of technologies. Ethereum:
              the blockchain. The world computer that could give any application its
              shared memory. Whisper: the data layer. Messages too expensive for a
              blockchain, that do no need consensus. Swarm: the storage layer. Store
              files for long-term access. Over the last five years, this core vision
              has at times become obscured, with various "metas" and "narratives"
              at various times taking center stage. But the core vision has never
              died. And in fact, the core technologies behind it are only growing
              stronger. Ethereum is now proof of stake. Ethereum is now scaling, it
              is now cheap, and it is on track to get more scalable and cheaper thanks
              to the power of ZK-EVMs. Thanks to ZK-EVM + PeerDAS, the "sharding"
              vision is effectively being realized. And L2s can give additional and
              different kinds of gains in speed on top. Whisper is now Waku ( ), and
              already powers many applications (eg. just to name two I use). Even
              outside of Waku, the quality of decentralized messaging has increased.
              Fileverse (decentralized Google Docs and Sheets alternative: ) has seen
              massive gains in usability over the past year. IPFS is now highly performant
              and robust as a decentralized way of retrieving files, though IPFS alone
              does not solve the storage problem. Hence, there is still room to improve
              there. All of the prerequisites for the original web3 vision are here,
              in full force, and are continuing to get stronger over the next few
              years. Hence, it''s time to buidl, and buidl decentralized. Fileverse
              is an excellent example of the right way to do things: * It uses Ethereum
              and Gnosis Chain for what they are good for: names, accounts and permissioning,
              document registration * It uses decentralized messaging and file storage
              to store documents and propagate changes to documents * The application
              passes the walkaway test: (even if Fileverse disappears, you can still
              retrieve them and even keep editing them with the open source UI) This
              is what we mean by "build a hammer that is a tool you buy once and it''s
              yours, not a corposlop AI dishwasher that requires you to register for
              a google account and charges a subscription fee per month for extra
              washing modes, and probably spies on you and stops working if you get
              politically disfavored by a foreign country". If you think this criticism
              of corposlop is hyperbolic, well turns out, it''s literally a concatenation
              of these three: * * * In 2014, decentralized applications were toys,
              hundreds of times more difficult to use in web2. In 2026, fileverse
              is now usable enough that I regularly write documents in it and send
              them to other people to collaborate. The decentralized renaissance is
              coming, and you can be part of making it happen.'

            text: 'Ethereum itself must pass the walkaway test. Ethereum is meant
              to be a home for trustless and trust-minimized applications, whether
              in finance, governance or elsewhere. It must support applications that
              are more like tools - the hammer that once you buy it''s yours - than
              like services that lose all functionality once the vendor loses interest
              in maintaining them (or worse, gets hacked or becomes value-extractive).
              Even when applications do have functionality that depends on a vendor,
              Ethereum can help reduce those dependencies as much as possible, and
              protect the user as much as possible in those cases where the dependencies
              fail. But building such applications is not possible on a base layer
              which itself depends on ongoing updates from a vendor in order to continue
              being usable - even if that "vendor" is the all core devs process. Ethereum
              the blockchain must have the traits that we strive for in Ethereum''s
              applications. Hence, Ethereum itself must pass the walkaway test. This
              means that Ethereum must get to a place where we _can ossify if we want
              to_. We do not have to stop making changes to the protocol, but we must
              get to a place where Ethereum''s value proposition does not strictly
              depend on any features that are not in the protocol already. This includes
              the following: * Full quantum-resistance. We should resist the trap
              of saying "let''s delay quantum-resistance until the last possible moment
              in the name of ekeing out more efficiencies for a while longer". Individual
              users have that right, but the protocol should not. Being able to say
              "Ethereum''s protocol, as it stands today, is cryptographically safe
              for a hundred years" is something we should strive to get to as soon
              as possible, and insist on as a point of pride. * An architecture that
              can expand to sufficient scalability. The protocol needs to have the
              properties that allow it to expand to many thousands of TPS over time,
              most notably ZK-EVM validation and data sampling through PeerDAS. Ideally,
              we get to a point where further scaling is done through "parameter only"
              changes - and ideally _those_ changes are not BPO-style forks, but rather
              are made with the same validator voting mechanism we use for the gas
              limit. * A state architecture that can last decades. This means deciding,
              and implementing, whatever form of partial statelessness and state expiry
              will let us feel comfortable letting Ethereum run with thousands of
              TPS for decades, without breaking sync or hard disk or I/O requirements.
              It also means future-proofing the tree and storage types to work well
              with this long-term environment. * An account model that is general-purpose
              (this is "full account abstraction": move away from enshrined ECDSA
              for signature validation) * A gas schedule that we are confident is
              free of DoS vulnerabilities, both for execution and for ZK-proving *
              A PoS economic model that, with all we have learned over the past half
              decade of proof of stake in Ethereum and full decade beyond, we are
              confident can last and remain decentralized for decades, and supports
              the usefulness of ETH as trustless collateral (eg. in governance-minimized
              ETH-backed stablecoins) * A block building model that we are confident
              will resist centralization pressure and guarantee censorship resistance
              even in unknown future environments Ideally, we do the hard work over
              the next few years, to get to a point where in the future almost all
              future innovation can happen through client optimization, and get reflected
              in the protocol through parameter changes. Every year, we should tick
              off at least one of these boxes, and ideally multiple. Do the right
              thing once, based on knowledge of what is truly the right thing (and
              not compromise halfway fixes), and maximize Ethereum''s technological
              and social robustness for the long term. Ethereum goes hard. This is
              the gwei.'

              calls "the open web" (really, the corposlop web), and "the sovereign
              web". This is a distinction I did not realize until recently, and I
              must admit the bitcoin maximalists were far ahead: a big part of their
              resistance to ICOs, tokens other than bitcoin, arbitrary financial applications,
              etc was precisely about keeping bitcoin "sovereign" and not "corposlop".
              The big error that many of them made was trying to achieve this goal
              with either government crackdowns or user disempowerment (keeping bitcoin
              script limited, and rejecting many categories of applications entirely),
              but their fear was real. So what is corposlop? In essence, it is the
              combination of three things: * Corporate optimization power * An aura
              of respectableness of being a company with sleek polished branding *
              Behavior that the exact opposite of respectable, because that''s what''s
              needed to maximize profit Corposlop includes things like: * Social media
              that maximizes dopamine, outrage, other methods of short-term engagement,
              at the expense of long-term value and fulfillment * Needless mass data
              collection from users, often followed by managing it carelessly or even
              casually selling it to third parties * Walled gardens charging monopolistic
              high fees and actively preventing people from even linking to other
              platforms * Hollywood releasing the 7th sequel to some tired franchise,
              because that''s the most risk-averse thing to do * Every corporation
              that rallied around slogans of diversity and equity and the need to
              overturn society to fight racism in 2020, and then publicly mocked those
              causes for engagement in 2025 This is all digital corposlop; there are
              big and important analogues to this in the physical world too. Corposlop
              is soulless: trend-following homogeneity that is both evil and lame
              These are things that appear to serve the user, but actually disempower
              the user. I have many qualms with Apple, but aside from their monopolistic
              practices, they actually have many non-corposlop traits. They serve
              users not by constantly asking "what do users want this quarter", but
              by having an opinionated long-term vision. They have a strong emphasis
              on privacy. They resist and create trends rather than following them.
              I just wish they could take the brave step of ending their monopolistic
              practices and switch to an open source first strategy. It may damage
              their market cap, but man must live for something higher than market
              caps. Zac from Aztec was also early to recognize the importance of this,
              with a post that is on the whole very pro-freedom, but at the same time
              does not shrink back from labeling what is essentially corposlop a primary
              enemy, even when it does not violate the libertarian non-aggression
              principle. In 2000, the understanding of "sovereignty" largely focused
              on avoiding the iron fist of government. Today, "sovereignty" also means
              securing your digital privacy through cryptography, and securing your
              own mind from corporate mind warfare trying to extract your attention
              and your dollars. It also means doing things because you believe in
              them, and declaring independence from the homogenizing and soul-sucking
              concept of "the meta". These are the kinds of tools that we should build
              more of. Build tools like: * Privacy-preserving local-first applications
              that minimize dependence on and data leaks to third parties * Social
              media platforms and tools that let the user take control of what content
              they see. Appeal to people''s long-term goals, not short-term impulses
              * Financial tools that help users grow their wealth, and do not encourage
              50x leverage or sports betting or taking out a loan to pay for a burrito
              * AI tools that are maximally open and privacy and local-friendly, and
              that maximize productivity from merging the power of human and bot,
              rather than encouraging the user to sit back and let the bot do all
              the work, so they learn nothing * Applications, companies, and physical
              environments that take an opinionated view on the kind of world they
              want to see, and have an opinionated culture * DAOs that can support
              organizations and communities that steadfastly pursue a unique objective,
              and do not all get captured by the same groups. Privacy-preserving and
              non-tokenholder-driven voting can help here Be sovereign. Reject corposlop.

            text: 'Increasing bandwidth is safer than reducing latency With PeerDAS
              and ZKPs, we know how to scale, and potentially we can scale thousands
              of times compared to the status quo. The numbers become far more favorable
              than before (eg. see analysis here, pre and post-sharding ). There is
              no law of physics that prevents combining extreme scale with decentralization.
              Reducing latency is not like this. We are fundamentally constrained
              by speed of light, and on top of that we are also constrained by: *
              Need to support nodes (especially attesters) in rural environments,
              worldwide, and in home or commercial environments outside of data centers.
              * Need to support censorship-resistance and anonymity for nodes (especially
              proposers and attesters). * The fact that running a node in a non-super-concentrated
              location must be not only possible, but also economically viable. If
              staking outside NYC drops your revenues by 10%, over time more and more
              people will stake in NYC. Ethereum itself must pass the walkaway test,
              and so we cannot build a blockchain that depends on constant social
              re-juggling to ensure decentralization. Economics cannot handle the
              entire load, but it must handle most. Now, we can decrease latency quite
              a bit from the present-day situation without making tradeoffs. In particular:
              * P2P improvements (esp erasure coding) can decrease message propagation
              times without requiring individual nodes to have lower bandwidth * An
              available chain with a smaller node count per slot (eg. 512 instead
              of 30,000) can remove the need for an aggregation step, allowing the
              entire hot path to happen in one subnet This plausibly buys us 3-6x.
              Hence, I think moderate latency decreases, to a 2-4s level, are very
              much in the realm of possibility. But Ethereum is NOT the world video
              game server, it is the world heartbeat. If you need to build applications
              that are faster than the heartbeat, they will need to have offchain
              components. This is a big part of why L2s will continue to have a role
              even in a greatly scaled Ethereum (there are other reasons too, around
              VM customization, and around applications that need _even more scale_).
              Ultimately, AI will necessitate applications that go faster than the
              heartbeat no matter what we do. If an AI can think 1000x faster than
              humans, then to the AI, the "subjective speed of light" is only 300
              km/s. Hence, it can talk near-instantly within the scope of a city,
              but not further. As a result, there will inevitably be AI-focused applications
              that will need "city chains", potentially even chains localized to a
              single building. These will have to be L2s. And on the flipside, it
              would be too much of a cost to make it viable to run a staking node
              on Mars. Even Bitcoin does not strive for this. Ultimately, Ethereum
              belongs to Terra, and its L2s will serve both hyper-localized needs
              in its cities, and hyper-scaled needs planet-wide, and users on other
              worlds. Milady.'

              the same thing but with consensus. Another metaphor for Ethereum is
              Linux. * Linux is free and open source software, and does not compromise
              on this * Linux is quietly depended on by billions of people and enterprises
              worldwide. Governments regularly use it. * There are many operating
              systems based on Linux that pursue mass adoption * There are Linux distributions
              (eg. Arch) that are highly purist, minimalistic and technologically
              beautiful, and focus on making the user feel powerful, not comfortable
              (Actually, BitTorrent is depended on by enterprises too: many businesses
              and even governments (!!) use it to distribute large files to their
              users ) We must make sure that Ethereum L1 works as the financial (and
              ultimately identity, social, governance...) home for individuals and
              organizations who want the higher level of autonomy, and give them access
              to the full power of the network without dependence on intermediaries.
              At the same time, what Linux shows is that this is fully compatible
              with providing value to very large numbers of people, and even being
              loved and trusted by enterprises worldwide. Many enterprises in fact
              desperately want to build on an open and resilient ecosystem - what
              we call trustlessness, they call prudent counterparty risk minimization.
              This is the gwei.'

            text: “Ethereum was not created to make finance efficient or apps convenient.
              It was created to set people free” This was an important - and controversial
              - line from the Trustless Manifesto ( ), and it is worth revisiting
              it and better understanding what it means. “efficient” and “convenient”
              have the connotation of improving the average case, in situations where
              it’s already pretty good. Efficiency is about telling the world's best
              engineers to put their souls into reducing latency from 473 ms to 368ms,
              or increasing yields from 4.5% APY to 5.3% APY. Convenience is about
              people making one click instead of three, and reducing signup times
              from 1 min to 20 sec. These things can be good to do. But we must do
              them under the understanding that we will never be as good at this game
              as the Silicon Valley corporate players. And so the primary underlying
              game that Ethereum plays must be a different game. What is the game?
              Resilience. Resilience is the game where it’s not about 4.5% APY vs
              5.3% APY - rather, it’s about minimizing the chance that you get -100%
              APY. Resilience is the game where if you become politically unpopular
              and get deplatformed, or if a the developers of your application go
              bankrupt or disappear, or if Cloudflare goes down, or if an internet
              cyberwar breaks out, your 2000ms latency continues to be 2000ms. Resilience
              is the game where anyone, anywhere in the world will be able to access
              the network and be a first-class participant. Resilience is sovereignty.
              Not sovereignty in the sense of lobbying to become a UN member state
              and shaking hands at Davos in two weeks, but sovereignty in the sense
              that people talk about "digital sovereignty" or "food sovereignty" -
              aggressively reducing your vulnerabilities to external dependencies
              that can be taken away from you on a whim. This is the sense in which
              the world computer can be sovereign, and in doing so make its users
              also sovereign. This baseline is what enables interdependence as equals,
              and not as vassals of corporate overlords thousands of kilometers away.
              This is the game that Ethereum is suited to win, and it delivers a type
              of value that, in our increasingly unstable world, a lot of people are
              going to need. The fundamental DNA of web2 consumer tech is not suited
              to resilience. The fundamental DNA of _finance_ often spends considerable
              effort on resilience, but it is a very partial form of resilience, good
              at solving for some types of risks but not others. Blockspace is abundant.
              Decentralized, permissionless and resilient blockspace is not. Ethereum
              must first and foremost be decentralized, permissionless and resilient
              block space - and then make that abundant.

            text: 'Now that ZKEVMs are at alpha stage (production-quality performance,
              remaining work is safety) and PeerDAS is live on mainnet, it''s time
              to talk more about what this combination means for Ethereum. These are
              not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally
              new and more powerful kind of decentralized network. To see why, let''s
              look at the two major types of p2p network so far: BitTorrent (2000):
              huge total bandwidth, highly decentralized, no consensus Bitcoin (2009):
              highly decentralized, consensus, but low bandwidth - because it’s not
              “distributed” in the sense of work being split up, it’s *replicated*
              Now, Ethereum with PeerDAS (2025) and ZK-EVMs (expect small portions
              of the network using it in 2026), we get: decentralized, consensus and
              high bandwidth The trilemma has been solved - not on paper, but with
              live running code, of which one half (data availability sampling) is
              *on mainnet today*, and the other half (ZK-EVMs) is *production-quality
              on performance today* - safety is what remains. This was a 10-year journey
              (see the first commit of my original post on DAS here: , and ZK-EVM
              attempts started in ~2020), but it''s finally here. Over the next ~4
              years, expect to see the full extent of this vision roll out: * In 2026,
              large non-ZKEVM-dependent gas limit increases due to BALs and ePBS,
              and we''ll see the first opportunities to run a ZKEVM node * In 2026-28,
              gas repricings, changes to state structure, exec payload going into
              blobs, and other adjustments to make higher gas limits safe * In 2027-30,
              large further gas limit increases, as ZKEVM becomes the primary way
              to validate blocks on the network A third piece of this is distributed
              block building. A long-term ideal holy grail is to get to a future where
              the full block is *never* constituted in one single place. This will
              not be necessary for a long time, but IMO it is worth striving for us
              at least have the capability to do that. Even before that point, we
              want the meaningful authority in block building to be as distributed
              as possible. This can be done either in-protocol (eg. maybe we figure
              out how to expand FOCIL to make it a primary channel for txs), or out-of-protocol
              with distributed builder marketplaces. This reduces risk of centralized
              interference with real-time transaction inclusion, AND it creates a
              better environment for geographical fairness. Onward.'

            text: 'Welcome to 2026! Milady is back. Ethereum did a lot in 2025: gas
              limits increased, blob count increased, node software quality improved,
              zkEVMs blasted through their performance milestones, and with zkEVMs
              and PeerDAS ethereum made its largest step toward being a fundamentally
              new and more powerful kind of blockchain (more on this later) But we
              have a challenge: Ethereum needs to do more to meet its own stated goals.
              Not the quest of "winning the next meta" regardless of whether it''s
              tokenized dollars or political memecoins, not arbitrarily convincing
              people to help us fill up blockspace to make ETH ultrasound again, but
              the mission: To build the world computer that serves as a central infrastructure
              piece of a more free and open internet. We''re building decentralized
              applications. Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party
              interference. Applications that pass the walkaway test: they keep running
              even if the original developers disappear. Applications where if you''re
              a user, you don''t even notice if Cloudflare goes down - or even if
              all of Cloudflare gets hacked by North Korea. Applications whose stability
              transcends the rise and fall of companies, ideologies and political
              parties. And applications that protect your privacy. All this - for
              finance, and also for identity, governance and whatever other civilizational
              infrastructure people want to build. These properties sound radical,
              but we must remember that a generation ago any wallet, kitchen appliance,
              book or car would fulfill every single one of them. Today, all of the
              above are by default becoming subscription services, consigning you
              to permanent dependence on some centralized overlord. Ethereum is the
              rebellion against this. To achieve this, it needs to be (i) usable,
              and usable at scale, and (ii) actually decentralized. This needs to
              happen at both (a) the blockchain layer, including the software we use
              to run and talk to the blockchain, and (b) the application layer. All
              of these pieces must be improved - they are already being improved,
              but they must be improved more. Fortunately, we have powerful tools
              on our side - but we need to apply them, and we will. Wishing everyone
              an exciting 2026. Milady.'

            text: One of the reasons why I'm enthusiastic about @devanshmehta deep
              funding work is that I think it's a big tragedy we've pushed so much
              into cloud-based software and not done enough local-first, including
              in gaming, and it's clear that "it's easy to pirate local-first but
              you can't pirate the cloud" is a major reason why. If we had back in
              2000 figured out some regime where sales tax on electronic devices gets
              routed into automated funding for open source software in proportion
              to how much people benefit and use it, I wonder if that whole tragedy
              could have been avoided.

            text: I have thought for a while that if anyone wants to spin up yet another
              "new AI lab because the existing ones are not good for humanity", they
              should have an explicit binding charter to focus on human-augmentation
              tools and not build anything with > 1 min time horizon autonomy *Even
              if* all the arguments about safety end up wrong, ASI companies pursuing
              Maximum Autonomy Now are a dime a dozen, the human augmentation niche
              ("don't build skynet, build mecha suits for the mind") is underserved.
              Also pls make it open source as much as possible.

        that is doing everything possible to destroy our Country, but are failing
        badly. We no longer have Open Borders, Men in Women’s Sports, Transgender
        for Everyone, or Weak Law Enforcement. What we do have is a Record Stock Market

        a 4.3 GDP, two points better than expected. Tariffs have given us Trillions
        of Dollars in Growth and Prosperity, and the strongest National Security we
        have ever had. We are respected again, perhaps like never before. God Bless
        America!!! President DJT"

        the Board, and just about everybody else in America, I am hosting the event.
        Tell me what you think of my “Master of Ceremony” abilities. If really good,
        would you like me to leave the Presidency in order to make “hosting” a full

        Sylvester Stallone, Michael Crawford, KISS, George Strait, and Gloria Gaynor."

        J. TRUMP"

        *   **2025-11-28:** "The United States did not attend the G20 in South Africa,
        because the South African Government refuses to acknowledge or address the
        horrific Human Right Abuses endured by Afrikaners, and other descendants of
        Dutch, French, and German settlers. To put it more bluntly, they are killing
        white people, and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them. Perhaps,
        worst of all, the soon to be out of business New York Times and the Fake News
        Media won’t issue a word against this genocide. That’s why all the Liars and
        Pretenders of the Radical Left Media are going out of business! At the conclusion
        of the G20, South Africa refused to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior
        Representative from our U.S. Embassy, who attended the Closing Ceremony. Therefore,
        at my direction, South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026
        G20, which will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year. South
        Africa has demonstrated to the World they are not a country worthy of Membership
        anywhere, and we are going to stop all payments and subsidies to them, effective
        immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"

        *   **2025-11-28:** "Democracy is on trial in the coming Elections in the
        beautiful country of Honduras on November 30th. Will Maduro and his Narcoterrorists
        take over another country like they have taken over Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela?
        The man who is standing up for Democracy, and fighting against Maduro, is
        Tito Asfura, the Presidential Candidate of the National Party. Tito was the
        highly successful Mayor of Tegucigalpa where he brought running water to millions,
        and paved hundreds of kilometers of roads. His chief opponent is Rixi Moncada,
        who says Fidel Castro is her idol. Normally, the smart people of Honduras,
        would reject her, and elect Tito Asfura, but the Communists are trying to
        trick the people by running a third Candidate, Salvador Nasralla. Nasralla
        is no friend of Freedom. A borderline Communist, he helped Xiomara Castro
        by running as her Vice President. He won, and helped Castro win. Then he resigned,
        and is now pretending to be an anti-Communist only for the purposes of splitting
        Asfura’s vote. The people of Honduras must not be tricked again. The only
        real friend of Freedom in Honduras is Tito Asfura. Tito and I can work together
        to fight the Narcocommunists, and bring needed aid to the people of Honduras.
        I cannot work with Moncada and the Communists, and Nasralla is not a reliable
        partner for Freedom, and cannot be trusted. I hope the people of Honduras
        vote for Freedom and Democracy, and elect Tito Asfura, President!"

        *   **2025-11-28:** "A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great
        American Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country
        to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed
        at, along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World, for being
        “Politically Correct,” and just plain STUPID, when it comes to Immigration.
        The official United States Foreign population stands at 53 million people
        (Census), most of which are on welfare, from failed nations, or from prisons,
        mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels. They and their children are supported
        through massive payments from Patriotic American Citizens who, because of
        their beautiful hearts, do not want to openly complain or cause trouble in
        any way, shape, or form. They put up with what has happened to our Country,
        but it’s eating them alive to do so! A migrant earning $30,000 with a green
        card will get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family. The real
        migrant population is much higher. This refugee burden is the leading cause
        of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after World
        War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals, housing
        shortages, and large deficits, etc.). As an example, hundreds of thousands
        of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the once great State of
        Minnesota. Somalian gangs are roving the streets looking for “prey” as our
        wonderful people stay locked in their apartments and houses hoping against
        hope that they will be left alone. The seriously retarded Governor of Minnesota,
        Tim Walz, does nothing, either through fear, incompetence, or both, while
        the worst “Congressman/woman” in our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in
        her swaddling hijab, and who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that
        you are not allowed to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain
        about our Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated, when
        her place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which
        is essentially not even a country for lack of Government, Military, Police,
        schools, etc. Even as we have progressed technologically, Immigration Policy
        has eroded those gains and living conditions for many. I will permanently
        pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow the U.S. system to
        fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden illegal admissions,
        including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen, and remove anyone who
        is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country,
        end all Federal benefits and subsidies to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize
        migrants who undermine domestic tranquility, and deport any Foreign National
        who is a public charge, security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization.
        These goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in
        illegal and disruptive populations, including those admitted through an unauthorized
        and illegal Autopen approval process. Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure
        this situation. Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except those that
        hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America stands for — You
        won’t be here for long!"

            text: Merry Christmas to all, including the Radical Left Scum that is
              doing everything possible to destroy our Country, but are failing badly.
              We no longer have Open Borders, Men in Women’s Sports, Transgender for
              Everyone, or Weak Law Enforcement. What we do have is a Record Stock
              Market and 401K’s, Lowest Crime numbers in decades, No Inflation, and
              yesterday, a 4.3 GDP, two points better than expected. Tariffs have
              given us Trillions of Dollars in Growth and Prosperity, and the strongest
              National Security we have ever had. We are respected again, perhaps
              like never before. God Bless America!!! President DJT

            text: The United States did not attend the G20 in South Africa, because
              the South African Government refuses to acknowledge or address the horrific
              Human Right Abuses endured by Afrikaners, and other descendants of Dutch,
              French, and German settlers. To put it more bluntly, they are killing
              white people, and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them.
              Perhaps, worst of all, the soon to be out of business New York Times
              and the Fake News Media won’t issue a word against this genocide. That’s
              why all the Liars and Pretenders of the Radical Left Media are going
              out of business! At the conclusion of the G20, South Africa refused
              to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from our U.S.
              Embassy, who attended the Closing Ceremony. Therefore, at my direction,
              South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which
              will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year. South
              Africa has demonstrated to the World they are not a country worthy of
              Membership anywhere, and we are going to stop all payments and subsidies
              to them, effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this
              matter!

            text: Democracy is on trial in the coming Elections in the beautiful country
              of Honduras on November 30th. Will Maduro and his Narcoterrorists take
              over another country like they have taken over Cuba, Nicaragua, and
              Venezuela? The man who is standing up for Democracy, and fighting against
              Maduro, is Tito Asfura, the Presidential Candidate of the National Party.
              Tito was the highly successful Mayor of Tegucigalpa where he brought
              running water to millions, and paved hundreds of kilometers of roads.
              His chief opponent is Rixi Moncada, who says Fidel Castro is her idol.
              Normally, the smart people of Honduras, would reject her, and elect
              Tito Asfura, but the Communists are trying to trick the people by running
              a third Candidate, Salvador Nasralla. Nasralla is no friend of Freedom.
              A borderline Communist, he helped Xiomara Castro by running as her Vice
              President. He won, and helped Castro win. Then he resigned, and is now
              pretending to be an anti-Communist only for the purposes of splitting
              Asfura’s vote. The people of Honduras must not be tricked again. The
              only real friend of Freedom in Honduras is Tito Asfura. Tito and I can
              work together to fight the Narcocommunists, and bring needed aid to
              the people of Honduras. I cannot work with Moncada and the Communists,
              and Nasralla is not a reliable partner for Freedom, and cannot be trusted.
              I hope the people of Honduras vote for Freedom and Democracy, and elect
              Tito Asfura, President!

            text: A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great American
              Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country
              to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed
              at, along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World,
              for being “Politically Correct,” and just plain STUPID, when it comes
              to Immigration. The official United States Foreign population stands
              at 53 million people (Census), most of which are on welfare, from failed
              nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.
              They and their children are supported through massive payments from
              Patriotic American Citizens who, because of their beautiful hearts,
              do not want to openly complain or cause trouble in any way, shape, or
              form. They put up with what has happened to our Country, but it’s eating
              them alive to do so! A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will
              get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family. The real migrant
              population is much higher. This refugee burden is the leading cause
              of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after
              World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals,
              housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.). As an example, hundreds
              of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the
              once great State of Minnesota. Somalian gangs are roving the streets
              looking for “prey” as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments
              and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone. The seriously
              retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through
              fear, incompetence, or both, while the worst “Congressman/woman” in
              our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and
              who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that you are not allowed
              to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our
              Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated, when her
              place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which
              is essentially not even a country for lack of Government, Military,
              Police, schools, etc. Even as we have progressed technologically, Immigration
              Policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many. I will
              permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow
              the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden
              illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen,
              and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is
              incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies
              to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic
              tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge,
              security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization. These goals
              will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal
              and disruptive populations, including those admitted through an unauthorized
              and illegal Autopen approval process. Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully
              cure this situation. Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except
              those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America
              stands for — You won’t be here for long!

              doing everything possible to destroy our Country, but are failing badly.
              We no longer have Open Borders, Men in Women’s Sports, Transgender for
              Everyone, or Weak Law Enforcement. What we do have is a Record Stock
              Market and 401K’s, Lowest Crime numbers in decades, No Inflation, and
              yesterday, a 4.3 GDP, two points better than expected. Tariffs have
              given us Trillions of Dollars in Growth and Prosperity, and the strongest
              National Security we have ever had. We are respected again, perhaps
              like never before. God Bless America!!! President DJT

            text: The United States did not attend the G20 in South Africa, because
              the South African Government refuses to acknowledge or address the horrific
              Human Right Abuses endured by Afrikaners, and other descendants of Dutch,
              French, and German settlers. To put it more bluntly, they are killing
              white people, and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them.
              Perhaps, worst of all, the soon to be out of business New York Times
              and the Fake News Media won’t issue a word against this genocide. That’s
              why all the Liars and Pretenders of the Radical Left Media are going
              out of business! At the conclusion of the G20, South Africa refused
              to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from our U.S.
              Embassy, who attended the Closing Ceremony. Therefore, at my direction,
              South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which
              will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year. South
              Africa has demonstrated to the World they are not a country worthy of
              Membership anywhere, and we are going to stop all payments and subsidies
              to them, effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this
              matter!

            text: Democracy is on trial in the coming Elections in the beautiful country
              of Honduras on November 30th. Will Maduro and his Narcoterrorists take
              over another country like they have taken over Cuba, Nicaragua, and
              Venezuela? The man who is standing up for Democracy, and fighting against
              Maduro, is Tito Asfura, the Presidential Candidate of the National Party.
              Tito was the highly successful Mayor of Tegucigalpa where he brought
              running water to millions, and paved hundreds of kilometers of roads.
              His chief opponent is Rixi Moncada, who says Fidel Castro is her idol.
              Normally, the smart people of Honduras, would reject her, and elect
              Tito Asfura, but the Communists are trying to trick the people by running
              a third Candidate, Salvador Nasralla. Nasralla is no friend of Freedom.
              A borderline Communist, he helped Xiomara Castro by running as her Vice
              President. He won, and helped Castro win. Then he resigned, and is now
              pretending to be an anti-Communist only for the purposes of splitting
              Asfura’s vote. The people of Honduras must not be tricked again. The
              only real friend of Freedom in Honduras is Tito Asfura. Tito and I can
              work together to fight the Narcocommunists, and bring needed aid to
              the people of Honduras. I cannot work with Moncada and the Communists,
              and Nasralla is not a reliable partner for Freedom, and cannot be trusted.
              I hope the people of Honduras vote for Freedom and Democracy, and elect
              Tito Asfura, President!

            text: A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great American
              Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country
              to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed
              at, along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World,
              for being “Politically Correct,” and just plain STUPID, when it comes
              to Immigration. The official United States Foreign population stands
              at 53 million people (Census), most of which are on welfare, from failed
              nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.
              They and their children are supported through massive payments from
              Patriotic American Citizens who, because of their beautiful hearts,
              do not want to openly complain or cause trouble in any way, shape, or
              form. They put up with what has happened to our Country, but it’s eating
              them alive to do so! A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will
              get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family. The real migrant
              population is much higher. This refugee burden is the leading cause
              of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after
              World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals,
              housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.). As an example, hundreds
              of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the
              once great State of Minnesota. Somalian gangs are roving the streets
              looking for “prey” as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments
              and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone. The seriously
              retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through
              fear, incompetence, or both, while the worst “Congressman/woman” in
              our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and
              who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that you are not allowed
              to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our
              Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated, when her
              place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which
              is essentially not even a country for lack of Government, Military,
              Police, schools, etc. Even as we have progressed technologically, Immigration
              Policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many. I will
              permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow
              the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden
              illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen,
              and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is
              incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies
              to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic
              tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge,
              security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization. These goals
              will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal
              and disruptive populations, including those admitted through an unauthorized
              and illegal Autopen approval process. Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully
              cure this situation. Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except
              those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America
              stands for — You won’t be here for long!

            text: 'Ethereum has changed one of its core assumptions. The EIP-7251,
              as part of the Pectra upgrade, removes the rigid 32 ETH validator cap
              and introduces balance-based staking with auto-compounding. What this
              means: • Fewer validators, same security • Lower network overhead and
              better finality resilience • Higher capital efficiency for long-term
              stakers • New tradeoffs around concentration and reward variance We
              break down what changed, who benefits, and the risks that come with
              it 👇'

              — energy, data centers, AI, EVs. And here’s what most miss: Silver isn’t

            text: Gold tells you when trust breaks. Silver tells you what the system
              is still forced to run on. That’s why silver isn’t trading like a metal
              anymore — it’s trading like infrastructure. Gold stores trust. Bitcoin
              stores trust. Silver executes reality. Ethereum executes reality.
