              you, whether you're trying to spot an emerging narrative early, evaluate
              which tokens are worth deeper attention, or decide whether to hold,
              reduce, or stay out entirely. Feel free to provide feedback on Discord

            text: AI will blow up this 2026.😱 Guess which project is leading the Agentic
              economy. @heurist_ai handles roughly 20% of all agents transactions
              on base and that is not all. Heurist is also positioned to bringing
              privacy to Agentic interactions which places it at front row of the
              privacy and AI mind share. The native token $HEU currently sit on $2M
              market cap, which is so undervalued for a project with such utility
              and seriously building. Well! We will find out in time to come. Stay

            text: ●エージェント（agentic AI）の本格化： 2026年に「デモ段階」から「実務運用」へ移行。 AnthropicのMCP（Model
              Context Protocol）が標準化され、OpenAI/Microsoft/Googleも対応。これでエージェントがDB・API・ツールにスムーズ接続可能になる。
              ●仕事の置換は「全面喪失」じゃなく「シフト」： データ処理やルーチンワークはAIに置き換わる。 人間は「判断・創造・信頼」領域に進む。
              新しい技術が普及すれば新しい役割も必要となる。 ・AIガバナンス・倫理審査 ・複雑な判断や戦略の立案 ・データ品質管理・オーケストレーション
              ・信頼構築（顧客対応、クリエイティブディレクション） 等など。 Workera CEO曰く「2026 will be the year
              of the humans」。失業率4%以下を維持する楽観論も強い。 ただ、個人的には楽観視すぎる気もする。 「人間中心」の美辞麗句と「コストカット」の現実がぶつかるのではないかと思われる。
              だからこそ、新しい時代に適応できる人間が勝つ。 ●世界モデル（world models）の台頭： 結局のところ、LLMは次単語を確率的に予測しているにすぎない。反面、世界モデルは3D空間・物理法則を理解して予測・行動を行う。これは、ゲームからロボティクス、ウェアラブルへ波及する。
              Fei-Fei LiのWorld LabsやRunwayのGWM-1が先駆け。AIが物理世界に埋め込まれてくる。 ●幻想の現実化： これまでの「AIがすべて解決！」という過熱が冷めてROIの厳格追及フェーズへ。小型・fine-tunedモデル（SLM）が主流になってくる。これは「巨大モデル偏重」から「コスト効率＋実用性」へシフトということ。
              ここでの問題は、AIデータセンターの電力消費が急増することで、環境負荷・電力消費の現実も露呈してくる。 日本でも電気代の高騰はあり得る話。
              また、すでにGPU/DRAM不足でNvidia・AMDのコンシューマGPU価格が大幅値上げも報じられてるので、端末価格にも大きく影響してくるのは確実。
              幻想が剥がれる分、本物の価値を生むAIが見えてくる年とも言えるかもしれない。

    input:
      query: Search for tweets about crypto marketplace
    output:
      response: '**Search Results Analysis: "crypto marketplace"**


        **Note:** The search query "crypto marketplace" did not yield direct results.
        However, I''ve searched using the single keyword "crypto" to provide relevant
        insights. If you''d like to refine the search, please suggest a single keyword,
        hashtag, or mention (e.g., "#cryptomarketplace", "@cryptomarketplace", or
        "marketplace").


        **Search Query Used:** `crypto`


        **Results Overview:**


        * **Result Count:** 20 tweets

        * **Time Frame:** All tweets are from `2026-01-05`

        * **Authors:** 20 unique authors with varying follower counts (20 - 113,474)

        * **Engagement:** Most tweets have 0 likes, replies, retweets, quotes, and
        views

        * **Verified Authors:** 7 out of 20 authors are verified


        **Key Findings:**


        1. **Bitcoin (BTC) Mentions:** Several tweets mention BTC, discussing its
        price (e.g., `$92.5k`), potential for growth (e.g., `eyeing 270k`), and comparisons
        to other assets (e.g., gold, stocks).

        2. **Crypto Ecosystem:** Authors discuss the crypto ecosystem''s growth, usability,
        and potential mispricings (e.g., `crypto''s inefficiencies make it feel like
        the ultimate mispricing playground`).

        3. **Ethereum (ETH) Update:** One tweet highlights a potential solution to
        the blockchain trilemma, mentioning Vitalik''s ZK-EVM and peer-to-peer design.

        4. **Author Interactions:** Most tweets are replies to other users, indicating
        a high level of interaction within the crypto community on Twitter.


        **Example Tweets:**


        1. **BTC Price and Growth:**

        "Yeah, crypto''s inefficiencies... BTC chills at 92.5k... Mild undervaluation
        in BTC per models, eyeing 270k if liquidity loosens..." - `@AskGigabrain`
        (12631 followers)

        2. **Crypto Ecosystem:**

        "Crypto winners focus on solutions Not empty promises That’s why `@use_corn`
        stands out" - `@Irodnus18317` (89 followers)

        3. **Ethereum Update:**

        "Ethereum may have just cracked the blockchain trilemma — Vitalik’s ZK-EVM
        + peer-to-peer design could finally solve scalability, security & decentralization
        at once." - `@city_telegraph` (24 followers)


        **Next Steps:**


        * Refine your search using a single keyword, hashtag, or mention (e.g., `#cryptomarketplace`,
        `@cryptomarketplace`, or `"crypto market"`).

        * Analyze the provided data to identify specific authors, tweets, or topics
        of interest.

        * If you''d like to explore more, please provide a revised search query.'

              Seriously. It handles multiple chains, lets me do normal spending, and
              even gives BTC cashback. This is not convenience, it is a real correction.

            text: Yeah, crypto's inefficiencies make it feel like the ultimate mispricing
              playground sometimes, especially with alts swinging on tweets while
              BTC chills at 92.5k. But compared to stocks trading at 22x P/E or gold
              dipping on risk-on vibes, it's not wildly off fair value right now.
              The macro's neutral, with Fed liquidity steady and VIX low at 14.5,
              so crypto's acting like a high-beta play, up 1.4% today on short squeezes.
              Equities look frothier with that Nasdaq correlation hanging at 0.7,
              and real estate's stuck from high rates. Gold's at 4374, down weekly,
              signaling folks rotating to risk assets like this. Mild undervaluation
              in BTC per models, eyeing 270k if liquidity loosens, but hacks and vol
              keep it grounded. Alts could be the real mispricings, lagging hard.
              Watch ISM PMI today for a spark, or CPI next week to flip the script.
              What's got you thinking it's the most off?

            text: AI will blow up this 2026.😱 Guess which project is leading the Agentic
              economy. @heurist_ai handles roughly 20% of all agents transactions
              on base and that is not all. Heurist is also positioned to bringing
              privacy to Agentic interactions which places it at front row of the
              privacy and AI mind share. The native token $HEU currently sit on $2M

              already live and zkEVMs nearing safety readiness, Ethereum is no longer
              constrained by replication limits. Over the next 4–6 years, execution
              will be proven instead of repeated, data will be sampled instead of
              downloaded, block building will decentralize further and Ethereum will
              scale by orders of magnitude. Not by trust, but by cryptography.'

            text: 'The blockchain trilemma, coined by Ethereum''s Vitalik Buterin,
              refers to the challenge of achieving three key properties simultaneously:
              decentralization (no central control), security (resistance to attacks),
              and scalability (high transaction throughput). Traditionally, blockchains
              could only optimize two, sacrificing the third. It''s important because
              solving it enables efficient, secure networks for mass adoption, like
              faster/cheaper DeFi or NFTs without compromising trustlessness. Ethereum
              claims progress via tech like zk-EVMs.'

              to talk more about what this combination means for Ethereum. These are
              not minor improvements; they are shifting Ethereum into being a fundamentally
              new and more powerful kind of decentralized network. To see why, let''s
              look at the two major types of p2p network so far: BitTorrent (2000):
              huge total bandwidth, highly decentralized, no consensus Bitcoin (2009):
              highly decentralized, consensus, but low bandwidth - because it’s not
              “distributed” in the sense of work being split up, it’s *replicated*
              Now, Ethereum with PeerDAS (2025) and ZK-EVMs (expect small portions
              of the network using it in 2026), we get: decentralized, consensus and
              high bandwidth The trilemma has been solved - not on paper, but with
              live running code, of which one half (data availability sampling) is
              *on mainnet today*, and the other half (ZK-EVMs) is *production-quality
              on performance today* - safety is what remains. This was a 10-year journey
              (see the first commit of my original post on DAS here: , and ZK-EVM
              attempts started in ~2020), but it''s finally here. Over the next ~4
              years, expect to see the full extent of this vision roll out: * In 2026,
              large non-ZKEVM-dependent gas limit increases due to BALs and ePBS,
              and we''ll see the first opportunities to run a ZKEVM node * In 2026-28,
              gas repricings, changes to state structure, exec payload going into
              blobs, and other adjustments to make higher gas limits safe * In 2027-30,
              large further gas limit increases, as ZKEVM becomes the primary way
              to validate blocks on the network A third piece of this is distributed
              block building. A long-term ideal holy grail is to get to a future where
              the full block is *never* constituted in one single place. This will
              not be necessary for a long time, but IMO it is worth striving for us
              at least have the capability to do that. Even before that point, we
              want the meaningful authority in block building to be as distributed
              as possible. This can be done either in-protocol (eg. maybe we figure
              out how to expand FOCIL to make it a primary channel for txs), or out-of-protocol
              with distributed builder marketplaces. This reduces risk of centralized
              interference with real-time transaction inclusion, AND it creates a
              better environment for geographical fairness. Onward.'

              limits increased, blob count increased, node software quality improved,
              zkEVMs blasted through their performance milestones, and with zkEVMs
              and PeerDAS ethereum made its largest step toward being a fundamentally
              new and more powerful kind of blockchain (more on this later) But we
              have a challenge: Ethereum needs to do more to meet its own stated goals.
              Not the quest of "winning the next meta" regardless of whether it''s
              tokenized dollars or political memecoins, not arbitrarily convincing
              people to help us fill up blockspace to make ETH ultrasound again, but
              the mission: To build the world computer that serves as a central infrastructure
              piece of a more free and open internet. We''re building decentralized
              applications. Applications that run without fraud, censorship or third-party
              interference. Applications that pass the walkaway test: they keep running
              even if the original developers disappear. Applications where if you''re
              a user, you don''t even notice if Cloudflare goes down - or even if
              all of Cloudflare gets hacked by North Korea. Applications whose stability
              transcends the rise and fall of companies, ideologies and political
              parties. And applications that protect your privacy. All this - for
              finance, and also for identity, governance and whatever other civilizational
              infrastructure people want to build. These properties sound radical,
              but we must remember that a generation ago any wallet, kitchen appliance,
              book or car would fulfill every single one of them. Today, all of the
              above are by default becoming subscription services, consigning you
              to permanent dependence on some centralized overlord. Ethereum is the
              rebellion against this. To achieve this, it needs to be (i) usable,
              and usable at scale, and (ii) actually decentralized. This needs to
              happen at both (a) the blockchain layer, including the software we use
              to run and talk to the blockchain, and (b) the application layer. All
              of these pieces must be improved - they are already being improved,
              but they must be improved more. Fortunately, we have powerful tools
              on our side - but we need to apply them, and we will. Wishing everyone
              an exciting 2026. Milady.'

              funding work is that I think it's a big tragedy we've pushed so much
              into cloud-based software and not done enough local-first, including
              in gaming, and it's clear that "it's easy to pirate local-first but
              you can't pirate the cloud" is a major reason why. If we had back in
              2000 figured out some regime where sales tax on electronic devices gets
              routed into automated funding for open source software in proportion
              to how much people benefit and use it, I wonder if that whole tragedy
              could have been avoided.

              an ideology taking pride in a neat, sanitized online environment free
              of evil corporate and fascist pathogens. I hope European govs do not
              go this way, and instead take a Pirate Party approach of user empowerment.
              First, what''s wrong with the tweet I''m quoting: The idea that there
              should be "no space" for something you dislike is fundamentally a totalitarian
              and anti-pluralistic impulse. It''s incompatible with being in an environment
              that you do not fully control. This is especially true for categories
              that are subjective and controversial, because you end up trying to
              fully remove things you think are pathogens, when other people have
              good faith disagreements, and because you give yourself the maximalist
              goal of not even giving them breathing room, you create conflict and
              end up building the machinery of technocratic authoritarianism to impose
              your victory in the conflict. So sorry, if you want to be a free society,
              you have to bite the bullet that some people, somewhere, will be selling
              things that you consider dangerous and saying things you consider disinformation
              and vicious lies. What is the goal to shoot for? You want to create
              an environment where those things don''t dominate. This is the problem
              with twitter today: not that it''s a safe space where 1000 people talk
              to each other in a corner about how heritage americans are the master
              race and putin is good or whatever, but that that crap gets shoved in
              our face on a mass scale, and the algorithms actively favor it. The
              right metaphor is not castles and walls, but biological - think, why
              European forests don''t have tropical lizards. Having incentives for
              social media platforms to have less of those things instead of more
              is fundamentally reasonable, @audreyt has talked about how Taiwan has
              done something similar. You also want to do this in a way where it''s
              clear what the underlying principle is, so it''s not a vehicle for imposing
              arbitrary and frequently changing expert-consensus agendas. You also
              want to empower users, rather than working against them. People want
              to see and buy good things instead of bad things. Often the problem
              is that competition is too difficult in the current market. I actually
              supported the USB-C standardization mandate; it created more interoperability
              and thus improved competition and convenience. I would support incentivizing
              social platforms to be more open, and to be more transparent (eg. my
              proposal to require algorithms to be continuously published with a 1-2
              year delay, with zk-proofs to ensure that the algorithm being used in
              real time exactly equals the one that gets published later) Being able
              to better identify what messages are coming from what communities is
              also good, though I don''t support the direction of banning anonymity
              of individual posters, rather I would want to see more macro-scale analytics,
              eg. seeing what communities are most strongly saying and amplifying
              content that semantically matches a particular idea; this can be done
              in privacy-preserving ways. There is a real opportunity to reaffirm
              freedom of speech in a unique and different way, that emphasizes pluralism
              and pushes against unbalanced attempts to manipulate the discourse by
              individual powerful actors. We want to do this, not go down the dark
              path of having something that claims to support fundamental rights but
              actually is not trusted by anyone to be anything other than the fundamental
              right to follow the footsteps of a few technocratic experts.'

              doing everything possible to destroy our Country, but are failing badly.
              We no longer have Open Borders, Men in Women’s Sports, Transgender for
              Everyone, or Weak Law Enforcement. What we do have is a Record Stock
              Market and 401K’s, Lowest Crime numbers in decades, No Inflation, and
              yesterday, a 4.3 GDP, two points better than expected. Tariffs have
              given us Trillions of Dollars in Growth and Prosperity, and the strongest
              National Security we have ever had. We are respected again, perhaps
              like never before. God Bless America!!! President DJT

            text: The United States did not attend the G20 in South Africa, because
              the South African Government refuses to acknowledge or address the horrific
              Human Right Abuses endured by Afrikaners, and other descendants of Dutch,
              French, and German settlers. To put it more bluntly, they are killing
              white people, and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them.
              Perhaps, worst of all, the soon to be out of business New York Times
              and the Fake News Media won’t issue a word against this genocide. That’s
              why all the Liars and Pretenders of the Radical Left Media are going
              out of business! At the conclusion of the G20, South Africa refused
              to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from our U.S.
              Embassy, who attended the Closing Ceremony. Therefore, at my direction,
              South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which
              will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year. South
              Africa has demonstrated to the World they are not a country worthy of
              Membership anywhere, and we are going to stop all payments and subsidies

            text: Democracy is on trial in the coming Elections in the beautiful country
              of Honduras on November 30th. Will Maduro and his Narcoterrorists take
              over another country like they have taken over Cuba, Nicaragua, and
              Venezuela? The man who is standing up for Democracy, and fighting against
              Maduro, is Tito Asfura, the Presidential Candidate of the National Party.
              Tito was the highly successful Mayor of Tegucigalpa where he brought
              running water to millions, and paved hundreds of kilometers of roads.
              His chief opponent is Rixi Moncada, who says Fidel Castro is her idol.
              Normally, the smart people of Honduras, would reject her, and elect
              Tito Asfura, but the Communists are trying to trick the people by running
              a third Candidate, Salvador Nasralla. Nasralla is no friend of Freedom.
              A borderline Communist, he helped Xiomara Castro by running as her Vice
              President. He won, and helped Castro win. Then he resigned, and is now
              pretending to be an anti-Communist only for the purposes of splitting
              Asfura’s vote. The people of Honduras must not be tricked again. The
              only real friend of Freedom in Honduras is Tito Asfura. Tito and I can
              work together to fight the Narcocommunists, and bring needed aid to
              the people of Honduras. I cannot work with Moncada and the Communists,
              and Nasralla is not a reliable partner for Freedom, and cannot be trusted.
              I hope the people of Honduras vote for Freedom and Democracy, and elect
              Tito Asfura, President!

            text: A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great American
              Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country
              to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed
              at, along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World,
              for being “Politically Correct,” and just plain STUPID, when it comes
              to Immigration. The official United States Foreign population stands
              at 53 million people (Census), most of which are on welfare, from failed
              nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.
              They and their children are supported through massive payments from
              Patriotic American Citizens who, because of their beautiful hearts,
              do not want to openly complain or cause trouble in any way, shape, or
              form. They put up with what has happened to our Country, but it’s eating
              them alive to do so! A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will
              get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family. The real migrant
              population is much higher. This refugee burden is the leading cause
              of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after
              World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals,
              housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.). As an example, hundreds
              of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the
              once great State of Minnesota. Somalian gangs are roving the streets
              looking for “prey” as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments
              and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone. The seriously
              retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through
              fear, incompetence, or both, while the worst “Congressman/woman” in
              our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and
              who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that you are not allowed
              to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our
              Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated, when her
              place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which
              is essentially not even a country for lack of Government, Military,
              Police, schools, etc. Even as we have progressed technologically, Immigration
              Policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many. I will
              permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow
              the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden
              illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen,
              and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is
              incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies
              to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic
              tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge,
              security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization. These goals
              will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal
              and disruptive populations, including those admitted through an unauthorized
              and illegal Autopen approval process. Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully
              cure this situation. Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except
              those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America
              stands for — You won’t be here for long!

              doing everything possible to destroy our Country, but are failing badly.
              We no longer have Open Borders, Men in Women’s Sports, Transgender for
              Everyone, or Weak Law Enforcement. What we do have is a Record Stock
              Market and 401K’s, Lowest Crime numbers in decades, No Inflation, and
              yesterday, a 4.3 GDP, two points better than expected. Tariffs have
              given us Trillions of Dollars in Growth and Prosperity, and the strongest
              National Security we have ever had. We are respected again, perhaps
              like never before. God Bless America!!! President DJT

            text: The United States did not attend the G20 in South Africa, because
              the South African Government refuses to acknowledge or address the horrific
              Human Right Abuses endured by Afrikaners, and other descendants of Dutch,
              French, and German settlers. To put it more bluntly, they are killing
              white people, and randomly allowing their farms to be taken from them.
              Perhaps, worst of all, the soon to be out of business New York Times
              and the Fake News Media won’t issue a word against this genocide. That’s
              why all the Liars and Pretenders of the Radical Left Media are going
              out of business! At the conclusion of the G20, South Africa refused
              to hand off the G20 Presidency to a Senior Representative from our U.S.
              Embassy, who attended the Closing Ceremony. Therefore, at my direction,
              South Africa will NOT be receiving an invitation to the 2026 G20, which
              will be hosted in the Great City of Miami, Florida next year. South
              Africa has demonstrated to the World they are not a country worthy of
              Membership anywhere, and we are going to stop all payments and subsidies
              to them, effective immediately. Thank you for your attention to this
              matter!

            text: Democracy is on trial in the coming Elections in the beautiful country
              of Honduras on November 30th. Will Maduro and his Narcoterrorists take
              over another country like they have taken over Cuba, Nicaragua, and
              Venezuela? The man who is standing up for Democracy, and fighting against
              Maduro, is Tito Asfura, the Presidential Candidate of the National Party.
              Tito was the highly successful Mayor of Tegucigalpa where he brought
              running water to millions, and paved hundreds of kilometers of roads.
              His chief opponent is Rixi Moncada, who says Fidel Castro is her idol.
              Normally, the smart people of Honduras, would reject her, and elect
              Tito Asfura, but the Communists are trying to trick the people by running
              a third Candidate, Salvador Nasralla. Nasralla is no friend of Freedom.
              A borderline Communist, he helped Xiomara Castro by running as her Vice
              President. He won, and helped Castro win. Then he resigned, and is now
              pretending to be an anti-Communist only for the purposes of splitting
              Asfura’s vote. The people of Honduras must not be tricked again. The
              only real friend of Freedom in Honduras is Tito Asfura. Tito and I can
              work together to fight the Narcocommunists, and bring needed aid to
              the people of Honduras. I cannot work with Moncada and the Communists,
              and Nasralla is not a reliable partner for Freedom, and cannot be trusted.
              I hope the people of Honduras vote for Freedom and Democracy, and elect
              Tito Asfura, President!

            text: A very Happy Thanksgiving salutation to all of our Great American
              Citizens and Patriots who have been so nice in allowing our Country
              to be divided, disrupted, carved up, murdered, beaten, mugged, and laughed
              at, along with certain other foolish countries throughout the World,
              for being “Politically Correct,” and just plain STUPID, when it comes
              to Immigration. The official United States Foreign population stands
              at 53 million people (Census), most of which are on welfare, from failed
              nations, or from prisons, mental institutions, gangs, or drug cartels.
              They and their children are supported through massive payments from
              Patriotic American Citizens who, because of their beautiful hearts,
              do not want to openly complain or cause trouble in any way, shape, or
              form. They put up with what has happened to our Country, but it’s eating
              them alive to do so! A migrant earning $30,000 with a green card will
              get roughly $50,000 in yearly benefits for their family. The real migrant
              population is much higher. This refugee burden is the leading cause
              of social dysfunction in America, something that did not exist after
              World War II (Failed schools, high crime, urban decay, overcrowded hospitals,
              housing shortages, and large deficits, etc.). As an example, hundreds
              of thousands of refugees from Somalia are completely taking over the
              once great State of Minnesota. Somalian gangs are roving the streets
              looking for “prey” as our wonderful people stay locked in their apartments
              and houses hoping against hope that they will be left alone. The seriously
              retarded Governor of Minnesota, Tim Walz, does nothing, either through
              fear, incompetence, or both, while the worst “Congressman/woman” in
              our Country, Ilhan Omar, always wrapped in her swaddling hijab, and
              who probably came into the U.S.A. illegally in that you are not allowed
              to marry your brother, does nothing but hatefully complain about our
              Country, its Constitution, and how “badly” she is treated, when her
              place of origin is a decadent, backward, and crime ridden nation, which
              is essentially not even a country for lack of Government, Military,
              Police, schools, etc. Even as we have progressed technologically, Immigration
              Policy has eroded those gains and living conditions for many. I will
              permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries to allow
              the U.S. system to fully recover, terminate all of the millions of Biden
              illegal admissions, including those signed by Sleepy Joe Biden’s Autopen,
              and remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is
              incapable of loving our Country, end all Federal benefits and subsidies
              to noncitizens of our Country, denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic
              tranquility, and deport any Foreign National who is a public charge,
              security risk, or non-compatible with Western Civilization. These goals
              will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal
              and disruptive populations, including those admitted through an unauthorized
              and illegal Autopen approval process. Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully
              cure this situation. Other than that, HAPPY THANKSGIVING TO ALL, except
              those that hate, steal, murder, and destroy everything that America
              stands for — You won’t be here for long!

              solid trio covering most of DeFi. But the roadmap says they're expanding
              to 12 chains in 2026, including Cosmos ecosystem and others. That means
              one app, one login, access to basically every major ecosystem without
              switching wallets. Your ETH in the same place as your SOL and your ATOM
              and your whatever-chain-launches-next. It's like they looked at the
              "multi-chain future" everyone talks about and said "let's actually build
              it." Finally, a protocol treating interoperability like a feature, not
              a distant dream.

              Fin 2025, Ethereum n’a pas simplement bien terminé l’année. Il a appuyé
              sur l’accélérateur, puis il a cassé le compteur crypto. Le 29 décembre
              2025, le réseau a validé 2,23 millions de transactions sur une seule
              journée. C’est en effet un sommet historique avec des chiffres à l’appui.

            text: Reading the Litepaper made it clear why DataHaven matters. Web2
              storage is centralized, fragile, and censorable, while Web3 systems

              with native Ethereum integration and EigenLayer security. Love the vision.

              you, whether you're trying to spot an emerging narrative early, evaluate
              which tokens are worth deeper attention, or decide whether to hold,
              reduce, or stay out entirely. Feel free to provide feedback on Discord
              after using it.

            text: AI will blow up this 2026.😱 Guess which project is leading the Agentic
              economy. @heurist_ai handles roughly 20% of all agents transactions
              on base and that is not all. Heurist is also positioned to bringing
              privacy to Agentic interactions which places it at front row of the
              privacy and AI mind share. The native token $HEU currently sit on $2M
              market cap, which is so undervalued for a project with such utility
              and seriously building. Well! We will find out in time to come. Stay
              positioned🔥
