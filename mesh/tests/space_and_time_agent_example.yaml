      \ network has maintained a remarkably consistent block creation rate, averaging\
      \ approximately **7,153 blocks per day** over the full days observed.\n2. **Highest\
      \ and Lowest Blocks in a Day:** The highest number of blocks created in a single\
      \ day was **7,168** on June 24, and the lowest was **7,036** on June 15.\n3.\
      \ **Partial Day Data (July 11):** The block count of **3,128** for July 11 only\
      \ reflects data up to the time the query was executed and does not represent\
      \ a full day's activity.\n\n**Context for Blockchain Metric:**\n- **Block Creation\
      \ Rate:** A consistent block creation rate is indicative of the network's stability\
      \ and the miners' ability to validate transactions at a steady pace. The average\
      \ block time on Ethereum is targeted to be around 13-15 seconds, which, given\
      \ the numbers, seems to be relatively maintained.\n- **Network Activity:** The\
      \ consistency in block creation could imply a steady transaction volume, though\
      \ this metric alone doesn't account for variations in transaction types or sizes."

      **Time Period:** Not specified in the query (assuming latest available data)

      **Blockchain Network:** HEURIST

      **Metric for Ranking:** LLAMA POINTS (higher values indicate better performance)


      | **Rank** | **MINER_ID** | **LLAMA POINTS** | **WAIFU POINTS** |

      | --- | --- | --- | --- |

      | 1    | `0xbf56...` | **187.8M** | 10.2M |

      | 2    | `0xbf56...` | **165.4M** | 29.6M |

      | 3    | `0xbf56...` | **148.9M** | 66.9M |

      | 4    | `0xbf56...` | **145.6M** | 19.3M |

      | 5    | `0xbf56...` | **128.5M** | 59.5M |

      | 6    | `0xbf56...` | **126.4M** | 12.5M |

      | 7    | `0xbf56...` | **124.1M** | 11.9M |

      | 8    | `0xbf56...` | **120.9M** | 23.9M |

      | 9    | `0xbf56...` | **110.1M** | 49.9M |

      | 10   | `0xbf56...` | **108.3M** | 74.4M |


      **Observations and Insights:**


      1. **Dominant Miner:** All top 10 GPUs are associated with the same `MINER_ID`
      (`0xbf56a3e7b4a6f95a08e255bd28d806033b98c9c8`), indicating a significant concentration
      of high-performance GPUs under a single miner''s control.

      2. **Performance Range:** The top GPU outperforms the tenth by approximately
      **73.5M LLAMA POINTS**, showing a considerable gap in performance among the
      top-tier GPUs.

      3. **WAIFU POINTS Variability:** There''s a noticeable variability in WAIFU
      POINTS across the top GPUs, with the highest being **74.4M** (Rank 10) and the
      lowest being **10.2M** (Rank 1). This suggests that WAIFU POINTS do not linearly
      correlate with LLAMA POINTS in this dataset.

      4. **No Diversification:** The lack of diversity in MINER_IDs among the top
      performers might indicate a centralized mining operation or a dominant player
      in the HEURIST network, which could have implications for network security and
      decentralization.


      **Questions for Further Analysis:**


      - What is the historical performance trend of the dominant miner (`0xbf56...`)?
      Has their share of high-performance GPUs increased over time?

      - How do WAIFU POINTS relate to the overall health or security of the HEURIST
      network, given their variability among top performers?

      - Are there any upcoming protocol changes or hardware advancements expected
      to disrupt the current distribution of high-performance GPUs in the HEURIST
      ecosystem?'

query 4:
  input:
    query: How many transactions occurred on Ethereum yesterday?
    raw_data_only: false
  output:
    response: '**Ethereum Transaction Analysis for Yesterday (July 10, 2025)**


      **Blockchain Network:** Ethereum


      **Time Period:** July 10, 2025 (00:00:00 to 23:59:59)


      **Query Results:**


      * **Total Transactions Yesterday:** **1.51M** (1,506,260)


      **Observations:**


      * The Ethereum network processed over 1.5 million transactions yesterday, indicating
      a high volume of activity.

      * To put this into perspective, this averages out to approximately **1,758 transactions
      per minute** or **29 transactions per second**.


      **Trend/Pattern Identification:**

      Without historical data provided, we cannot identify specific trends or patterns.
      However, for context, if you''d like to compare this volume to previous days,
      weeks, or months to assess network activity trends, I can assist with generating
      a follow-up query for a broader time frame.


      **Possible Next Steps:**


      1. **Historical Comparison:** Compare yesterday''s transaction volume to the
      previous week, month, or quarter to identify any trends or anomalies.

      2. **Transaction Type Analysis:** Break down the transactions by type (e.g.,
      token transfers, smart contract interactions, etc.) to understand the nature
      of the activity.


      **Example Follow-up Queries:**


      * **Historical Comparison:** How do yesterday''s transactions compare to the
      average daily transactions for the last 30 days?

      * **Transaction Type Analysis:** What was the distribution of transaction types
      (e.g., ERC-20 transfers, ETH transfers, contract calls) for yesterday?

      **Analysis Period:** July 10, 2025, 00:00:00 to July 11, 2025, 00:00:00 (24
      hours)

      **Blockchain Network:** Ethereum


      **Query Results:**


      * **Largest Transaction Value:** **60,000 ETH** (approximately **$170M USD**,
      assuming an ETH price of $2,833 USD per coin)


      **Breakdown:**


      * **Transaction Value:** 60,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei (the native currency
      unit of Ethereum, where 1 ETH = 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 Wei)

      * **Converted Value (approximate):** $170,000,000 USD (based on current ETH
      price; please note that cryptocurrency prices fluctuate rapidly)


      **Observations:**


      1. **Significant Transaction:** A transaction of this magnitude is noteworthy,
      potentially indicating a large asset transfer between major wallets, institutions,
      or a significant NFT sale.

      2. **Market Impact:** Transactions of this size can temporarily influence Ethereum''s
      market dynamics, though the long-term impact depends on various market and economic
      factors.


      **Next Steps for Deeper Insight:**


      * Investigate the sender and recipient wallets to understand the nature of the
      transaction (e.g., exchange, institutional transfer, NFT market).

      * Analyze the transaction''s impact on Ethereum''s short-term market trends
      and gas prices.


      **Query Improvement Suggestions for Further Analysis:**


      * To identify the sender and recipient, modify the SQL query to also select
      the `FROM_ADDRESS` and `TO_ADDRESS` columns.

      * Example: `SELECT MAX(VALUE_) AS largest_transaction_value, FROM_ADDRESS, TO_ADDRESS
      FROM ETHEREUM.TRANSACTIONS WHERE time_stamp >= date_sub(CAST(''2025-07-11''
      AS DATE), 1) LIMIT 200;`'
