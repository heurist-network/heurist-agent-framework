      **Detailed Daily Breakdown:**


      The table below outlines the number of blocks created on the Ethereum network
      for each day over the last month. Note that the last day (June 12) reflects
      a partial day, as the query cutoff is assumed to be at the beginning of June
      12.

  input:
    query: How many transactions occurred on Ethereum yesterday?
    raw_data_only: false
  output:
    response: '**Ethereum Transaction Count for Yesterday (June 11, 2025)**


      **Blockchain Network:** Ethereum

      **Time Period Covered:** June 11, 2025 (00:00:00 to 23:59:59)


      **Transaction Count:** **1.45M** (1,450,751 transactions)


      **Key Observations:**


      * Yesterday, the Ethereum network processed approximately **1.45 million transactions**.

      * To put this into perspective, this averages out to around **57,114 transactions
      per hour** or about **952 transactions per minute**.


      **Context for Blockchain Metric:**

      The high transaction count on Ethereum indicates a significant level of activity
      on the network. This could be due to various factors such as:

      - High usage of decentralized applications (dApps)

      - Increased trading activity on decentralized exchanges (DEXs)

      - Growth in non-fungible token (NFT) marketplaces

      - Other smart contract interactions


      **Query Execution Details:**

      - **SQL Query:** `SELECT COUNT(*) AS transaction_count FROM ETHEREUM.TRANSACTIONS
      WHERE time_stamp >= CAST(''2025-06-11'' AS DATE) AND time_stamp < CAST(''2025-06-12''
      AS DATE) LIMIT 200;`

      - **Note on LIMIT 200:** Although the query includes a LIMIT 200 clause, the
      result returned is a single aggregate value (the total transaction count), which
      is not affected by the row limit. This suggests the database query optimizer
      handled the aggregation before applying the limit, or the limit was included
      unnecessarily for this type of query. For transaction count queries, such limits
      are typically not needed unless analyzing specific transaction details.'

      \ (e.g., investment, payment, or asset transfer) and parties involved in this\
      \ transaction cannot be determined.\n\n**Next Steps for Deeper Insights:**\n\
      \n* To understand the context better, you might want to query the transaction\
