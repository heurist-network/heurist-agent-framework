      query: Get the number of blocks created on Ethereum per day over the last month
      raw_data_only: false
    output:
      response: 'Over the past month (August 17, 2025, to September 16, 2025), the
        Ethereum network consistently produced blocks daily.


        **Key Observations:**


        *   **Consistent Block Production:** The number of blocks created each day
        remained remarkably stable, generally hovering around 7,160 to 7,170 blocks
        per day.

        *   **Minor Fluctuations:** There were minor daily fluctuations, with the
        highest count being 7,176 blocks on August 19th and 30th, and the lowest full
        day count being 7,122 blocks on September 10th.

        *   **Partial Day Data:** The data for September 16th shows 2,746 blocks,
        which is significantly lower than other days. This is expected as the query
        likely captured data for only a portion of that day.


        **Context:**


        On Ethereum, a "block" is a collection of new transactions confirmed and added
        to the blockchain. The consistent daily block count indicates a stable and
        healthy network operation. The target block time for Ethereum is approximately
        12 seconds, which translates to roughly 7,200 blocks per day (60 seconds/minute
        * 60 minutes/hour * 24 hours/day / 12 seconds/block). The observed numbers
        are very close to this theoretical target, demonstrating the network''s efficiency
        and reliability.'
