    response: '**Analysis: Ethereum Blocks Created per Day (March 12, 2025 - April
      11, 2025)**


      **Blockchain Network:** Ethereum

      **Time Period:** March 12, 2025, to April 11, 2025 (approximately 1 month)


      **Daily Block Creation Summary:**


      | **Date Range** | **Average Daily Blocks** | **Total Blocks** |

      | --- | --- | --- |

      | Mar 12 - Apr 10, 2025 | **7163** | **215,890** |

      | Apr 11, 2025 (partial day) | **2612** (pro-rated: ~65% of average daily) |
      **2,612** |


      **Detailed Daily Breakdown:**


      Below is a daily breakdown of block creation on the Ethereum network for the
      specified period. Note that April 11''s data is partial, reflecting only up
      to the query''s cutoff point.


      | **Block Date** | **Block Count** |

      | --- | --- |

      | 2025-03-12 | 7,160 |

      | 2025-03-13 | 7,169 |

      |... |... |

      | 2025-04-10 | 7,177 |

      | 2025-04-11 | 2,612 (partial day) |


      **Trends and Observations:**


      1. **Consistency in Block Creation:** The average daily block count is remarkably
      consistent, hovering around **7,163** blocks per day for the full days analyzed.
      This stability indicates a healthy and predictable network.

      2. **Partial Day Insight (Apr 11):** The block count for April 11 is **2,612**,
      which is approximately 65% of the average daily block creation. This partial
      day''s data suggests that the network was operating as expected up until the
      query''s cutoff point.

      3. **No Significant Anomalies:** There are no drastic spikes or dips in the
      block creation rate over the analyzed period, indicating a stable network environment
      without major disruptions or anomalies.


      **Context for Blockchain Metrics:**


      - **Block Creation Rate:** A consistent block creation rate is crucial for the
      Ethereum network''s health, ensuring timely transaction processing and smart
      contract execution.

      - **Network Stability:** The absence of significant anomalies in block creation
      suggests that the network experienced no major security breaches, forks, or
      technical issues during the analyzed period.'

query 4:
  input:
    query: How many transactions occurred on Ethereum yesterday?
    raw_data_only: false
  output:
    response: '**Ethereum Transaction Count for Yesterday (2025-04-10)**


      **Blockchain Network:** Ethereum

      **Time Period Covered:** 2025-04-10 (00:00:00 to 23:59:59)


      **Transaction Count:** **1.33M** (1,329,878 transactions)


      **Key Observations:**


      * Over 1.33 million transactions were processed on the Ethereum network yesterday,
      indicating a high level of activity.

      * To put this into perspective, this averages out to approximately **57,449
      transactions per hour** or around **958 transactions per minute**.


      **Trends and Patterns:**

      Without historical data provided in the query results, we cannot directly identify
      trends or patterns. However, if you''re interested in understanding how yesterday''s
      activity compares to previous days, weeks, or months, I can assist with generating
      a follow-up query to analyze transaction counts over a broader time frame.


      **Next Steps:**

      If you''d like to delve deeper into Ethereum''s transaction activity, consider
      the following queries:


      1. **Historical Transaction Comparison:** Compare yesterday''s transaction count
      with the average daily transactions over the past week/month.

      2. **Transaction Value Analysis:** Analyze the total Ether (ETH) or USD value
      of transactions for yesterday.

      3. **Network Congestion Insights:** Examine the average transaction fees for
      yesterday to understand network congestion levels.


      Please let me know which direction you''d like to explore, and I''ll craft the
      appropriate SQL query.'
