    query: What's the most active address on Ethereum during the last 24 hours?

    response: "**Ethereum On-Chain Data Analysis Response**\n\n**Query Summary:**\n\
      * **Blockchain:** Ethereum\n* **Query:** Most Active Address in the Last 24\
      \ Hours\n\n**Results:**\n\n* **Status:** Success (`code: 0`)\n* **Message:**\

      \     |\n\n**Insights and Observations:**\n\n1. **Exceptional Activity:** The\
      \ address `0xdac17f958d2ee523a2206206994597c13d831ec7` has shown an extraordinarily\
      \ high level of activity, with **148,595 transactions** within the last 24 hours.\
      \ This volume significantly surpasses typical address activity, suggesting automated\
      \ or high-frequency trading operations.\n\n2. **Possible Use Cases:**\n   -\
      \ **High-Frequency Trading Bot:** The address might be utilized by a trading\
      \ bot designed to capitalize on market fluctuations with rapid buy/sell orders.\n\
      \   - **Decentralized Application (dApp) Contract:** It could be a smart contract\
      \ address for a highly interactive dApp, such as a gaming platform, decentralized\
      \ exchange (DEX), or a social media platform, though the transaction volume\
      \ leans more towards trading activity.\n   - **Wallet Service or Exchange:**\
      \ Less likely, but it might be a wallet service or an exchange's hot wallet,\
      \ though the transaction pattern would typically show more balance variability.\n\
      \n3. **Further Analysis Suggestions:**\n   - **Transaction Type Analysis:**\
      \ Breaking down the types of transactions (e.g., ETH transfers, contract interactions,\
      \ token transfers) could provide clearer insights into the address's primary\
      \ use.\n   - **Counterparty Analysis:** Examining the most frequent counterparties\
      \ could reveal if the address interacts predominantly with known exchanges,\
      \ other suspected bots, or a diverse set of addresses.\n   - **Historical Activity\
      \ Review:** Comparing the last 24 hours' activity with historical data could\
      \ indicate if this level of activity is anomalous or part of a recurring pattern.\n\
      \n**Limitations of Current Analysis:**\n- This analysis is based solely on transaction\
      \ volume and does not account for the nature (type) of these transactions or\
      \ the involved assets (ETH, tokens, etc.).\n- Deeper insights"

    response: '**Error Response Analysis**


      **Blockchain Specified:** `solana`

      **Query Requested:** Most active address on **Bitcoin** during the last 24 hours


      **Error Details:**

      - **Code:** 5000

      - **Message (msg):** Query failed or was cancelled.

      - **Detail:** Query failed or was cancelled.


      **Resolution and Clarification:**


      The error occurs due to a **blockchain mismatch** between the specified blockchain
      (`solana`) and the blockchain requested in the query (`Bitcoin`). Our system
      is designed to analyze data from the blockchain explicitly mentioned in the
      query parameters, but in this case, there''s a discrepancy:


      1. **Specified Blockchain:** `solana`

      2. **Requested Blockchain in Query:** `Bitcoin`


      **Supported Blockchains (for reference):**

      - Ethereum

      - Base

      - Bitcoin

      - Solana


      **To Retrieve Meaningful Data:**

      Please reformulate your query to match the blockchain you wish to analyze. Here
      are two corrected query examples based on your original request:


      ### **Option 1: Analyze Solana (as originally specified)**

      - **Blockchain:** `solana` (no change needed)

      - **Revised Query:** "What''s the most active address on Solana during the last
      24 hours?"


      ### **Option 2: Analyze Bitcoin (as requested in the query)**

      - **Blockchain:** `bitcoin` (update the specified blockchain)

      - **Query Remains:** "What''s the most active address on Bitcoin during the
      last 24 hours?"


      **Submit the revised query for a detailed on-chain data analysis.**'
