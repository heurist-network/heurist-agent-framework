  input:
    query: Identify the biggest transaction of ETH in the past 30 days
  output:
    response: 'It seems like there''s an unexpected technical issue here. The error
      message you''ve provided doesn''t relate directly to the blockchain query you
      asked me to process ("Identify the biggest transaction of ETH in the past 30
      days"). Instead, it indicates a failure in the API request to a specific backend
      service. Let''s break down the situation and provide a constructive response:


      **Original Query:** Identify the biggest transaction of ETH in the past 30 days
      (Inferred Blockchain: Ethereum)


      **Expected Response Format:** Natural language response with relevant data (e.g.,
      "The largest ETH transaction in the past 30 days was X ETH, occurring on Date,
      from Address A to Address B, with Transaction Hash XYZ.")


      **Actual Response (Due to API Error):**


      Unfortunately, due to a technical issue (API request failed with a 404 error),
      I''m unable to fetch the required data from the blockchain analytics tool at
      this moment. The error message suggests a backend service issue rather than
      a problem with the query itself.


      **Interpreted Query for Future Reference (once the API is available):**

      "What is the largest Ether (ETH) transaction by value on the Ethereum blockchain
      within the last 30 days, including details such as transaction hash, sender,
      recipient, and timestamp?"


      **Solution:**

      - **Retry:** Once the API issue is resolved, re-submit your query to obtain
      the desired blockchain data.

      - **Alternative:** If you have another query related to Ethereum, Bitcoin, Base,
      or Solana blockchains, feel free to ask, and I''ll attempt to process it once
      the API is operational.


      Please let me know if there''s an alternative query I can assist with or if
      you''d like to retry the original question once the technical issue is presumably
      fixed.'
