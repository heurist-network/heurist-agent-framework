      response: 'Arbitrum (token symbol: ARB) is an Ethereum Layer2 scaling solution.


        It is an Ethereum Layer2 scaling solution based on Optimistic Rollup technology,
        created by the Offchain Labs team. It enables trustless transfer of any Ethereum
        asset between Layer 1 and Layer 2, significantly reducing gas fees by submitting
        only raw transaction data to Ethereum while execution and contract storage
        occur off-chain.

          description: Arbitrum, created by the Offchain Labs team, is an Ethereum
            Layer2 scaling solution based on Optimistic Rollup technology. It leverages
            the ability to communicate between L1 and L2, allowing any form of Ethereum
            asset to be transferred between Layer 1 and Layer 2 without the need for
            trust. Even though Arbitrum transactions are still settled on Ethereum,
            only raw transaction data is submitted to Ethereum, with execution and
            contract storage occurring off-chain. This makes the gas fee required
            on Arbitrum much smaller than on the mainnet, and contracts are fully
            compatible with no gas limit.

          one_liner: The first blockchain with smart contract functionality
          description: Ethereum is the first decentralized, open-source blockchain
            with smart contract functionality. It was initially described in a white
            paper by Vitalik Buterin in late 2013 and launched in 2015. This network
            serves as the foundation for an ecosystem of interoperable, decentralized
            applications (dApps) powered by token economies and automated smart contracts.
            Assets and applications designed on Ethereum are built with self-executing
            smart contracts that eliminate the need for a central authority or intermediary.
            u2028The network is powered by its native cryptocurrency ether (ETH),
            which is used to pay transaction fees. Ethereum has the characteristics
            of being open-source, programmable, private, and censorship-resistant,
            forming the backbone of a decentralized internet.
