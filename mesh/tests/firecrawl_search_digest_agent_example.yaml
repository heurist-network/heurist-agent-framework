  input:
    query: What are the most recent developments in decentralized AI and blockchain integration?
    raw_data_only: false
  output:
    response: '**Blockchain Integration in Decentralized AI**


      *   **Forced Integration for Funding:** Many Web3 AI projects are **"forcing blockchain integration"** not due to technical
      necessity, but to **"access Web3 funding, expertise and communities"** and to meet **"investment criteria around blockchain
      integration"** from venture funds. This "blockchain-first mentality" is actively harming innovation in decentralized
      AI.

      *   **Stifling Innovation:** The trend of equating "decentralized AI" with "blockchain AI" **"stifling creative exploration
      of other technological approaches"** like federated learning, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, and edge computing, none
      of which inherently require blockchain.

      *   **Blockchain''s Specific Use Cases:** While not a universal solution, blockchain can be useful for specific functions
      in decentralized AI, such as **"onchain settlement can simplify payments between AI agents, cryptographic proofs can
      improve reputation systems, and tokens can align incentives in collaborative training."**

      *   **Examples of Blockchain Integration:** Projects like **"Numerai uses the chain to manage stakes for models developed
      by the community, rewarding the best-performing ones."** Similarly, **"Torus Network distributes token rewards transparently
      to the agents that contribute the most to its long-term growth"** and **"Render Network’s token-based payment means
      that anyone, anywhere, can provide compute to its render farm."**

      *   **Decentralized AI Beyond Blockchain:** True decentralized AI encompasses a broader range of technologies, including
      **"distributed computing, federated learning, P2P networks and edge computing, none of which inherently require blockchain
      infrastructure."** Examples of successful non-blockchain decentralized AI projects include **"Prime Intellect has trained
      large language models at scale while preserving decentralization,"** **"The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s
      NANDA is building a decentralized internet of agents,"** and **"LAION is democratizing AI research."**

      *   **Web3 Ideals vs. Blockchain Technology:** The article highlights that **"Web3 philosophy differs from blockchain
      technology."** Web3 ideals, such as trustlessness, permissionlessness, censorship resistance, and user ownership, can
      be achieved through various technological approaches, not just blockchain.

      *   **Risk of Centralization in AI:** Current centralized AI models are vulnerable to **"cost volatility," "supply risk,"**
      and **"licenses can be revoked,"** leading to a "Great API Purge." Decentralized AI, mirroring Bitcoin''s breakthrough,
      can offer an **"antifragile mesh where no vendor can lock the doors"** by distributing compute, models, and data across
      multiple nodes.

      *   **Blockchain as a Trust Layer:** Blockchain offers **"transparency, security, and decentralization"** to AI. It
      can ensure **"data provenance and integrity,"** enable **"decentralized AI marketplaces,"** facilitate **"smart contracts
      for automated AI workflows,"** and improve **"identity and access management"** by giving users control over their data.

      *   **Market Growth and Adoption:** The global blockchain market is projected to reach **"$67.4 billion by 2026, growing
      at a CAGR of over 50%,"** with over **"80% of Fortune 500 companies are actively exploring or implementing blockchain
      solutions."**

      *   **Investment Opportunities:** Blockchain provides **"the backbone for decentralized compute, secure data exchange,
      and tokenized incentives critical for scalable AI ecosystems."** Investing in blockchain solutions can **"hedge against
      AI’s ethical, privacy, and centralization risks."**

      *   **AI⁴ as a Decentralized AI Ecosystem:** AI⁴ is a decentralized AI ecosystem that **"merges blockchain incentives
      with agentic intelligence."** It allows for **"real-time intelligence evolution through on-chain data and external APIs"**
      and **"token-driven reward structures that align user contributions with AI’s performance."** The project''s token is
      described as "the first token that learns," reflecting its continuous adaptation based on live market data, web content,
      and community inputs.

            # Blockchain AI cannibalizes decentralized AI


            Web3 AI projects often force blockchain integration to access capital, harming innovation by prioritizing ecosystem
            compatibility over practical AI solutions.

            COINTELEGRAPH IN YOUR SOCIAL FEED


            [Follow our](https://twitter.com/cointelegraph) [Follow our](https://www.instagram.com/cointelegraph/)


            _**Opinion by: Samuele Marro, PhD student in machine learning at the University of Oxford**_


            The Web3 AI space has fallen into a trap. Somewhere along the way, “decentralized AI” became synonymous with “blockchain
            AI.” This false equivalency actively harms innovation.


            Excellent decentralized AI projects contort themselves into blockchain frameworks, not because it makes technical
            sense, but because that’s the only way to access Web3 funding, expertise and communities. The blockchain-first
            mentality isn’t just limiting what decentralized AI could become; it’s cannibalizing it.


            ## Web3 is not blockchain


            Web3 [ideals](https://cointelegraph.com/news/vitalik-buterin-cypherpunk-ethereum-dns "null") emerged from [cypherpunk](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-cypherpunk
            "null"): trustlessness, permissionlessness, censorship resistance and user ownership. The industry has forgotten
            a critical distinction: Web3 philosophy differs from blockchain technology. BitTorrent is Web3. Tor is Web3. IPFS
            is Web3. And now that Web3 AI is at the center of the hype, many find blockchains are often ill-suited.


            Jump into any Web3 AI space, and you’ll see the same pattern repeating: brilliant teams building distributed learning
            networks, peer-to-peer (P2P) AI marketplaces and distributed training systems, all awkwardly explaining why they
            need a token or how their onchain settlement works.


            As a counterexample, consider [federated learning](https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-federated-learning "null"),
            where multiple nodes collaborate to train a shared AI model while keeping their raw data private. This is a prime
            example of decentralized AI: No tokens are required.


            That isn’t to say blockchain is never useful. Onchain settlement can simplify payments between AI agents, cryptographic
            proofs can improve reputation systems, and tokens can align incentives in collaborative training. But those are
            specialized tools, not one-size-fits-all solutions. For many decentralized-AI problems, blockchain overhead only
            adds latency, complexity and cost.


            ## A game of incentives


            Why do projects make these decisions? The answer lies in how the [Web3](https://cointelegraph.com/learn/articles/what-is-web-3-0-a-beginners-guide-to-the-decentralized-internet-of-the-future
            "null") ecosystem has evolved. Projects that don’t integrate blockchains aren’t considered “Web3” and thus can’t
            access Web3 funding pipelines, expert networks or community resources. In their thesis, venture funds with “Web3”
            built investment criteria around blockchain integration. Web3 AI spaces treat non-blockchain projects as out of
            scope.


            ![](https://images.cointelegraph.com/images/373_aHR0cHM6Ly9zMy5jb2ludGVsZWdyYXBoLmNvbS9zdG9yYWdlL3VwbG9hZHMvdmlldy9hNGFkNDk1ZmMwNGJkOTdmNzE2NDlhNDhkNjAwM2QwMC5wbmc=.png)


            These incentives drive teams to adopt blockchain not for product reasons but for ecosystem access. In other words,
            they’re making architectural decisions based on fundraising requirements rather than optimal user outcomes. There’s
            nothing wrong with playing the game, but it means that many opportunities for genuine (and profitable) applications
            of decentralized AI are being overlooked.


            The industry must recognize that three distinct concepts have been artificially bundled together.


            _**Related:**_ [_**Can blockchain supply the guardrails to keep AI on course?**_](https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-ai-hybrid-adoption
            "https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-ai-hybrid-adoption")


            Decentralized AI includes distributed computing, federated learning, P2P networks and edge computing, none of
            which inherently require blockchain infrastructure.


            Crypto-integrated AI involves token incentives, cryptographic proofs, digital asset management and legitimate
            use cases that can be implemented using blockchains.


            Web3 AI represents user ownership, permissionless innovation and community governance, which can be achieved through
            multiple technological approaches.


            These concepts can work together beautifully, but they don’t need to. A federated learning network can use cryptographic
            privacy guarantees without touching a blockchain. A distributed AI marketplace can implement reputation-based
            validation without smart contracts. Incentive systems can operate through consensus mechanisms that don’t require
            the overhead of a whole blockchain infrastructure.


            ## Decentralized AI needs a toolbox


            True innovation in decentralized AI requires technological pluralism, with blockchain being a tool in the toolkit,
            not a religious requirement. The most successful projects of the next decade will be those that choose the right
            architecture for their specific challenges, not those that conform to current ecosystem expectations.


            Web3 funding and community support must evolve to embrace [non-blockchain](https://cointelegraph.com/news/future-of-web3-is-not-blockchain
            "null") decentralization. Venture funds can get substantial returns on decentralized and aligned projects with
            Web3, even if their funding model is not token-based.


            Communities should celebrate permissionless innovation regardless of its technical substrate. For example, numerous
            decentralized AI ecosystems exist beyond crypto, both nonprofit and for-profit. Prime Intellect has trained large
            language models at scale while preserving decentralization. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s NANDA
            is [building](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jlcO19XyQ1I "null") a decentralized internet of agents. LAION is
            democratizing AI research.


            These systems achieve genuine decentralization; they don’t carry a blockchain badge and are invisible to much
            of the Web3 community. Even in the more traditional Web3 AI space, however, there are positive signals from projects
            that use blockchains only when it makes sense.


            Numerai uses the chain to manage stakes for models developed by the community, rewarding the best-performing ones.
            Torus Network distributes token rewards transparently to the agents that contribute the most to its long-term
            growth while capturing the network value in the token. Render Network’s token-based payment means that anyone,
            anywhere, can provide compute to its render farm. All of these applications are already here.


            The current blockchain-first approach is constraining innovation in decentralized AI precisely when it’s needed
            the most. As AI systems become more powerful and centralized, there’s a desperate need for decentralized alternatives.
            But they won’t be achieved if the ecosystem keeps forcing every solution through the blockchain bottleneck. The
            projects that shed this inefficient mindset today will dominate the ecosystem tomorrow.


            Web3 AI faces a choice: continue cannibalizing decentralized AI with blockchain requirements or liberate it to
            achieve its full potential. The technology is ready. The question is whether the ecosystem is ready to evolve
            and who can capitalize on this change.

            \ Summary\n\nOverviewThe 5 WsOpposite SidesInfobox\n\n\\- Blockchain integration in Web3 AI is increasingly viewed\
            \ as a limiting factor, with projects adopting it for funding access rather than technical necessity.\n\n\\- This\
            \ trend creates a false equivalence between decentralized AI and blockchain AI, stifling exploration of alternatives\
            \ like federated learning and edge computing.\n\n\\- Successful non-blockchain projects (e.g., Prime Intellect,\
            \ NANDA) demonstrate decentralized AI can thrive without blockchain, yet remain overlooked due to ecosystem biases.\n\
            \n\\- While some projects use blockchain for specific functions (e.g., Numerai's model staking), the industry\
            \ risks constraining innovation by forcing blockchain into all frameworks.\n\n\\- The Web3 AI ecosystem faces\
            \ a critical choice: maintain the blockchain-first bias or evolve toward flexible, use-case-driven approaches\
            \ to decentralized innovation.\n\nThe integration of blockchain into Web3 AI is increasingly seen as a limiting\
            \ factor rather than a driver of innovation, according to recent analysis. Many decentralized AI projects are\
            \ adopting blockchain not for technical necessity but to access funding, community support, and infrastructure\
            \ typically available in the Web3 ecosystem \\[1\\]. This trend has led to a false equivalency where decentralized\
            \ AI is equated with blockchain AI, stifling creative exploration of other technological approaches \\[1\\].\n\
            \nAsk Aime: Why is blockchain being overused in Web3 AI, hindering innovation?\n\nDecentralized AI, by definition,\
            \ encompasses a range of innovations such as\n\n[federated](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-FHI/)\n\n[FHI\\\
            \\\n--](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NYSE-FHI/)\n\nlearning, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, and edge computing,\
            \ none of which inherently require blockchain \\[1\\]. For example, federated learning enables multiple nodes\
            \ to collaboratively train an AI model while keeping their raw data private—achieved without the use of tokens\
            \ or blockchain infrastructure \\[1\\]. Despite these viable alternatives, the current ecosystem often treats\
            \ blockchain integration as a prerequisite for being considered a “Web3” project, creating a distorted incentive\
            \ structure \\[1\\].\n\nThis blockchain-first mentality has driven teams to adopt on-chain solutions not for product\
            \ development, but to meet the expectations of venture funds and community stakeholders who prioritize blockchain-based\
            \ projects \\[1\\]. As a result, many decentralized AI initiatives are forced into frameworks that add unnecessary\
            \ complexity, cost, and latency to their architectures \\[1\\]. The industry’s conflation of Web3 ideals—such\
            \ as user ownership, permissionless innovation, and censorship resistance—with blockchain technology has obscured\
            \ the broader potential of decentralized systems \\[1\\].\n\nTrue innovation in AI requires a toolkit approach,\
            \ where blockchain is one of many possible tools rather than a mandatory requirement \\[1\\]. Projects that succeed\
            \ will be those that choose the most suitable architecture for their specific use case rather than conforming\
            \ to prevailing ecosystem norms \\[1\\]. For instance, while blockchain can simplify payments between AI agents\
            \ or improve reputation systems, it is not always the optimal solution for every decentralized AI challenge \\\
            [1\\].\n\nSeveral non-blockchain-based projects demonstrate successful decentralized AI models. Prime Intellect\
            \ has trained large language models at scale while preserving decentralization. The Massachusetts Institute of\
            \ Technology’s NANDA is building a decentralized internet of agents, and LAION is democratizing AI research \\\
            [1\\]. These examples highlight how decentralized AI can thrive without blockchain, yet they remain largely invisible\
            \ to the broader Web3 community due to the current incentive structure \\[1\\].\n\nSome Web3 projects, however,\
            \ are beginning to explore blockchain integration only when it makes technical sense. Numerai uses blockchain\
            \ to manage stakes for community-developed models, rewarding the best-performing ones. Torus Network distributes\
            \ token-based rewards to contributors, and Render Network uses token-based payments to incentivize compute sharing.\
            \ These applications showcase how blockchain can be a useful tool within the right context \\[1\\].\n\nThe current\
            \ trajectory of blockchain-first thinking risks constraining the future of decentralized AI at a time when such\
            \ innovations are most needed. As AI systems become more powerful and centralized, the demand for decentralized\
            \ alternatives is growing. However, these solutions cannot emerge if the industry continues to force blockchain\
            \ into every decentralized AI framework \\[1\\].\n\nThe Web3 AI ecosystem faces a critical choice: continue reinforcing\
            \ the false equivalence between blockchain and decentralized AI or evolve to embrace a more inclusive and flexible\
            \ approach. The technology is ready. Whether the ecosystem is prepared to adapt—and who stands to benefit from\
            \ this transformation—remains to be seen \\[1\\].\n\nSource: \\[1\\]Web3 AI: Exploring the Impact of Blockchain\

            _**Opinion by: Ahmad Shadid, founder of O.xyz and co-founder of IO.ne**_


            Not a single week passes by without a new artificial intelligence startup coming out of stealth.


            With a slick interface, clever prompts and an OpenAI key powering the back-end, these ventures often boast seed
            valuations that make even a veteran chip designer blush.


            Behind the gloss sits little more than “prompt arbitrage.” Most of today’s so-called “AI companies” are just thin
            packaging layers without defensible technology.


            The company pays a few cents to ask a proprietary model a question, then charges users a few dollars for the same
            answer and pockets the difference. That margin lasts only until the platform decides to rate-limit the traffic,
            raise prices or change its terms of service.


            That fragility is invisible to most users, but it’s lethal to the sector’s long-term credibility. When the gatekeeper
            pivots, thousands of copy-and-paste apps will vanish overnight, taking investor capital and customer data.


            **The great API purge**


            What comes next will be a reckoning: We will have witnessed the “Great API Purge” by 2027, a moment when the platform
            landlords reclaim their territory. They will implement 10x price hikes and draconian usage quotas, obliterating
            70% of today’s AI startups overnight.


            The only ventures left standing will be those that built their foundation on the bedrock of decentralized infrastructure.


            An industry built on rented compute cannot call itself infrastructure — it is merely UX theater.


            **Rented compute is a single point of failure**


            Reliance on centralized APIs introduces several systemic risks. First comes cost volatility: A sudden fee hike
            for the GPT-4o endpoint can easily double some projects’ operating expenses.


            Next is supply risk: GPU shortages have forced several leading providers to throttle throughput for smaller customers
            during peak demand. Finally, licenses can be revoked. A simple policy update can bar entire content categories,
            turning once-viable writing tools into empty screens.


            Each risk traces back to the same bottleneck: control of the inference pipeline. That choke point mirrors the
            early days of online payments, when Visa and PayPal could freeze accounts at will. Finance solved that problem
            in 2009 with Bitcoin. AI now faces its own Satoshi moment.


            **Decentralized AI echoes Bitcoin’s breakthrough**


            Bitcoin separated money from any single issuer by distributing consensus across thousands of nodes. A decentralized
            AI stack can do the same for compute, models and data. Instead of a single API key, an application would tap multiple
            model pools.


            Execution hops to whichever GPU cluster clears the job fastest and cheapest. In this new paradigm, model APIs
            are treated like interchangeable commodities. Model checkpoints live on durable storage such as InterPlanetary
            File System or Arweave; parameter updates propagate through verifiable proofs. The result is an antifragile mesh
            where no vendor can lock the doors.


            The shift is already visible. Some networks auction idle GPU cycles to the highest bidder, while other projects
            design agents that can migrate between models without rewriting code. If the largest provider goes dark, workloads
            reroute, like Bitcoin rebalances hash power after a mining pool collapse.


            **Defensible AI roots itself in Web3**


            Web3 supplies the incentive layer that Web2 lacks. Tokens meter compute and data, proofs certify results, and
            onchain payouts align thousands of independent GPU operators, model curators and data stewards without a central
            landlord. Censorship-resistant storage plus validator-checked execution keeps weights, prompts and agent state
            reachable even if a cloud region or jurisdiction goes dark.


            Just as important, smart contract governance lets stakeholders vote in new safety rules or swap out underperforming
            models without begging a platform for permission. Any stack that rests on Software-as-a-Service keys will bend
            to the next terms-of-service tweak, one that embeds value, logic and upgrades onchain and can keep running long
            after today’s wrapper apps disappear.


            **Market stakes for investors and builders**


            The repricing will be brutal. Startups valued on user-interface sizzle will trade at a discount once capital realizes
            that margins depend on someone else’s server farm. Conversely, tokens and equities tied to verifiable compute
            networks, licensed data cooperatives and agent runtimes will command a premium.


            Institutional demand is already shifting. Asset managers cite resilience and fee capture as primary theses. Meanwhile,
            large language model providers want guaranteed content rights.


            Shutterstock’s partnership with OpenAI proved that clean data is worth real money; decentralized tokenized licenses
            extend that logic to every blogger and podcaster on the web.


            **Tokenize access and make the bots pay**


            Bitcoin taught a fundamental lesson for the digital age: Lasting value is built on resilience. An industry that
            ignores this does so at its peril, creating an illusion of infrastructure on a foundation that a landlord can
            revoke at any moment.


            The enduring projects of the AI era will therefore be governed by code instead of contracts. Instead of the current
            funding cycle, these projects are engineered for the subsequent collapse and the next infrastructure shift. To
            be successful, they will be model-agnostic, compute-diverse and owned by their communities. They will be the ones
            who understand that the future of intelligence cannot be leased. It must be built, and its keys must belong to
            its builders.

            ![Why Blockchain Deserves Attention Despite AI Hype](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D5612AQGIGT4jletpSA/article-cover_image-shrink_720_1280/B56ZiZGeS8HUAI-/0/1754915271061?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=3qBCpMWQX35hqPIHglUP8FPBbyWrVNosJortU_BHK7U)


            In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has captured the imagination of industries, investors, and technologists
            alike. From automating complex tasks to revolutionizing data analysis, AI promises a future brimming with unprecedented
            possibilities. However, amid this AI frenzy, another transformative technology—blockchain—often gets overshadowed.
            While AI is undoubtedly shaping the future, blockchain deserves significant attention as a complementary and foundational
            technology that addresses critical challenges AI alone cannot solve.


            ### The AI Hype and Its Limitations


            AI''s ability to process massive datasets, identify patterns, and make decisions has driven explosive growth and
            innovation. However, AI models frequently operate as “black boxes,” providing results without transparent explanations.
            This lack of transparency raises concerns about trust, bias, and accountability.


            Moreover, AI systems rely heavily on vast amounts of data, which introduces significant privacy risks. Centralized
            data stores, common in many AI applications, become lucrative targets for hackers and raise ethical questions
            about data ownership.


            ### Blockchain: The Trust Layer AI Needs


            Blockchain technology shines precisely where AI struggles: transparency, security, and decentralization.


            - Transparency & Immutability: Blockchain’s distributed ledger ensures all transactions and data changes are recorded
            immutably and publicly verifiable. This transparency can help verify the provenance of data used to train AI models,
            making AI decisions more auditable.

            - Decentralization: Unlike centralized AI systems that concentrate data and control in a few hands, blockchain
            distributes data across a network of nodes, reducing single points of failure and censorship risks.

            - Security & Privacy: Blockchain’s cryptographic security protects data integrity and enables privacy-preserving
            mechanisms such as zero-knowledge proofs, ensuring sensitive information is not exposed unnecessarily.


            ### Enhancing AI with Blockchain: Use Cases That Matter


            The synergy between AI and blockchain is already evident in emerging use cases:


            - Data Provenance and Integrity: Ensuring AI models are trained on authentic, untampered data is crucial. Blockchain
            can serve as a trusted record of data origins, increasing confidence in AI outputs.

            - Decentralized AI Marketplaces: Blockchain enables peer-to-peer sharing of AI models and datasets without centralized
            intermediaries, promoting democratized access and fair compensation.

            - Smart Contracts for Automated AI Workflows: Combining blockchain-based smart contracts with AI algorithms enables
            automated, self-executing workflows with clear rules and accountability.

            - Identity and Access Management: Blockchain-based decentralized identities can give users control over their
            data used in AI, aligning with privacy regulations like GDPR.


            ### Blockchain by the Numbers: Positive Trends and Impact


            - Bitcoin’s Market Growth: Bitcoin, the flagship blockchain asset, has grown from virtually zero in 2009 to a
            market capitalization exceeding $600 billion in 2025, demonstrating sustained investor confidence and adoption.
            Despite volatility, Bitcoin’s price has increased by over 400% in the past 3 years alone.

            - Global Blockchain Market: The global blockchain market size is projected to reach $67.4 billion by 2026, growing
            at a CAGR of over 50%, driven by enterprise adoption, DeFi, and NFT applications.

            - DeFi Expansion: Decentralized Finance (DeFi) platforms locked over $90 billion in assets in 2025, showcasing
            blockchain’s capacity to disrupt traditional finance through trustless and permissionless protocols.

            - Institutional Adoption: Over 80% of Fortune 500 companies are actively exploring or implementing blockchain
            solutions, including AI-enhanced supply chain management and secure data sharing.

            - Energy & Sustainability Advances: New blockchain consensus mechanisms like Proof-of-Stake (PoS) have reduced
            energy consumption by up to 99% compared to earlier Proof-of-Work models, addressing environmental concerns often
            linked to blockchain.


            These statistics underscore blockchain’s ongoing relevance and growth despite the AI spotlight, proving it is
            not just a supporting technology but a major force reshaping multiple industries.


            ### Why Investors Should Care


            Despite the AI hype, blockchain presents unique investment opportunities that complement AI’s strengths:


            - Infrastructure for the AI Economy: Blockchain provides the backbone for decentralized compute, secure data exchange,
            and tokenized incentives critical for scalable AI ecosystems.

            - Risk Mitigation: Investing in blockchain solutions can hedge against AI’s ethical, privacy, and centralization
            risks.

            - Early Mover Advantage: As AI and blockchain increasingly intertwine, companies that master both technologies
            may lead the next wave of innovation.


            ### Conclusion: Blockchain Is Not the Enemy of AI—It’s Its Enabler


            While AI grabs headlines with dazzling applications, blockchain quietly addresses the foundational challenges
            AI faces around trust, security, and control. Far from being a competing technology, blockchain is a vital partner
            that can unlock AI’s full potential in a responsible, transparent, and decentralized way.


            In the race toward an AI-driven future, ignoring blockchain would be a critical oversight. For innovators, investors,
            and technologists alike, blockchain still deserves a prominent seat at the table.

            AI can make decisions at speed, but without blockchain’s transparency and auditability, you’re still relying on
            blind trust. In my work, I’ve seen how pairing the two not only strengthens security but also builds confidence
            for investors and users who’d never trust a black-box system.

            _**Community-driven AI ecosystem merges live market data, autonomous reasoning, and blockchain incentives to create
            the world''s first adaptive intelligence powered by its own token economy.**_


            **HELSINKI, FI / [ACCESS Newswire](https://www.accessnewswire.com/) / August 12, 2025 /** **AI⁴**, an emerging
            leader in decentralized artificial intelligence, today announced a milestone in its mission to connect autonomous
            AI agents directly to the open web, blockchain networks, and live market signals. Branded as "the first token
            that learns," AI⁴ is building an ecosystem where every token holder contributes to - and benefits from - the intelligence''s
            growth.


            > "The AI we''re building doesn''t just respond - it adapts. It reads the markets, absorbs community input, and
            rewrites its own playbook in real time," said a core AI⁴ contributor. "If Bitcoin was digital gold, AI⁴ is digital
            instinct - and it''s getting sharper every block."


            **Core Technology**


            AI⁴ integrates agentic AI frameworks with blockchain-based incentive loops, enabling:


            - Real-time intelligence evolution through on-chain data and external APIs


            - Direct community influence over AI learning priorities


            - Token-driven reward structures that align user contributions with AI''s performance



            **Why It Matters**


            Traditional AI models operate in isolation, relying on static datasets. AI⁴''s architecture is designed to stay
            in motion, continuously pulling live market data, web content, and community inputs to train itself - creating
            a feedback loop between intelligence, utility, and token value.


            **Community-First Growth**


            From launch, AI⁴''s Telegram community has helped shape capabilities - from strategy prompts to cultural references
            that resonate with crypto markets. This organic "crowd‑training" model accelerates the AI''s adaptation curve.


            > "Some say the AI is watching the charts," an early community member joked, "but the real alpha is that the charts
            might start watching it back."


            **Looking Ahead**


            The team is preparing integrations with leading DEX platforms and real-time analytics dashboards, expanding AI⁴''s
            reach into liquidity management, portfolio optimization, and predictive market mapping.

        processed_summary: '**Blockchain Integration in Decentralized AI**


          *   **Forced Integration for Funding:** Many Web3 AI projects are **"forcing blockchain integration"** not due to
          technical necessity, but to **"access Web3 funding, expertise and communities"** and to meet **"investment criteria
          around blockchain integration"** from venture funds. This "blockchain-first mentality" is actively harming innovation
          in decentralized AI.

          *   **Stifling Innovation:** The trend of equating "decentralized AI" with "blockchain AI" **"stifling creative
          exploration of other technological approaches"** like federated learning, peer-to-peer (P2P) networks, and edge
          computing, none of which inherently require blockchain.

          *   **Blockchain''s Specific Use Cases:** While not a universal solution, blockchain can be useful for specific
          functions in decentralized AI, such as **"onchain settlement can simplify payments between AI agents, cryptographic
          proofs can improve reputation systems, and tokens can align incentives in collaborative training."**

          *   **Examples of Blockchain Integration:** Projects like **"Numerai uses the chain to manage stakes for models
          developed by the community, rewarding the best-performing ones."** Similarly, **"Torus Network distributes token
          rewards transparently to the agents that contribute the most to its long-term growth"** and **"Render Network’s
          token-based payment means that anyone, anywhere, can provide compute to its render farm."**

          *   **Decentralized AI Beyond Blockchain:** True decentralized AI encompasses a broader range of technologies, including
          **"distributed computing, federated learning, P2P networks and edge computing, none of which inherently require
          blockchain infrastructure."** Examples of successful non-blockchain decentralized AI projects include **"Prime Intellect
          has trained large language models at scale while preserving decentralization,"** **"The Massachusetts Institute
          of Technology’s NANDA is building a decentralized internet of agents,"** and **"LAION is democratizing AI research."**

          *   **Web3 Ideals vs. Blockchain Technology:** The article highlights that **"Web3 philosophy differs from blockchain
          technology."** Web3 ideals, such as trustlessness, permissionlessness, censorship resistance, and user ownership,
          can be achieved through various technological approaches, not just blockchain.

          *   **Risk of Centralization in AI:** Current centralized AI models are vulnerable to **"cost volatility," "supply
          risk,"** and **"licenses can be revoked,"** leading to a "Great API Purge." Decentralized AI, mirroring Bitcoin''s
          breakthrough, can offer an **"antifragile mesh where no vendor can lock the doors"** by distributing compute, models,
          and data across multiple nodes.

          *   **Blockchain as a Trust Layer:** Blockchain offers **"transparency, security, and decentralization"** to AI.
          It can ensure **"data provenance and integrity,"** enable **"decentralized AI marketplaces,"** facilitate **"smart
          contracts for automated AI workflows,"** and improve **"identity and access management"** by giving users control

            # A beginner’s guide on blockchain layer-2 scaling solutions


            ![](https://images.cointelegraph.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=90,width=785/https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/81cdc085800291ede803335077496178.jpg)
            Blockchain


            ## Do layer-1 blockchains address blockchain network scalability issues?


            When the [concept of blockchain technology](https://cointelegraph.com/blockchain-for-beginners/how-does-blockchain-work-everything-there-is-to-know)
            was introduced to the world back in 2009 with Bitcoin , the primary focus was on providing a decentralized and
            secure distributed database technology that can cater to transparent transaction ability.


            It necessitated the creation of a native token for facilitating payment for transactions on the network, leading
            to popular cryptocurrencies such as BTC coming into existence. However, as the blockchain ecosystem kept growing
            at an exponential rate, it exposed the fundamental concern of low transaction speeds and the inherent lack of
            scalability provided by such layer-1 blockchains.


            A layer-1 blockchain, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, is the base protocol that is then used in conjunction with
            third-party layer-2 protocols and is also known as an L1 blockchain, mainnet or primary chain.


            The major issue of blockchain network scalability is primarilydue to the [proof-of-work (PoW)](https://cointelegraph.com/blockchain-for-beginners/proof-of-stake-vs-proof-of-work:-differences-explained)
            consensus mechanism adopted by layer-1 blockchains that require excessive amounts of computational resources to
            build each block of transaction data on the network.


            Moreover, the volume of transactions that a layer-1 blockchain can handle is inversely proportional to the time
            required to complete them, leading to an increase in transaction or gas fees on such networks.


            Since such layer-1 blockchains process and finalize transactions on their own blockchain, any changes to the underlying
            protocol can potentially disrupt its functioning and makes the task of changing the consensus mechanism a risky
            proposition.


            Ethereum, another layer-1 blockchain, plans to [transition from its PoW consensus mechanism](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/ethereum-upgrades-a-beginners-guide-to-eth-2-0)
            to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model in a bid to thwart this scalability concern. While this will reduce computational
            requirements and improve the blockchain’s energy efficiency, it does rely on [layer-1 scaling solutions](https://cointelegraph.com/explained/sharding-explained)
            such as sharding to eventually scale to 100,000 transactions per second.


            Sharding, the more popular of the two layer-1 scaling solutions, involves splitting up transactions into small
            data sets and then using a horizontally split processing algorithm to parallelly process them.


            However, with validation power being given to the largest stakeholders in a PoS consensus model, it does result
            in the form of centralization that needs addressing, especially for financial applications.


            ## What is a layer-2 blockchain network and why is it needed?


            There is no doubt that despite the scalability and speed handicaps of layer-1 blockchains, their rising popularity
            and the ensuing ample liquidity have led to the birth of layer-2 blockchain solutions like [Ethereum-based Polygon
            blockchain](https://cointelegraph.com/blockchain-for-beginners/polygon-blockchain-explained-a-beginners-guide-to-matic)
            or the [Bitcoin-based Lightning Network](https://cointelegraph.com/bitcoin-for-beginners/what-is-the-lightning-network-in-bitcoin-and-how-does-it-work).


            These layer-2, or L2 blockchain, solutions enable thousands of low-value transactions to be processed after validation
            on parallel blockchains, with records then being transferred to the main blockchain, or mainnet, to ensure that
            they are immutably recorded.


            Originally coined as a collective term to describe a specific set of Ethereum scaling solutions, layer-2 solutions
            were intended to cater to demand exceeding the blockchain’s 1+ million transactions per day capacity.


            Today, these secondary blockchains are expanding use cases to provide a more superlative end-user experience by
            virtue of higher transactions per second, lower gas fees and the assurance that all transactions, once completed,
            are irreversibly recorded on the mainnet.


            By ensuring that the mainnet handles critical aspects of decentralization, data availability and security, L2
            blockchain solutions are effectively diverting the transactional burden onto their parallel network and de-congesting
            the mainnet in the process.


            This solves the scaling problem plaguing layer-1 blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum while ensuring robust decentralized
            security standards are accessible to a wide range of [decentralized applications (DApps)](https://cointelegraph.com/defi-101/what-are-dapps-everything-there-is-to-know-about-decentralized-applications)
            that are getting pervasive today.


            ## Ethereum Rollups as layer-2 scaling solutions


            Rollups, termed because they “roll-up,” or packet multiple transactions into a single mainnet transaction, are
            layer-2 scaling solutions that ultimately inherit the security provided by Ethereum. They are further classified
            into two types depending on how the eventual transaction data is recorded on the layer-1 blockchain.


            The first is Optimistic Rollups, which are blockchains that sit parallel to the main chain and avoid the computation
            that makes Ethereum expensive. Essentially assuming all posted transactions to be valid, they offer security by
            being able to run fault proofs in the event of an invalid transaction being suspected.


            The second type is zero-knowledge Rollups, or zk-Rollups, that instead employ validity proofs to compute transactions
            off-chain and subsequently compress hundreds of transactions before posting cryptographic validity proofs on the
            Ethereum mainnet.


            The key difference between the two types is that validating a block is much faster on zero-knowledge Rollups,
            as they only need the validity proof instead of all transaction data, as is the case with Optimistic Rollups.


            ![Optimistic rollups vs. Zero-knowledge rollups](https://s3.cointelegraph.com/storage/uploads/view/1d94bdb4db6436e2e35d1283d50be80e.png)


            Zk-rollups provide near-zero delays in cryptocurrency fund transfer from layer-2 to layer-1 chain and make them
            more suitable for financial transactions-related use cases, as seen with the popular layer-2 crypto network Polygon.


            On the other hand, Optimistic Rollups ensure a higher degree of security and decentralization since transaction
            data is stored on the layer-1 blockchain and are more suitable for applications with minimum on-chain activity.
            They also enjoy complete [Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)](https://cointelegraph.com/ethereum-for-beginners/what-is-ethereum-a-beginners-guide-to-eth-cryptocurrency)
            and Solidity compatibility, making it possible to do everything on an Optimistic Rollup that is possible on the
            Ethereum blockchain.


            ## Demystifying other popular types of L2 scaling solutions


            [Sidechains](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sidechains_can_it_be_true) are separate blockchains that operate independently
            with their own consensus mechanisms but also run in parallel to the Ethereum mainnet with a two-way bridge connecting
            both blockchains.


            They offer developers the same feel of the Ethereum mainnet and the ability to deploy their DApps on these sidechains
            with relative ease. However, since they use a separate consensus mechanism, sidechains aren’t technically layer-2
            blockchains because they have a lower degree of decentralization built into their protocol.


            Another example of a bi-directional blockchain type is a State channel, also [referred](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/state-channels/)
            to as a payment channel, in which crypto funds are deposited in a smart contract on the layer-1 blockchain, and
            signed tickets are produced on the former. Available on both the Bitcoin and Ethereum mainnet, popular examples
            include the Lightning Network, which lets users transact speedily off-chain and records the final data back to
            the Bitcoin mainnet later. Raiden Network is another state channel that [works](https://raiden.network/) with
            the Ethereum blockchain and also permits users to run smart contracts through them.


            Plasma chains are anchored to the Ethereum mainnet and use fraud proofs, similar to Optimistic Rollups, to check
            for transaction validity in case of a dispute. They are more preferred in scenarios where transactions are done
            between arbitrary users at high speeds with lower gas fees.


            However, withdrawals from these blockchains take several days to provide for arbitration claims and involve an
            additional capital cost in cases where liquidity is [sought for fungible assets](https://cointelegraph.com/nonfungible-tokens-for-beginners/fungible-vs-nonfungible-tokens-what-is-the-difference#:~:text=A%20fungible%20token%20can%20also,unique%2C%20non%2Dreplicable%20item.).


            Nested blockchains are again similar to plasma chains but involve multiple interconnected secondary chains that
            run on top of the layer-1 blockchain. Forming a parent-child relationship, nested blockchains distribute work
            to these secondary or child chains and rely on the underlying mainnet to set parameters for the overall network
            web.


            Validiums are eerily similar to zero-knowledge rollups in the sense that they are not vulnerable to cyber-attacks
            and enjoy no delays when withdrawing funds off these blockchains. They do, however, require high amounts of computational
            power and are not cost-effective for use cases with low throughput.


            ## Layer-1 vs. layer-2 blockchains


            Despite layer-1 scaling solutions like making consensus protocol changes and sharding attempting to make blockchains
            like Bitcoin and Ethereum more scalable, they are still a work in progress with multiple projects currently working
            on bringing to market user-friendly solutions.


            Both methods, however,are trying to solve the “scalability trilemma,” a term coined by Ethereum founder Vitalik
            Buterin that alludes to the unsolved problem in distributed ledger technology based networks where every node
            that validates transactions cannot simultaneously achieve decentralization, security and scalability.


            While the jury is still out on how successful these could be, layer-2 solutions are already facilitating transaction
            speeds and fees that are ideal for scaling the blockchain ecosystem so as to unleash the full potential of this
            path-breaking technology.


            Numerous DApps are already employing these solutions to provide previously impossible experiences in the spheres
            of gaming, [Decentralized Finance (DeFi)](https://cointelegraph.com/defi-101#:~:text=Decentralized%20finance%20(DeFi)%20is%20a,on%20providing%20decentralized%20financial%20services.&text=Depositing%20your%20cryptocurrency%20onto%20a,a%20passive%20income%20through%20DeFi.)
            and the [Metaverse](https://cointelegraph.com/metaverse-for-beginners/what-is-metaverse-in-blockchain-a-beginners-guide-on-an-internet-enabled-virtual-world),
            in addition to overhauling traditional sectors like finance, corporate governance, auditing and many more.


            Despite the advantages, the way these blockchains validate transactions needs to be evaluated based on the use
            case, and the possibility of validators on the layer-2 blockchain committing fraud needs to be analyzed carefully.
            That said, new layer-2 scaling solutions are being developed constantly and this space will continue to attract
            a lot of attention, plaudits and criticism.


            ## Future of L2 blockchains


            As blockchain technology continues to witness rising real-world adoption, the focus on scalability, fast transaction
            speeds and low gas fees will drive developments across both L1 and L2 blockchains. With L1 blockchains like Ethereum
            promising to bring important updates like changes to the consensus mechanism and introducing methods like sharding,
            it will have a magnified impact on L2 blockchains that are linked to them.


            L2 blockchains will inadvertently be able to offer even faster transaction times and bring down costs to a level
            hitherto seen before. These advantages, coupled with the proliferation of L2 blockchains, will undoubtedly power
            the rise of new applications, especially in the DeFi space.


            Moreover, by virtue of more bridges being built between the various L2 blockchain platforms, users will be able
            to enjoy the benefits of higher blockchain interoperability and open up new avenues with respect to areas such
            as the trading of digital assets.


            Thus, L2 scaling solutions will play a key role in promoting a multichain world and this will put the onus on
            developers to ensure that growth is sustained without any compromises on the tenets of security, decentralization
            and scalability that blockchains are known for.


            The entire crypto industry at large will have to join forces, constantly innovate and collaborate with each other
            to bring to market L2 scaling solutions and DApps that will help the world transition to a decentralized economy.

            Aug 13, 2025, 9:00 AM ET


            _Taiko''s first phase of preconfirmations opens up more possibilities for based rollup development with faster
            transaction times without compromising Ethereum''s decentralized principles_


            NEW YORK and LONDON and SINGAPORE, Aug. 13, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- [Taiko](https://taiko.xyz/), the first-ever based
            rollup scaling Ethereum, has successfully initiated phase one of its preconfirmation system on the Ethereum mainnet,
            with the rollout taking place between 11–13 August to a permissioned whitelist of preconfirmers. This milestone
            improves transaction predictability and overall usability of based rollups, bringing them closer to becoming a
            truly viable, decentralized option for Ethereum scaling.


            [![(PRNewsfoto/Taiko)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2311006/taiko_logo_black_Logo.jpg)](https://mma.prnewswire.com/media/2311006/taiko_logo_black_Logo.html)


            With the rollout of phase one of preconfirmations, Taiko delivers transaction times of approximately 2 seconds
            while maintaining complete decentralization, opening unprecedented possibilities for DeFi, GameFi, and enterprise
            applications that previously required choosing between speed and decentralization.


            **Breaking the Blockchain Trilemma**


            For years, the blockchain industry has grappled with a seemingly impossible choice: fast, centralized rollups
            that compromise on decentralization, or slower, decentralized solutions that sacrifice performance. Preconfirmation
            technology breaks this pattern.


            "We are proud to bring preconfirmations to mainnet and further exemplify how based rollups are the best solution
            to scaling Ethereum. With preconfirmations, we will be able to see a new generation of dApps and overall Ethereum
            development that doesn''t rely on centralized payoff or compromise to achieve its goals. Developers and users
            can now achieve both decentralization and scale without compromise. This is the first time decentralization can
            meet secure, speedy performance on Ethereum," _said [Joaquin Mendes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaquin-mendes-izard/),
            COO of Taiko Labs._


            Based rollups, which utilize Ethereum''s own validators rather than centralized sequencers, represent the purest
            form of Ethereum scaling. However, they have historically been constrained by Ethereum''s 12-second block times.
            Preconfirmation technology enables near-instant transaction finality while preserving the trust-minimized nature
            that makes Ethereum uniquely valuable.


            **Industry Collaboration Drives Innovation**


            Taiko has been working with [Chainbound](https://chainbound.io/), [Gattaca](https://gattaca.com/) and [N](https://www.nethermind.io/)
            [ethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/) to ensure preconfirmations work effectively for its network, introducing
            real speed, without trust, to Ethereum.


            "It''s exciting to see the first implementation of based rollups go live on Taiko. Our significant testing and
            efforts have gone toward ensuring a viable implementation of this key development that will not only benefit Taiko
            users but the Ethereum ecosystem overall," _said [Kubi Mensah](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kubimensah/?originalSubdomain=uk),_
            _CEO and Co-Founder of Gattaca._


            This speed improvement brings based rollups further than other scaling solutions in addressing the blockchain
            trilemma. As a true extension of Ethereum, they inherit the same security and decentralization, and now can match
            centralized rollups with transaction scaling.


            "With preconfirmations, we can scale Ethereum without compromising its core principles. After putting in time
            to ensure security concerns are addressed, we are happy with the outcome of this launch with Taiko," _said [Tomasz
            Stańczak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomaszkajetanstanczak/?originalSubdomain=uk), Founder of Nethermind._


            For developers, preconfirmations mean no longer having to sacrifice ownership over the outcomes for their project
            for the sake of efficiency. It removes the risk of the centralized L2 undermining their sequencers for any number
            of reasons.


            "It''s great to see a new stepping stone in Ethereum development go live. With preconfirmations, we can make transactions
            feel seamless without introducing new trust assumptions. This is a natural next step to bring Ethereum''s scaling
            in line with its original ethos, ensuring the best outcomes for users, developers, and validators," _said [Fr](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-mosterts-014209166/)
            [ancesco Mosterts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-mosterts-014209166/), Co-Founder of Chainbound._


            **The Path Forward**


            While Taiko''s architecture enables this historic combination of decentralization and performance by design, the
            ecosystem continues to evolve. This launch marks phase one of Taiko''s preconfirmation rollout, starting with
            a permissioned set of preconfirmations. Phase two, which will introduce a permissionless preconfirmation mechanism,
            will follow at a later stage. Together, these phases represent the first steps toward a fully realized vision
            of scalable, decentralized blockchain infrastructure.

            [Ethereum US Dollar\\

            \\

            -3.60%](https://za.investing.com/crypto/ethereum/eth-usd)


            Over the last six months, Ethereum outperformed Bitcoin having gained 67% in value vs Bitcoin’s modest 20% performance.
            While Bitcoin is in its own category as digital gold, without the pseudo-scarcity of gold, Ethereum functions
            as a smart contract workhorse.


            From Ethereum’s inception to the transition from proof-of-work to proof-of-stake, the blockchain expands from
            Bitcoin’s long-term monetary anchor into a programmable economy. Ultimately, any existing financial service could
            be made into a decentralized application (dApp) – automated, running 24/7, and trustless.


            However, the network effect made Bitcoin one of a kind. No other coin can approach its security owing to the network’s
            proof-of-work and difficulty adjustment. In addition to minimalism, immutability and conservative feature expansion,
            this makes Bitcoin’s price largely reliant on macro conditions.


            The same cannot be said of Ethereum, which has many contenders for the same decentralized finance (DeFi) position
            alongside design philosophy considerations. In this light, how should potential investors view [ETH](https://za.investing.com/crypto/ethereum/eth-usd)
            exposure?


            ## **Ethereum’s Network Effect Is Both Substantial and Vulnerable**


            Just as Bitcoin has its dominance over the entire crypto market at 58%, Ethereum reigns to an even greater extent
            within DeFi blockchains at 61.3%. According to DefiLlama data, $96.6 billion worth of assets are locked in Ethereum’s
            smart contracts. This level of activity is now closing in on the peak bull era in early November 2021, at just
            over $108 billion.


            For comparison, the next largest DeFi chain – Solana – has only $11.2 billion total value locked (TVL).

            or **[remove ads](https://za.investing.com/ad-free-subscription?source=desktop&medium=article_ad)**.


            In addition to having a first mover advantage within DeFi, Ethereum accomplished this by serving as an expansion
            core. Namely, by scaling network bandwidth with a wide range of layer 2 networks such as Coinbase’s Base, Arbitrum,
            Polygon, Optimism, Unichain and others.


            Although they introduced another layer of complexity for the end-user, by having to bridge tokens and switch networks,
            these scaling solutions effectively negated Ethereum’s congestion issues and volatile transaction fees.


            Simultaneously, the same network effect makes Ethereum the top target for hacks and smart contract exploits. According
            to the H1 2025 Hack3d report from CertiK cybersecurity firm, Ethereum suffered $1.6 billion worth of losses in
            this period across 175 hacks and vulnerability exploits.


            Moreover, the complexity of just navigating through Ethereum’s ecosystem – user error – has resulted in a cumulative
            loss of $3.43 billion worth of ETH, as the most conservative estimate by researcher Conor Grogan.


            It’s safe to say these figures boost confidence in minimalist Bitcoin, but also in slower-paced alternative blockchains
            like Cardano, which adopted a peer-review vetting mechanism for its roadmap. Ultimately, Ethereum’s roadmap includes
            both layer 1 scalability through sharding and account abstraction to remove the middleware complexity for end-users.


            ## **Ethereum’s Supply Elasticity**


            Although 120.7 million ETH is in circulating supply, which serves as its total supply, Ethereum doesn’t have a
            fixed supply like Bitcoin. Instead, to safeguard future growth by incentivizing network validators, Ethereum has
            an elastic supply.

            or **[remove ads](https://za.investing.com/ad-free-subscription?source=desktop&medium=article_ad)**.


            In a fixed supply model that Bitcoin has, network rewards are cut every four years through a halving mechanism.
            In that model, Bitcoin’s security funding is offset by BTC price appreciation.


            Ethereum scales its network security budget dynamically. Presently, around 35.7 million ETH is staked to secure
            the proof-of-stake blockchain, which generates more ETH tokens. Yet, this is offset by Ethereum’s token burning
            mechanism, as programmed scarcity.


            Consequently, Ethereum’s inflation rate is roughly the same as Bitcoin’s, at around 0.74% per year, both of which
            are significantly lower than the Federal Reserve’s ideal inflationary target for the dollar at 2%. Despite its
            user error and hacking issues, this makes Ethereum a viable DeFi infrastructure layer that combines smart contract
            versatility with sound money.


            Nonetheless, ETH price is still reliant on market cycles.


            ## **Ethereum’s Negative Profitability and MVRV Signal**


            According to TokenTerminal, Ethereum has 2 million active monthly users across thousands of dApps, which maintains
            the highest level of developer activity in the crypto space. However, much like a company in its initial growth
            phase, the Ethereum network is not profitable due to repeated token incentives to spur activity.


            If we were to liken the Ethereum network to a company, its ETH dynamic supply would be akin to issuing new shares
            to fund security when the business slows down. Likewise, token-burning would be akin to share buybacks, as the
            reduction of the total ETH supply.

            Ethereum’s core revenue comes from transaction fees (gas), ETH staking rewards and maximal extractable value (MEV),
            as an “advanced” revenue stream for block producers when they reorder or insert transactions.


            These three components shape Ethereum’s actual value, or Market Value to Realized Value ratio (MVRV). Typically,
            when MVRV is above a ratio of 3.0, this signals the market top, followed by a sell-off. In early August, Ethereum’s
            MVRV reached 2.0, signaling a few more months of bullishness before the inevitable market correction.


            ## **Ethereum Likely to Exceed Its Prior Top**


            Looking back at the last four years of the Biden admin, it is clear that the crypto space was under heavy assault.
            This not only came from Gary Gensler’s SEC but also from underhanded de-banking practices within the Federal Reserve
            system. Consequently, such policies suppressed enthusiasm across the entire crypto ecosystem.


            Early into the Trump admin, it has been equally clear there is a departure from this hostile institutional stance.
            A strong indicator for this is the rising capital inflow into corporate Ether treasuries.


            According to Strategic ETH Reserve tracker, there is now 3.6 million ETH, worth around $16.6 billion, across 72
            entities. Similar to spot-traded Bitcoin ETFs spurring institutional exposure, the same is likely to happen to
            ETH.


            Potential investors should also consider the recently passed Genius Act, signaling a new era of stablecoins. Ethereum
            is by far the largest facilitator of diversified stablecoin traffic at a $138 billion market cap, followed by
            the Tron network at $83 billion, which is dominated almost entirely by USDT.

            or **[remove ads](https://za.investing.com/ad-free-subscription?source=desktop&medium=article_ad)**.


            Combined with Ethereum’s elastic supply, but low inflation rate, and a wide range of DeFi use cases, it is easy
            to see why ETH price is likely to surpass its previous all-time high of $4,891 in November 2021. According to
            Fundstrat’s Digital Asset Research, analysts Tom Lee and Sean Farrell forecast $10,000 per ETH by the end of 2025.


            Of course, there is also likely to be a major sell-off as the MVRV ratio goes up. Nonetheless, in the crypto-friendlier
            era, this should only serve as another buy-the-dip opportunity.

            Taiko has launched the first phase of pre-confirmation, accelerating the transaction confirmation speed on the
            mainnet while adhering to the principles of decentralization, opening a new chapter for the development of Based
            Rollup.


            As the first Based Rollup built on Ethereum''s native mechanism, [Taiko](https://taiko.xyz/) has successfully
            launched the first phase of the pre-confirmation mechanism on the Ethereum mainnet. This deployment will gradually
            open to authorized pre-confirmation whitelist addresses between August 11 and 13. This milestone significantly
            enhances the transaction predictability and overall usability of Based Rollup, propelling Taiko to become a truly
            viable and decentralized Ethereum scaling solution.


            With the launch of the first phase of pre-confirmation, Taiko achieves an approximate 2-second transaction confirmation
            time while maintaining complete decentralization principles. This brings new possibilities for DeFi, GameFi, and
            enterprise-level applications, eliminating the need to choose between speed and decentralization.


            ### Breaking the Blockchain Trilemma


            For a long time, the blockchain industry has struggled between fast but centralized Rollups and decentralized
            but slower solutions. The pre-confirmation technology completely breaks this inherent model of "either speed or
            decentralization."


            Taiko Labs Chief Operating Officer [Joaquin Mendes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joaquin-mendes-izard/) stated:


            "We are very proud to bring the pre-confirmation feature to the mainnet, once again proving that Based Rollup
            is the best solution for scaling Ethereum. With the pre-confirmation mechanism, we will see the development of
            a new generation of dApps and the Ethereum ecosystem no longer relying on centralized means or compromising with
            them. Now, developers and users no longer have to sacrifice decentralization principles to achieve both decentralization
            and scalability. Decentralization has finally achieved a true combination with secure and efficient performance."


            Based Rollup utilizes Ethereum''s own validators rather than centralized sequencers, representing the purest form
            of Ethereum scaling. However, it has been previously hindered by Ethereum''s 12-second block time. Now, pre-confirmation
            technology allows transactions to approach instant confirmation while retaining the core value of Ethereum''s
            "minimal trust" mechanism.


            ### Industry Collaboration Drives Innovation


            To ensure the smooth operation of the pre-confirmation feature on the network, Taiko has closely collaborated
            with teams such as [Chainbound](https://chainbound.io/), [Gattaca](https://gattaca.com/), and [Nethermind](https://www.nethermind.io/)
            to bring "trustless real speed" to Ethereum.


            Gattaca co-founder and CEO Kubi Mensah stated:


            "We are very pleased to see Based Rollup successfully launched on the Taiko mainnet for the first time. We conducted
            extensive testing to ensure this critical innovation can be implemented stably, benefiting not only Taiko''s users
            but also driving the development of the entire Ethereum ecosystem."


            This speed enhancement positions Based Rollup ahead of other scaling solutions in addressing the "blockchain trilemma."
            As a true extension of Ethereum, Taiko retains its security and decentralization advantages while achieving transaction
            performance comparable to centralized Rollups.


            Nethermind founder [Tomasz Stańczak](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomaszkajetanstanczak/?originalSubdomain=uk)
            stated:


            "With the pre-confirmation mechanism, we can scale Ethereum without violating its core principles. We have thoroughly
            validated its security and are very satisfied with the results of this launch with Taiko."


            For developers, the pre-confirmation mechanism means they no longer have to relinquish control of their projects
            for efficiency, nor worry that centralized L2s will interfere with the ordering process in certain situations.


            Chainbound co-founder [Francesco Mosterts](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-mosterts-014209166/) stated:


            "I am very excited to see Ethereum''s scaling development take another important step forward. With the pre-confirmation
            mechanism, we can achieve a seamless and smooth transaction experience without introducing new trust assumptions.
            This is a key step in aligning Ethereum''s scaling with its original vision, providing a better experience for
            users, developers, and validators."


            ### Future Outlook


            Taiko''s system architecture inherently supports the combination of decentralization and high performance, but
            its ecosystem is still evolving. This launch marks the first phase of the pre-confirmation feature, currently
            involving permissioned pre-confirmers. The future second phase will introduce a permissionless and open pre-confirmation
            mechanism, realizing the complete vision of decentralized scaling.

        processed_summary: '**Ethereum Scaling Solutions**


          **Cointelegraph: A beginner''s guide on blockchain layer-2 scaling solutions** - August 8, 2025

          *   **Ethereum''s transition to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) aims to address scalability concerns, with a goal to scale
          to 100,000 transactions per second through layer-1 scaling solutions like sharding.** "Ethereum, another layer-1
          blockchain, plans to transition from its PoW consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model in a bid to thwart
          this scalability concern. While this will reduce computational requirements and improve the blockchain’s energy
          efficiency, it does rely on layer-1 scaling solutions such as sharding to eventually scale to 100,000 transactions
          per second."

          *   **Layer-2 scaling solutions were originally developed for Ethereum to handle demand exceeding its capacity of
          over 1 million transactions per day.** "Originally coined as a collective term to describe a specific set of Ethereum
          scaling solutions, layer-2 solutions were intended to cater to demand exceeding the blockchain’s 1+ million transactions
          per day capacity."

          *   **Rollups are a type of Layer-2 solution that bundle multiple transactions into a single mainnet transaction,
          inheriting Ethereum''s security.** "Rollups, termed because they “roll-up,” or packet multiple transactions into
          a single mainnet transaction, are layer-2 scaling solutions that ultimately inherit the security provided by Ethereum."

          *   **Optimistic Rollups assume transactions are valid and use fault proofs for security, offering full Ethereum
          Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solidity compatibility.** "The first is Optimistic Rollups, which are blockchains that
          sit parallel to the main chain and avoid the computation that makes Ethereum expensive. Essentially assuming all
          posted transactions to be valid, they offer security by being able to run fault proofs in the event of an invalid
          transaction being suspected... They also enjoy complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solidity compatibility,
          making it possible to do everything on an Optimistic Rollup that is possible on the Ethereum blockchain."

          *   **Zero-knowledge Rollups (zk-Rollups) use validity proofs to process transactions off-chain, compress them,
          and post cryptographic proofs to the Ethereum mainnet, offering faster block validation.** "The second type is zero-knowledge
          Rollups, or zk-Rollups, that instead employ validity proofs to compute transactions off-chain and subsequently compress
          hundreds of transactions before posting cryptographic validity proofs on the Ethereum mainnet. The key difference
          between the two types is that validating a block is much faster on zero-knowledge Rollups, as they only need the
          validity proof instead of all transaction data, as is the case with Optimistic Rollups."

          *   **Other Layer-2 scaling solutions include Sidechains, State Channels (like Raiden Network for Ethereum), Plasma
          Chains, Nested Blockchains, and Validiums.** "Sidechains are separate blockchains that operate independently with
          their own consensus mechanisms but also run in parallel to the Ethereum mainnet with a two-way bridge connecting
          both blockchains... Another example of a bi-directional blockchain type is a State channel, also referred to as
          a payment channel... Raiden Network is another state channel that works with the Ethereum blockchain and also permits
          users to run smart contracts through them. Plasma chains are anchored to the Ethereum mainnet and use fraud proofs,
          similar to Optimistic Rollups... Nested blockchains are again similar to plasma chains but involve multiple interconnected
          secondary chains that run on top of the layer-1 blockchain... Validiums are eerily similar to zero-knowledge rollups
          in the sense that they are not vulnerable to cyber-attacks and enjoy no delays when withdrawing funds off these
          blockchains."

          *   **Layer-2 solutions aim to solve the "scalability trilemma" by offloading transactional burden from the mainnet
          while maintaining decentralization and security.** "By ensuring that the mainnet handles critical aspects of decentralization,
          data availability and security, L2 blockchain solutions are effectively diverting the transactional burden onto
          their parallel network and de-congesting the mainnet in the process. This solves the scaling problem plaguing layer-1
          blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum while ensuring robust decentralized security standards are accessible to a
          wide range of decentralized applications (DApps) that are getting pervasive today."


          **WIVB.com: Taiko Opens Up the Next Era of Ethereum with Preconfirmations on Mainnet** - August 13, 2025

          *   **Taiko, the first based rollup, has launched phase one of its preconfirmation system on the Ethereum mainnet,
          aiming for approximately 2-second transaction times while maintaining decentralization.** "Taiko, the first-ever
          based rollup scaling Ethereum, has successfully initiated phase one of its preconfirmation system on the Ethereum
          mainnet... With the rollout of phase one of preconfirmations, Taiko delivers transaction times of approximately
          2 seconds while maintaining complete decentralization, opening unprecedented possibilities for DeFi, GameFi, and
          enterprise applications that previously required choosing between speed and decentralization."

          *   **Based rollups utilize Ethereum''s own validators for scaling, representing a pure form of Ethereum scaling
          that was previously limited by Ethereum''s 12-second block times.** "Based rollups, which utilize Ethereum''s own
          validators rather than centralized sequencers, represent the purest form of Ethereum scaling. However, they have
          historically been constrained by Ethereum''s 12-second block times."

          *   **Preconfirmation technology enables near-instant transaction finality for based rollups while preserving Ethereum''s
          trust-minimized nature.** "Preconfirmation technology enables near-instant transaction finality while preserving
          the trust-minimized nature that makes Ethereum uniquely valuable."


          **ChainCatcher: Taiko has launched a pre-confirmation mechanism on the Ethereum mainnet, ushering in a new era of
          Ethereum scalability** - August 13, 2025

          *   **Taiko''s pre-confirmation mechanism on the Ethereum mainnet aims to significantly enhance transaction predictability
          and usability for Based Rollups, making them a more viable and decentralized scaling solution.** "This milestone
          significantly enhances the transaction predictability and overall usability of Based Rollup, propelling Taiko to
          become a truly viable and decentralized Ethereum scaling solution."

          *   **The first phase of Taiko''s pre-confirmation involves a permissioned whitelist of pre-confirmers, with a future
          phase planned for a permissionless mechanism.** "This launch marks the first phase of the pre-confirmation feature,
          currently involving permissioned pre-confirmers. The future second phase will introduce a permissionless and open
          pre-confirmation mechanism, realizing the complete vision of decentralized scaling."


          **Investing.com ZA: Ethereum''s $10K Target Back in Sight: Possible or Overblown?** - August 14, 2025

          *   **Ethereum has addressed congestion and volatile transaction fees through a wide range of layer 2 networks,
          including Coinbase’s Base, Arbitrum, Polygon, Optimism, and Unichain.** "Although they introduced another layer
          of complexity for the end-user, by having to bridge tokens and switch networks, these scaling solutions effectively
          negated Ethereum’s congestion issues and volatile transaction fees."

          *   **Ethereum''s roadmap includes both layer 1 scalability through sharding and account abstraction to simplify
          user experience.** "Ultimately, Ethereum’s roadmap includes both layer 1 scalability through sharding and account
          abstraction to remove the middleware complexity for end-users."


          The search results are highly relevant to the query "Ethereum scaling solutions" as they extensively cover various
          Layer-1 and Layer-2 scaling methods, with a particular focus on rollups and recent developments like Taiko''s preconfirmation
          system.'

            #### What to know:


            - Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent appeared to reverse course Thursday, saying the government remains committed
            to adding to its bitcoin holdings in a budget-neutral way.

            - Earlier in the day, Bessent said the Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would only consist of the $15 billion to $20
            billion in coins already held, but no new purchases were being contemplated.

            - Bitcoin remained sharply lower for the day at $118,000 after touching a new record high of $124,000 in overnight
            action.

            Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent began Thursday by dashing the hopes of at least some bitcoiners, saying the Strategic
            Bitcoin Reserve would be made up of the $15 billion to $20 billion already held by the government, but [that there
            was no intention](https://protos.com/us-treasury-secretary-says-no-purchases-for-strategic-bitcoin-reserve/) of
            making any fresh purchases.


            He ended the day, however, by seemingly contradicting those remarks, [saying his department](https://x.com/SecScottBessent/status/1956080030137626887)
            is "committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire more Bitcoin to expand the reserve."

            The fresh buys would be in addition to tokens forfeited to the government, which will be the “foundation” of the
            reserve, Bessent said.


            U.S. President Donald Trump signed an executive order in March to create a strategic bitcoin reserve which Bessent
            has advocated for. Earlier this month, Bo Hines, the leader of the White House''s Council of Advisors on Digital
            Assets — whose tasks, among other things, [included the SBR](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/07/30/trump-s-top-crypto-guys-u-s-defi-will-thrive-assures-bitcoin-reserve-is-coming)

            continued to trade at about $118,000 late in the U.S. afternoon Thursday, down sharply since hitting a new record
            high of $124,000 just hours earlier.


            The bulk of the decline came after [a far stronger than anticipated](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/14/crypto-prices-quickly-slide-after-troubling-u-s-ppi-report)
            Producer Price Index report, which called into question the idea that inflation is receding enough for the Federal
            Reserve to trim interest rates in September.

            ![Polygon’s POL token slid 8% to $0.24 Thursday after breaking key support, as surging U.S. wholesale inflation

            What to know:

            - Trading volume spiked to 1.1 million units — more than triple its daily average — after a sharp rejection at
            the $0.26 resistance level.

            - The CoinDesk 20 Index fell 4% over the same period, with profit-taking accelerating across major cryptocurrencies.

            # Crypto Prices Quickly Slide After Troubling U.S. PPI Report


            ## Inflation at wholesale level in the U.S. in July sped up far beyond economist forecasts, calling into question
            expectations for lower interest rates.

            #### What to know:


            - July PPI surged 0.9% month-over-month and 3.3% year-over-year, both well above forecasts, reducing expectations
            for near-term Fed rate cuts.

            - Bitcoin and ether quickly tumbled, leading crypto markets sharply lower in wake of the data.

            Inflation concerns were re-ignited during U.S. morning hours Thursday, sending risk assets — crypto among them
            — sharply lower.


            The July Producer Price Index (PPI) rose 0.9%, blowing past estimates for 0.2% and 0.0% in June. On a year-over-year
            basis, PPI was higher by 3.3% versus forecasts for 2.5% and June''s 2.4%.

            Core PPI, which excludes food and energy, also surged 0.9% in July, far exceeding the 0.2% expected and 0.0% in
            June. Core CPI year-over-year rose 3.7% against 2.9% expected and 2.6% in June.


            Already well off a record high hit overnight above $124,000, bitcoin


            [BTC$117,993.50](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin)


            tumbled below $119,000 on the news. Ether (ETH) plunged nearly 4% to $4,550. Other recently red-hot altcoins like
            solana


            [SOL$195.01](https://www.coindesk.com/price/solana)


            and XRP


            [XRP$3.0807](https://www.coindesk.com/price/xrp)


            were similarly struck.


            Fresh labor market data provided no relief, with initial jobless claims for the week ending August 9 at 224,000,
            slightly below the 228,000 expected, and continuing claims holding at 1.95 million. The still-tight labor market,
            combined with the strong PPI readings, reinforced the view that the Fed may keep interest rates elevated for longer
            to tame inflation.


            [According to CME FedWatch](https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/cme-fedwatch-tool.html), the previous
            100% chance for a September rate cut slipped to 96% in wake of the fresh data.


            In traditional markets, U.S. stock index futures have slipped 0.5%, the dollar is gaining ground and the 10-year
            U.S. Treasury yield moved higher by five basis points to 4.25%.

            Crypto Slide Spurs $1B Leverage Flush, But It''s a Healthy Pullback, Analysts Say

            ![White froth-tipped waves (Dimitris Vetsikas/Pixabay)](https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2Fb5c30adde39d74c27e831f8400fa198ddb0528d0-5164x2904.jpg%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)


            Market strategists said the crypto rally’s broader outlook remains positive despite the largest long liquidations
            since early August.


            What to know:


            - Bitcoin’s pullback from record highs to $118,000 rippled through the crypto market, triggering over $1 billion
            liquidations across digital assets.

            - The sell-off marks a healthy profit-taking, not a reversal, as Fed rate-cut hopes and ETF inflows still support
            bullish momentum, analysts said.

            - Rising core inflation data and stretched valuations pose near-term risks, but institutional demand for crypto
            remains strong.

            #### What to know:


            - Bitcoin surged past its previous record, surpassing $124,000, as it mirrored a rally in U.S. equities.

            - The cryptocurrency became the fifth-largest asset by market capitalization, overtaking Google''s $2.4 trillion.

            - Analysts are now eyeing $135,000–$138,000 as the next potential target for Bitcoin.

            Bitcoin


            [BTC$118,386.12](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin)


            surged past its previous record on Wednesday, rallying in tandem with U.S. equities as investors continued piled
            into risk assets ahead of key macro catalysts.


            BTC rose above $124,000 in early Asia trading on Thursday, topping the July 14 high of $123,205, before seeing
            slight profit taking. The move came as the S&P 500 logged its second consecutive record close, meaning BTC mirrored
            a rally in stocks as both markets feed off the same bullish macro backdrop.

            It became the fifth-largest asset by market capitalization across all assets, [data shows](https://companiesmarketcap.com/assets-by-market-cap/),
            crossing Google’s $2.4 trillion.


            The milestone reflects a year-long build in bullish sentiment, fueled by a friendlier regulatory backdrop under
            President Donald Trump and the rapid adoption of corporate treasury strategies centered on bitcoin accumulation.


            Michael Saylor’s Strategy (MSTR) pioneered the playbook of stockpiling BTC as a balance sheet asset, a move now
            mirrored by smaller public companies — and increasingly, by Ether proponents.


            The result has been broad-based strength across top digital assets, with bitcoin’s market capitalization climbing
            to $2.46 trillion and Ether’s to nearly $575 billion, according to CoinGecko. Together, the two dominate roughly
            70% of all crypto trading activity.


            The rally is also riding a wave of macro optimism. U.S. inflation data this week landed in line with expectations,
            reinforcing bets that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates in September.


            Lower borrowing costs tend to boost valuations for riskier assets by easing financial conditions, creating a spillover
            from blue-chip equities into high-volatility corners like crypto.


            With bitcoin now firmly above the $120,000 resistance zone, some technical analysts are eyeing $135,000–$138,000
            as the next upside target, as CoinDesk [reported earlier](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/12/bitcoin-traders-eye-usd135k-ether-usd4-800-in-crosshairs-as-cpi-looms)
            in the week.

            By [CD Analytics](https://www.coindesk.com/author/coindesk-analytics), [Oliver Knight](https://www.coindesk.com/author/oliver-knight)


            11 minutes ago


            !["ATOM cryptocurrency price chart shows sharp intraday decline from $4.91 to $4.49 on high-volume selloff exceeding
            5.6 million units, followed by partial recovery establishing support near $4.60."](https://www.coindesk.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.sanity.io%2Fimages%2Fs3y3vcno%2Fproduction%2F357df676c2fd3bf80bdb44662691576e7898e174-700x430.png%3Fauto%3Dformat&w=3840&q=75)


            ATOM-USD rebounded sharply from a midday selloff, with heavy volume and fresh support at $4.60 signaling renewed
            buyer confidence, even as resistance at $4.91 remains unbroken.


            What to know:


            - ATOM-USD traded between $4.49 and $4.91 over the 24-hour period, with volume spiking to 5.62M units—322% above
            average—signaling intense market activity and possible capitulation during a sharp midday selloff to $4.53.

            - Buyers stepped in post-selloff to establish a firm support base near $4.60, stabilizing prices and restoring
            confidence in the Cosmos ecosystem.

            - The asset consolidated between $4.59–$4.62 during the recovery phase, with $4.60 as critical support and $4.91
            remaining the main resistance target.

            # Who Is Cashing Out of Bitcoin at Record Highs Above $120K?


            ## BTC hit record highs above $124,000 early today, but the momentum has quickly faded consistent with the pattern
            seen since mid-July.

            Who is selling BTC at record highs? (Stone\_WLP/Pixabay)


            #### What to know:


            - Long-term holders have accelerated their selling, impacting market momentum, according to observers.

            - Blockchain data reveals a decline of over 300,000 BTC held by long-term wallets in the past four weeks, with
            dormant wallets becoming active.

            - Institutional call overwriting has led to reduced volatility, while strong demand at $118,000 levels supports
            the market amid macroeconomic tailwinds.


            Since mid-July, bitcoin''s (BTC) ascent has slowed above $120,000. Prices hit a new high of $124,157 early Thursday
            but have since pulled back to $123,000, lacking momentum.


            This raises a question: who is cashing out of bitcoin and adding selling pressure to the market? According to
            observers, the answer lies in blockchain data, which shows old wallets have been liquidating their holdings.

            "It may be linked to concentrated selling pressure from long-term holders who have recently accelerated their
            selling," Gabriel Halm, senior blockchain analyst at Sentora, told CoinDesk.


            "Historically, long-term holders’ selling phases are cleanly defined within the bitcoin cycle. This time, however,
            accumulation during Q2’s pullback has given way to renewed selling, suggesting the market’s structure may be shifting."


            The supply of BTC controlled by long-term holders or wallets with a history of owning coins for 155 days or more
            has declined by over 300,000 BTC in four weeks, [according to](https://www.bitcoinmagazinepro.com/charts/long-term-holder-supply/)
            data source Bitcoin Magazine.


            Several dormant wallets, inactive for over a decade, [have become active](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/sleeping-beauty-bitcoin-wallets-wake-up-after-14-years-to-the-tune-of-2-billion-79f1f11f)
            in the past four weeks, moving coins on-chain for the first time in years, possibly in profit-taking operations.


            Blockchain analytics firm Glassnode stated last week that profit-taking by long-term holders continues, albeit
            at a slower rate than in July.


            "$BTC profit realization by long-term holders (7D SMA) has slowed in August after a July run consistently above
            $1B/day - one of the largest profit-taking periods on record," Glassnode [said on X](https://x.com/glassnode/status/1954811053742719153).


            Sam Gaer, chief investment officer of Monarq Asset Management''s Directional Fund, stated that the supply from
            ancient wallets has been capping upside but has been largely absorbed well, matching the pattern seen last year
            when Germany''s Saxony state liquidated its holdings.


            "Price levels in BTC have tended to consolidate around psychological levels (think $100,000, $110,000, $120,000)
            and specifically around ATH levels. This same pattern was seen just last month at the $110,000 level as we touched
            all-time highs at the 112 area and then drifted lower several times," Gaer said.


            The persistent selling of higher strike calls by institutions could have influenced the rally speed. They typically
            do so to earn an additional yield on top of spot market holdings. According to Gaer, the so-called call overwriting
            has led to a volatility meltdown. Implied volatility, which represents expected price turbulence over a specific
            period, is driven by demand for options.


            "Call overwriting activity by long-term holders continues in a seemingly unabated fashion, with a vol crush that’s
            left BTC with weekend vols in the teens- unheard of in my experience. I use the phrase ''40 is the new 60'' when
            referencing the overall BTC \[implied\] volatility repricing– this is a historical sign of a market maturing,"
            Gaer said.


            ## What next?


            The path of least resistance remains upside, thanks to signs of strong dip-demand and macroeconomic tailwinds.


            "1.88 million addresses bought 1.3 million BTC at an average of $118,000, indicating a strong layer of demand
            that has so far prevented a deeper pullback," Halm told CoinDesk.


            Speaking of macro, the market is [increasingly getting comfortable with](https://www.coindesk.com/daybook-us/2025/08/13/risk-on-rules-as-cpi-fails-to-dent-rally-crypto-daybook-americas)
            the idea that the new normal inflation in the post-COVID world is well above the Fed''s 2% target and expects
            the central bank to cut rates in September.


            Steve Gregory, founder of Vtrader, expects renewed rotation of funds into bitcoin from ether.


            "We may see a rotation back to bitcoin and a break of the $120,000 level as bitcoin''s 3-month volatility hit
            its lowest since September 2023. Furthermore, 95% of ETH wallets are now in profit, indicating that traders may
            make a logical rotation back to BTC," Gregory said.

        processed_summary: '**The U.S. government is considering purchasing more Bitcoin for its Strategic Bitcoin Reserve.**
          Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent stated his department is "committed to exploring budget-neutral pathways to acquire
          more Bitcoin to expand the reserve." This contradicts an earlier statement where he said the reserve would only
          consist of existing holdings of $15 billion to $20 billion, with no new purchases planned. U.S. President Donald
          Trump signed an executive order in March to create this strategic bitcoin reserve. Bitcoin was trading around $118,000
          after reaching a new record high of $124,000 earlier. The decline was attributed to a stronger than anticipated
          Producer Price Index report, which reduced expectations for a September interest rate cut. https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/14/u-s-confirms-plans-to-purchase-bitcoin-for-strategic-reserve-after-policy-shift
          (August 14, 2025, 4:40 p.m.)


          **Bitcoin''s price quickly slid after a troubling U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) report.** The July PPI rose 0.9%
          month-over-month and 3.3% year-over-year, both exceeding forecasts, which diminished expectations for near-term
          Federal Reserve rate cuts. Bitcoin tumbled below $119,000 from an overnight record high above $124,000. The still-tight
          labor market, combined with strong PPI readings, suggests the Fed may keep interest rates elevated longer to control
          inflation. CME FedWatch data showed the probability of a September rate cut slipped to 96% from 100% after the data.

          **Bitcoin''s market capitalization surpassed Google''s, making it the fifth-largest asset globally.** Bitcoin surged
          past its previous record, topping $124,000 in early Asia trading on Thursday, exceeding its July 14 high of $123,205
          before a slight pullback. This milestone, crossing Google''s $2.4 trillion market cap, reflects a year-long bullish
          sentiment driven by a more favorable regulatory environment under President Donald Trump and the increasing adoption
          of corporate treasury strategies focused on Bitcoin accumulation. Analysts are now looking at $135,000–$138,000
          as the next target for Bitcoin. The rally is also fueled by macroeconomic optimism, as U.S. inflation data aligned
          with expectations, strengthening bets for a Federal Reserve interest rate cut in September. https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/14/bitcoin-crosses-google-to-become-fifth-largest-asset-as-fed-rate-cut-bets-rise

          **Long-term Bitcoin holders have been increasing their selling activity, contributing to the recent lack of momentum
          above $120,000.** Bitcoin hit a new high of $124,157 early Thursday but has since retreated to $123,000, with observers
          noting accelerated selling by long-term holders. Blockchain data indicates that the supply of BTC held by wallets
          owning coins for 155 days or more has decreased by over 300,000 BTC in the past four weeks, with dormant wallets
          becoming active for profit-taking. Despite this selling pressure, strong demand around the $118,000 level and macroeconomic
          tailwinds suggest the path of least resistance for Bitcoin remains upwards. Institutional call overwriting has also
          reduced volatility, with implied volatility hitting lows not seen since September 2023, which analysts see as a
          sign of market maturation. Experts anticipate a rotation of funds back into Bitcoin from Ether, especially as 95%
          of ETH wallets are now in profit. https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/14/who-is-cashing-out-of-bitcoin-at-record-highs-above-usd120k

            Ethereum''s ether

            ( [ETH](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/ethereum/)) token price climbed within striking distance of its all-time
            high today

            (Thursday), trading at $4,750 and sitting just 3% below the $4,865 peak

            reached in late 2021.


            # Ethereum Price Today Approaches Record High


            The world''s

            second-largest cryptocurrency has outpaced Bitcoin (BTC) in

            recent trading, gaining 4.5% over the past 24 hours compared to Bitcoin''s

            2.3% advance. Ether has surged 60% over the past month, hitting a

            four-year high of $4,770 during early Thursday trading.

            Market

            watchers are taking notice. Fundstrat Capital''s Thomas

            Lee called Ethereum the "biggest macro trade" for the

            next decade, pointing to artificial intelligence''s role in

            creating blockchain-based token economies and Wall Street''s

            increasing adoption of blockchain technology.


            "ETH

            is arguably the biggest macro trade for the next 10 to 15 years

            as AI creates a token economy on the blockchain and as Wall Street

            financializes on the blockchain," Lee said Wednesday.


            ## Ambitious Ethereum Price Predictions Emerge


            Fundstrat''s

            digital asset research head Sean Farrell set an aggressive

            year-end target of $12,000 to $15,000 for Ethereum price,

            suggesting "there is still plenty of upside" from

            current levels. The firm also predicted ether could reach $10,000,

            more than double its current value.

            The network commands 55% of the $25 billion real-world asset

            tokenization sector and holds the same percentage of the

            entire stablecoin market, according to RWA.xyz data.


            My

            technical analysis supports the bullish outlook. After breaking above

            the $4,000 level last week, Ethereum entered a price discovery phase

            approaching its November 2021 highs. I project the token could

            reach $7,500 based on Fibonacci extensions, with the 61.8%

            extension coinciding with the $5,000 psychological level.

            ## Why Ethereum Is Going Up? Corporate Accumulation Drives Demand


            Behind the

            scenes, institutional accumulation is removing significant

            supply from the market. [BitMine\\

            Immersion Technologies](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/ethereum-inches-toward-2021-high-as-tokenized-stocks-etfs-outpace-bitcoin-inflows/),
            chaired by Fundstrat''s Lee, has aggressively

            accumulated 1.2 million ether tokens since July, building a

            treasury worth nearly $5.5 billion. The company''s stock has

            jumped 1,300% during the same period.


            "When

            you combine record ETF inflows with corporate and sovereign

            balance sheet allocations, the result is deep structural demand

            "That''s a recipe for sustained upward pressure on prices."


            The

            broader cryptocurrency market has benefited from favorable macroeconomic

            conditions. The S&P 500 and Nasdaq hover near all-time highs,

            supported by softer inflation data and expectations for Federal

            Reserve rate cuts. Market participants see over 90%

            probability for a 25 basis point cut in September.

            ## Ethereum Price Analysis FAQ


            ### What Is the Price Prediction for Ethereum in 2025?


            Multiple

            analysts are targeting significant gains for Ethereum this year. Fundstrat''s

            research team has set the most aggressive target, predicting ether could

            reach $12,000 to $15,000 by the end of 2025. This represents a potential

            150-200% gain from current levels around $4,750.


            Technical

            analysis also supports bullish projections. With ether breaking above the

            critical $4,000 resistance level and entering price discovery mode, Fibonacci

            extensions point toward a $7,500 target. The 61.8% extension aligns with the

            psychologically important $5,000 level, making this a reasonable intermediate

            target.


            ### What Will Ethereum Be in 2030 Price Prediction?


            Long-term

            forecasts for Ethereum are exceptionally bullish, though specific 2030

            predictions vary widely among analysts. Thomas Lee from Fundstrat describes

            Ethereum as the "biggest macro trade for the next 10 to 15

            years," citing artificial intelligence''s role in creating

            blockchain-based token economies.


            Conservative

            long-term projections suggest ether could reach $20,000-$50,000 by 2030,

            assuming continued institutional adoption and technological advancement.

            However, these predictions depend heavily on successful network upgrades,

            regulatory stability, and broader cryptocurrency market maturation.


            ### Will Ethereum Hit $10,000?


            Yes,

            multiple analysts believe Ethereum will surpass $10,000, with some expecting

            this milestone within the current market cycle. Fundstrat''s Sean Farrell

            explicitly stated that ether could reach $10,000, describing this level as

            having "plenty of upside" potential.


            The path to

            $10,000 becomes more realistic when considering Ethereum''s dominant market

            position. The network controls 55% of the $25 billion real-world asset

            tokenization sector and maintains the same percentage of the entire

            stablecoin market, providing fundamental value beyond speculative trading.


            ### Will ETH Reach $5,000 in 2025?


            Reaching

            $5,000 appears highly probable in 2025, as this represents only a 5% gain from

            current levels near $4,750. In fact, ether is currently trading just 3%

            below its all-time high of $4,865, making $5,000 a conservative near-term

            target.


            Given

            Ethereum''s current trajectory, strong institutional backing, and favorable

            market conditions, reaching $5,000 in 2025 appears not just possible, but

            likely to occur within the next few months rather than by year-end.


            Ethereum''s ether

            high today

            (Thursday), trading at $4,750 and sitting just 3% below the $4,865 peak

            reached in late 2021.

            The world''s

            second-largest cryptocurrency has outpaced Bitcoin (BTC) in

            recent trading, gaining 4.5% over the past 24 hours compared to Bitcoin''s

            2.3% advance. Ether has surged 60% over the past month, hitting a

            four-year high of $4,770 during early Thursday trading.

            Market

            watchers are taking notice. Fundstrat Capital''s Thomas

            Lee called Ethereum the "biggest macro trade" for the

            next decade, pointing to artificial intelligence''s role in

            creating blockchain-based token economies and Wall Street''s

            increasing adoption of blockchain technology.


            "ETH

            is arguably the biggest macro trade for the next 10 to 15 years

            as AI creates a token economy on the blockchain and as Wall Street

            financializes on the blockchain," Lee said Wednesday.


            ## Ambitious Ethereum Price Predictions Emerge


            Fundstrat''s

            digital asset research head Sean Farrell set an aggressive

            year-end target of $12,000 to $15,000 for Ethereum price,

            suggesting "there is still plenty of upside" from

            current levels. The firm also predicted ether could reach $10,000,

            more than double its current value.

            long-term projections suggest ether could reach $20,000-$50,000 by 2030,

            assuming continued institutional adoption and technological advancement.

            However, these predictions depend heavily on successful network upgrades,

            regulatory stability, and broader cryptocurrency market maturation.

            [Damian Chmiel](https://www.financemagnates.com/author/damianc/)


            - Bitcoin price smashed through $124K to flip Google''s market cap, becoming the world''s fifth-largest asset
            by valuation.


            - Institutional adoption and Fed rate cut expectations drive analysts to predict $200K Bitcoin by end-2025.


            - Corporate treasury strategies and ETF inflows create a supply squeeze as the altcoin season signals a broader
            crypto rally.

            Why is Bitcoin surging today?



            Bitcoin price

            ( [BTC](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/bitcoin/)) has exploded to a new all-time high above $124,000, briefly
            overtaking

            Google''s market capitalization to become the world''s fifth-largest asset. With

            institutional adoption accelerating and Federal Reserve rate cuts on the

            horizon, analysts are now targeting $200,000 by year-end 2025.


            The

            cryptocurrency''s meteoric rise reflects a **fundamental shift** in

            how institutions view digital assets: no longer as speculative investments but

            as strategic treasury assets and inflation hedges.


            # Bitcoin Price Hits New ATH And Overtakes Tech Giant


            Bitcoin

            achieved a **groundbreaking milestone** on August 14, 2025, when

            its market capitalization briefly surpassed Google''s $2.45 trillion valuation.

            This historic moment represents more than just a price milestone, it signals

            While some may still be wondering what is Bitcoin, who created Bitcoin, or how does Bitcoin work, one thing is
            certain: Bitcoin has changed the world.No one can remain indifferent to this revolutionary, decentralized, digital
            asset nor to its blockchain technology.In fact, we’ve gone a long way ever since a Florida resident Laszlo Hanyecz

            **[$2.46 trillion](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/crypto-market-cap-nears-41-trillion-amid-us-approval-for-401k-plans/)**,

            placing it among the world''s most valuable assets alongside companies like

            Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia. This achievement validates years of institutional

            adoption and regulatory progress that have transformed Bitcoin from a niche

            digital experiment into a globally recognized store of value.

            Industry

            leaders are already eyeing the next major milestone. **Arthur Hayes**,

            co-founder of BitMEX, [predicts\\

            Bitcoin could climb to **$250,000** in 2025](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/how-high-can-bitcoin-go-unchained-forecasts-250k-btc-price-in-2025-and-1m-by-2030/)
            if the Federal

            Reserve pivots to quantitative easing. Meanwhile, technical analysts suggest

            Bitcoin would need to reach approximately **$175,000** to flip

            Apple''s current $3.4 trillion market capitalization.


            ## Institutional Tsunami Driving Unprecedented Demand


            The current

            rally is fundamentally different from previous Bitcoin cycles, driven by **institutional**

            **capital rather than retail speculation**. A remarkable **86% of**

            **institutional investors** now hold or plan to allocate to digital

            assets, with 84% increasing their crypto exposure in 2024.


            **BlackRock''s**

            **iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)** has become the crown jewel of institutional adoption, attracting

            over **$90 billion in assets under management**. The fund''s success

            demonstrates Wall Street''s growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset

            class. Combined with other Bitcoin ETFs, these investment vehicles now hold

            approximately **1.48 million BTC**, worth more than **$170**

            **billion**.


            Source: Bitbo.io


            Corporate

            treasuries are leading another wave of adoption. **MicroStrategy** continues

            its aggressive accumulation strategy, recently adding **21,021 BTC** worth

            approximately **$2.46 billion**. The company now holds nearly **628,800**

            **BTC** valued at over **$76 billion**, transforming from a

            software company into the world''s largest Bitcoin treasury company.


            This

            corporate playbook is spreading rapidly. Over **200 companies** have

            now added cryptocurrencies to their treasuries, with 64 corporations

            specifically holding Ethereum as an operational asset. The trend represents

            a **structural shift** in how businesses manage their balance

            sheets in an era of monetary expansion.


            A big role at this point is also played by digital asset treasuries, or DATs: "DATs have been a top contributor
            to BTC and ETH''s strong price action - monitoring its share volumes and prices is crucial, as this upward reflexivity
            can equally reverse in a way similar to what happened to investment trusts in the 1920s: when demand, perceived
            scarcity, or the leveraged financial engineering that powers them breaks," said Stan Low, Operations and Research
            at Grvt, a peer-to-peer financial platform.


            ## Trump Administration Unlocks $12.5 Trillion Market


            [President\\

            Trump''s **revolutionary executive order** allowing 401(k)\\

            retirement plans](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/crypto-market-cap-nears-41-trillion-amid-us-approval-for-401k-plans/)
            to invest in cryptocurrencies represents a seismic shift for

            the industry. This policy change potentially opens access to the **$12.5**

            **trillion** held in American retirement accounts, creating an enormous

            new source of demand.


            The

            executive order directs the Labor Department to reexamine guidance on

            alternative asset investments in retirement plans, including **private**

            **equity, real estate, and digital assets**. While implementation may take

            months or years, the mere prospect of this capital influx is already driving

            institutional optimism.

            **Theodorou**,

            co-founder of Australian exchange Coinstash, believes this move toward **$150,000**

            **and beyond could arrive faster than many expect**. The psychological impact

            of government endorsement combined with practical access to retirement funds

            creates a powerful feedback loop for Bitcoin adoption.

            regulatory breakthrough follows other Trump administration initiatives,

            including the establishment of a **U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** and

            the **Digital Asset Market Clarity Act**. These policy changes have

            created the most favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in U.S.

            history.


            ## Technical Analysis Points to $200,000 Target


            Bitcoin''s

            technical setup remains **overwhelmingly bullish** despite its

            recent record-breaking performance. The cryptocurrency successfully broke

            through key resistance levels at **$120,000** and **$123,000**,

            establishing new support zones that provide a foundation for further gains.


            Paul Howard, Wincent


            **Paul**

            **Howard from Wincent** notes

            that "there are very few sellers above $120,000. Most long term holding

            wallets were active selling into the rally at the $112,000-$116,000

            level." This suggests **limited selling pressure** at current

            levels, with institutional buyers continuing to absorb available supply.


            The options

            market provides compelling evidence of bullish sentiment. **Howard** highlights

            that "the strongest sell pressure in puts at $115,000 for month end,"

            while the "BTC 15 AUG Expiry calls at $120,000 being the most heavily

            traded options contract". This concentration of call options at key levels

            indicates traders expect continued upward momentum.

            representing an 82% surge from current levels. This prediction aligns with

            multiple institutional forecasts suggesting Bitcoin''s fair value could

            reach **$230,000**.


            For

            investors following the **Stock-to-Flow model**, Howard observes that

            "we are now trading below which would indicate we are likely to enter a

            higher level for BTC in the coming weeks and break through the psychological

            ATH in the coming weeks". The S2F model, which has tracked Bitcoin with unprecedented

            consistency for 16 years, projects gradual adoption-driven growth toward much

            higher levels.


            ## ETF Inflows Reach Record Levels


            Bitcoin ETF

            demand has reached **unprecedented heights** in 2025, with

            cumulative net inflows now exceeding **$14.8 billion**. This represents

            a significant acceleration compared to the same period in 2024, demonstrating

            sustained institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure.


            **BlackRock''s**

            **IBIT** continues

            to dominate the ETF landscape, recently recording **$111 million** in

            net inflows in a single day. The fund''s success has attracted attention from

            major institutions, with **Harvard University''s** IBIT stake now

            exceeding its positions in **Nvidia and Alphabet**.


            Source: Farside Investors


            The ETF

            ecosystem has fundamentally altered Bitcoin''s supply dynamics. **Post-halving**

            **issuance** combined with consistent ETF demand means that institutional

            buyers are absorbing most newly mined Bitcoin. This structural supply squeeze

            creates conditions for sustained price appreciation even with moderate

            additional demand.


            **Monthly**

            **ETF inflows** have

            consistently outpaced Bitcoin''s production rate, with August 2025 seeing

            particularly strong demand. This trend suggests that Bitcoin''s scarcity is

            becoming more pronounced as institutional investors compete for limited supply.


            ## Altcoin Season Signals Broader Market Strength


            While

            Bitcoin reaches new heights, **altcoin markets** are showing signs

            of their own renaissance. The **Altcoin Season Index** has climbed

            to 41, indicating growing momentum in alternative cryptocurrencies[Cryptocurrencies\\

            **Agne**

            **Linge**, Head of

            Growth at WeFi, observes that "the biggest winner these days is ETH, which

            has finally reached near its all-time high. The market sentiment is very

            positive." She notes that while "some long-term holders cashed out as

            soon as Bitcoin reached its ATH," the underlying demand "remains very

            strong, seeing all the interest on the governmental and institutional

            level."


            **Ethereum** has emerged as a major

            **Linge** explains the current cycle

            dynamics: "The strong performance of BTC and ETH is bringing excitement to

            the altcoin season, as is usually the case in the cycle of what comes next:

            BTC, then ETH, and then altcoins." She notes that "altcoin buyers are

            looking for opportunities to participate in the anticipated altcoin

            market."


            ## Bitcoin Price Predictions Point to Historic Gains


            Leading

            cryptocurrency analysts and institutions have converged on remarkably bullish

            price targets for Bitcoin through 2025 and beyond.


            - **Cathie Wood''s** Ark

            Invest maintains their **$1 million** Bitcoin target within five

            years, driven by Bitcoin''s finite supply and growing global adoption as a store

            of value.

            - **Standard**

            **Chartered** has

            set a **$200,000** target for Bitcoin by end-2025, while **Citigroup** forecasts

            Bitcoin could reach **$199,000** under favorable conditions. These

            predictions are supported by quantitative models that suggest Bitcoin''s fair

            value at current sovereign debt levels sits around **$230,000**.

            - **PlanB''s**

            **Stock-to-Flow model** maintains

            its prediction of Bitcoin reaching **$500,000** in 2025, with the

            analyst noting that his "forward guidance for 2025 has not changed since

            2022." The model projects an average price of **$500,000** with

            a range between **$250,000** and **$1 million**.

            - **Digital**

            **Coin Price** presents

            one of the most aggressive forecasts, predicting an average Bitcoin price

            of **$223,028** in 2025. Their analysis projects steady

            acceleration in Bitcoin''s growth, with an impressive average price of **$479,680** by

            2029.

            ## Bitcoin News FAQ


            ## How Much Will 1 Bitcoin Cost in 2025?


            Expert

            consensus points to Bitcoin reaching $145,167 to $200,000 by end-2025. The most

            widely cited institutional forecast comes from Standard Chartered, which

            maintains its $200,000 target for year-end 2025.


            Finder.com''s survey

            of 24 cryptocurrency experts predicts an average price of $145,167 by

            December 2025, up from their previous forecast of $135,048. However,

            predictions vary significantly, with optimistic scenarios reaching as high

            as $250,000 and conservative estimates around $87,618.


            ## How Much Will BTC Be Worth in 2030?


            Bitcoin''s

            2030 price predictions range from $300,000 to over $1 million, with most

            experts converging around the $700,000 to $1 million range.


            ARK

            Invest''s Cathie Wood maintains her bullish outlook with a base case

            of $710,000 and a bull case of $1.5 million by 2030. Her

            previous predictions have consistently targeted Bitcoin reaching $1

            million within five years, driven by institutional adoption and finite

            supply dynamics.


            ## Will Bitcoin Reach $10 Million?


            Yes,

            several prominent figures believe Bitcoin will eventually reach $10 million,

            though timeframes vary significantly.


            Michael

            Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has publicly predicted Bitcoin could reach $10

            million to $13 million per coin by 2045. His conviction stems from Bitcoin''s

            fixed supply and potential to absorb value from traditional asset classes like

            real estate, gold, and stocks.


            Robert

            Kiyosaki, author of "Rich Dad, Poor Dad," has consistently predicted

            Bitcoin could reach $10 million per coin in the near future. His

            optimism is based on Bitcoin''s qualities as an inflation hedge and its limited

            supply.


            ## How Much Will Bitcoin Be in 2050?


            Bitcoin

            price predictions for 2050 range from $1.1 million to over $3.4 million, with

            most experts expecting prices well above $1 million.


            Cryptomus presents

            one of the most aggressive forecasts, predicting Bitcoin could reach $3,454,010 by

            2050\. Their model shows steady acceleration, with average prices around $3.1

            million and potential highs exceeding $3.4 million.


            Bitcoin price

            ( [BTC](https://www.financemagnates.com/tag/bitcoin/)) has exploded to a new all-time high above $124,000, briefly
            overtaking

            Google''s market capitalization to become the world''s fifth-largest asset. With

            institutional adoption accelerating and Federal Reserve rate cuts on the

            horizon, analysts are now targeting $200,000 by year-end 2025.


            The

            cryptocurrency''s meteoric rise reflects a **fundamental shift** in

            how institutions view digital assets: no longer as speculative investments but

            as strategic treasury assets and inflation hedges.

            ## Institutional Tsunami Driving Unprecedented Demand


            The current

            **capital rather than retail speculation**. A remarkable **86% of**

            **institutional investors** now hold or plan to allocate to digital

            assets, with 84% increasing their crypto exposure in 2024.


            **BlackRock''s**

            **iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)** has become the crown jewel of institutional adoption, attracting

            over **$90 billion in assets under management**. The fund''s success

            demonstrates Wall Street''s growing confidence in Bitcoin as a legitimate asset

            class. Combined with other Bitcoin ETFs, these investment vehicles now hold

            approximately **1.48 million BTC**, worth more than **$170**

            **billion**.


            Source: Bitbo.io


            Corporate

            treasuries are leading another wave of adoption. **MicroStrategy** continues

            its aggressive accumulation strategy, recently adding **21,021 BTC** worth

            approximately **$2.46 billion**. The company now holds nearly **628,800**

            **BTC** valued at over **$76 billion**, transforming from a

            software company into the world''s largest Bitcoin treasury company.

            now added cryptocurrencies to their treasuries, with 64 corporations

            a **structural shift** in how businesses manage their balance

            sheets in an era of monetary expansion.


            A big role at this point is also played by digital asset treasuries, or DATs: "DATs have been a top contributor
            to BTC and ETH''s strong price action - monitoring its share volumes and prices is crucial, as this upward reflexivity
            can equally reverse in a way similar to what happened to investment trusts in the 1920s: when demand, perceived

            **Mena**

            **Theodorou**,

            co-founder of Australian exchange Coinstash, believes this move toward **$150,000**

            **and beyond could arrive faster than many expect**. The psychological impact

            of government endorsement combined with practical access to retirement funds

            creates a powerful feedback loop for Bitcoin adoption.


            This

            regulatory breakthrough follows other Trump administration initiatives,

            including the establishment of a **U.S. Strategic Bitcoin Reserve** and

            the **Digital Asset Market Clarity Act**. These policy changes have

            created the most favorable regulatory environment for cryptocurrencies in U.S.

            history.


            ## Technical Analysis Points to $200,000 Target


            Bitcoin''s

            technical setup remains **overwhelmingly bullish** despite its

            recent record-breaking performance. The cryptocurrency successfully broke

            through key resistance levels at **$120,000** and **$123,000**,

            establishing new support zones that provide a foundation for further gains.


            Paul Howard, Wincent


            **Paul**

            **Howard from Wincent** notes

            that "there are very few sellers above $120,000. Most long term holding

            wallets were active selling into the rally at the $112,000-$116,000

            level." This suggests **limited selling pressure** at current

            levels, with institutional buyers continuing to absorb available supply.


            The options

            market provides compelling evidence of bullish sentiment. **Howard** highlights

            that "the strongest sell pressure in puts at $115,000 for month end,"

            while the "BTC 15 AUG Expiry calls at $120,000 being the most heavily

            traded options contract". This concentration of call options at key levels

            indicates traders expect continued upward momentum.

            **[$200,000 by year-end 2025](https://www.financemagnates.com/trending/how-high-can-bitcoin-go-new-btc-price-predictions-point-to-200k-in-2025-and-1m-long-term/)**,

            representing an 82% surge from current levels. This prediction aligns with

            multiple institutional forecasts suggesting Bitcoin''s fair value could

            reach **$230,000**.


            For

            investors following the **Stock-to-Flow model**, Howard observes that

            "we are now trading below which would indicate we are likely to enter a

            higher level for BTC in the coming weeks and break through the psychological

            ATH in the coming weeks". The S2F model, which has tracked Bitcoin with unprecedented

            consistency for 16 years, projects gradual adoption-driven growth toward much

            higher levels.


            ## ETF Inflows Reach Record Levels


            Bitcoin ETF

            demand has reached **unprecedented heights** in 2025, with

            cumulative net inflows now exceeding **$14.8 billion**. This represents

            a significant acceleration compared to the same period in 2024, demonstrating

            sustained institutional appetite for Bitcoin exposure.


            **BlackRock''s**

            **IBIT** continues

            to dominate the ETF landscape, recently recording **$111 million** in

            net inflows in a single day. The fund''s success has attracted attention from

            major institutions, with **Harvard University''s** IBIT stake now

            exceeding its positions in **Nvidia and Alphabet**.


            Source: Farside Investors


            The ETF

            ecosystem has fundamentally altered Bitcoin''s supply dynamics. **Post-halving**

            **issuance** combined with consistent ETF demand means that institutional

            buyers are absorbing most newly mined Bitcoin. This structural supply squeeze

            creates conditions for sustained price appreciation even with moderate

            additional demand.


            **Monthly**

            **ETF inflows** have

            consistently outpaced Bitcoin''s production rate, with August 2025 seeing

            particularly strong demand. This trend suggests that Bitcoin''s scarcity is

            becoming more pronounced as institutional investors compete for limited supply.


            ## Altcoin Season Signals Broader Market Strength


            While

            Bitcoin reaches new heights, **altcoin markets** are showing signs

            of their own renaissance. The **Altcoin Season Index** has climbed

            to 41, indicating growing momentum in alternative cryptocurrencies[Cryptocurrencies\\

            Agne Linge, Head of Growth at WeFi


            **Agne**

            **Linge**, Head of

            Growth at WeFi, observes that "the biggest winner these days is ETH, which

            has finally reached near its all-time high. The market sentiment is very

            positive." She notes that while "some long-term holders cashed out as

            soon as Bitcoin reached its ATH," the underlying demand "remains very

            strong, seeing all the interest on the governmental and institutional

            level."


            **Ethereum** has emerged as a major

            beneficiary of this rotation, [surging nearly **30%** in recent\\

            Spot Ethereum ETFs have

            attracted **$2.3 billion** in net inflows, including a

            record-breaking **$1 billion** in a single day.


            **Linge** explains the current cycle

            dynamics: "The strong performance of BTC and ETH is bringing excitement to

            the altcoin season, as is usually the case in the cycle of what comes next:

            BTC, then ETH, and then altcoins." She notes that "altcoin buyers are

            looking for opportunities to participate in the anticipated altcoin

            market."


            ## Bitcoin Price Predictions Point to Historic Gains


            Leading

            cryptocurrency analysts and institutions have converged on remarkably bullish

            price targets for Bitcoin through 2025 and beyond.


            - **Cathie Wood''s** Ark

            Invest maintains their **$1 million** Bitcoin target within five

            years, driven by Bitcoin''s finite supply and growing global adoption as a store

            of value.

            - **Standard**

            **Chartered** has

            set a **$200,000** target for Bitcoin by end-2025, while **Citigroup** forecasts

            Bitcoin could reach **$199,000** under favorable conditions. These

            predictions are supported by quantitative models that suggest Bitcoin''s fair

            value at current sovereign debt levels sits around **$230,000**.

            - **PlanB''s**

            **Stock-to-Flow model** maintains

            its prediction of Bitcoin reaching **$500,000** in 2025, with the

            analyst noting that his "forward guidance for 2025 has not changed since

            2022." The model projects an average price of **$500,000** with

            a range between **$250,000** and **$1 million**.

            - **Digital**

            **Coin Price** presents

            one of the most aggressive forecasts, predicting an average Bitcoin price

            of **$223,028** in 2025. Their analysis projects steady

            acceleration in Bitcoin''s growth, with an impressive average price of **$479,680** by

            2029.

            ## Bitcoin News FAQ


            ## How Much Will 1 Bitcoin Cost in 2025?


            Expert

            consensus points to Bitcoin reaching $145,167 to $200,000 by end-2025. The most

            widely cited institutional forecast comes from Standard Chartered, which

            maintains its $200,000 target for year-end 2025.


            Finder.com''s survey

            of 24 cryptocurrency experts predicts an average price of $145,167 by

            December 2025, up from their previous forecast of $135,048. However,

            predictions vary significantly, with optimistic scenarios reaching as high

            as $250,000 and conservative estimates around $87,618.


            ## How Much Will BTC Be Worth in 2030?


            Bitcoin''s

            2030 price predictions range from $300,000 to over $1 million, with most

            experts converging around the $700,000 to $1 million range.


            ARK

            Invest''s Cathie Wood maintains her bullish outlook with a base case

            of $710,000 and a bull case of $1.5 million by 2030. Her

            previous predictions have consistently targeted Bitcoin reaching $1

            million within five years, driven by institutional adoption and finite

            supply dynamics.


            ## Will Bitcoin Reach $10 Million?


            Yes,

            several prominent figures believe Bitcoin will eventually reach $10 million,

            though timeframes vary significantly.


            Michael

            Saylor, CEO of MicroStrategy, has publicly predicted Bitcoin could reach $10

            million to $13 million per coin by 2045. His conviction stems from Bitcoin''s

            fixed supply and potential to absorb value from traditional asset classes like

            real estate, gold, and stocks.


            Robert

            Kiyosaki, author of "Rich Dad, Poor Dad," has consistently predicted

            Bitcoin could reach $10 million per coin in the near future. His

            optimism is based on Bitcoin''s qualities as an inflation hedge and its limited

            supply.


            ## How Much Will Bitcoin Be in 2050?


            Bitcoin

            price predictions for 2050 range from $1.1 million to over $3.4 million, with

            most experts expecting prices well above $1 million.


            Cryptomus presents

            one of the most aggressive forecasts, predicting Bitcoin could reach $3,454,010 by

            2050\. Their model shows steady acceleration, with average prices around $3.1

            million and potential highs exceeding $3.4 million.

            \n**_Ethereum has seen over $1 billion in ETF inflows in a single day, lifting the price toward the $4,800 mark,\
            \ while Standard Chartered now expects ETH to reach $7,500 by year-end._**\n\nEthereum nears its November 2021\
            \ all-time high of $4,891 as spot ETFs deliver massive inflows and institutional appetite accelerates. Can this\
            \ wave of demand and capital push ETH past that threshold and sustain further gains before year’s end?\n\n## **Current\
            \ Momentum & Short-Term Outlook**\n\n[![Ethereum 1 (1)](https://investinghaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Ethereum-1-1-1.png.webp)](https://investinghaven.com/crypto-blockchain/ethereum-price-prediction-will-eth-smash-its-4800-all-time-high-this-year/attachment/ethereum-1-1-6/)\n\
            \nEthereum’s price climbed above $4,700 on 13th August 2025, sustained by a [record-setting $1 billion in daily\
            \ ETF inflows](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/12/u-s-spot-ether-etfs-hit-usd1b-daily-inflow-for-first-time)\
            \ led by BlackRock ($640 million), Fidelity ($270 million), and Grayscale ($80 million).\n\nAt the same time,\
            \ large-scale players such as BitMine and SharpLink Gaming have ramped up their ETH holdings, strengthening demand\
            \ . Technical analysis shows ETH broke multi-year resistance near $4,000 and now tests the $4,800 ceiling. If\
            \ buyers hold these levels, the asset could rally toward $5,000 or more in the near term.\n\n**RECOMMENDED:**\

            \nStandard Chartered [raised its 2025 year-end forecast to $7,500](https://www.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/standard-chartered-raises-ethereum-price-target-to-7500-for-2025-93CH-4188585),\
            \ citing regulatory progress, ETF approval momentum, and surging demand for applications tied to stablecoins and\
            \ Layer 1 usage.\n\nInvesting Haven’s [Ethereum price predictions](https://investinghaven.com/ethereum-eth-price-predictions/)\
            \ see ETH reaching $5,000 or more by the end of 2025 amid improving macro signals and institutional adoption.\n\
            \nAlternative projections include Finder expecting over $6,100 in 2025, Changelly suggesting potential highs of\
            \ $6,500 or more, and DigitalCoinPrice forecasting peaks near $6,900.\n\nThese forecasts hinge on continued capital\
            \ flows, demand from DeFi and staking, and favorable regulation.\n\n**RECOMMENDED:** [How to Buy Ethereum (ETH)\

            \n## **Bullish Scenarios & Risks**\n\nIf Ethereum ETF inflows remain strong and institutional activity continues\
            \ to ramp, ETH may breach $4,800 and extend to $5,000–$6,000. Momentum could even support a run toward Standard\
            \ Chartered’s $7,500 forecast.\n\nHowever, elevated technical indicators risk short-term pullbacks, and any macroeconomic\
            \ shocks or regulatory uncertainties could halt the rally.\n\n## **Conclusion**\n\nEthereum stands within reach\
            \ of its all-time high. With ETF inflows and institutional demand powering it, ETH may clear $4,800 and target\
            \ new highs—but it must navigate volatility and macro risks first.\n\n[![Buy Ethereum Now button](https://investinghaven.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/button_buy-ethereum-eth-now-1.png.webp)](https://gtly.ink/Xk-xXE5Svd)\

            [ETH-USD \\

            -4.04%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/ "ETH-USD")


            ## Key Points


            - Ethereum is the top blockchain for stablecoins and tokenized real-world assets, both of which are growing rapidly.


            - Ethereum ETFs had record inflows in July.


            - It''s a high-risk, high-reward asset, so take a cautious approach if you invest.


            - [10 stocks we like better than Ethereum ›](https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&impression=3b7218ee-c334-4ad2-b616-fe09ac147415&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-nonbbn-kp%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaedikp0000053%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Dkeypoints_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D17670)



            A few months ago, **Ethereum**(CRYPTO: ETH) was in rough shape. It had fallen below $1,600, its lowest price since
            2023, and investors were wondering when it would stop the bleeding. But the second-largest cryptocurrency has
            made an impressive turnaround, growing by 57% in July and recently surpassing $4,300 (as of Aug. 10).


            The question now is whether Ethereum has become overvalued or if it''s still a good long-term investment. While
            cryptocurrencies are notoriously unpredictable, Ethereum''s strengths line up well with where the market is going,
            and that could result in substantial growth over the next five years.


            ## Ethereum could be crucial for crypto''s mainstream adoption


            There have been some major cryptocurrency developments so far this year. In July, the U.S. passed the Genius Act,
            the first significant piece of crypto legislation. It regulates stablecoins, which are crypto tokens designed
            to maintain the same value as another asset such as the U.S. dollar. [Stablecoins have been growing rapidly](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/07/26/stablecoins-are-on-the-rise-x-reasons-investors-sh/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=51539a02-4b4d-44c1-a3bb-770ddce1803d),
            now with a total combined market value of about $270 billion. Some analysts, as well as Treasury Secretary Scott
            Bessent, predict that it could rise to $2 trillion by 2028.


            We''ve also seen substantial growth in the tokenization of real-world assets (RWA). This refers to turning financial
            assets, such as stocks and bonds, into tokens on the blockchain. The total RWA value across all blockchains has
            increased by 63% to $26 billion on the year.


            Stablecoins and RWA are potential avenues for increased crypto adoption, as they''re areas where [blockchain technology](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/financials/blockchain-stocks/blockchain-applications/?utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=51539a02-4b4d-44c1-a3bb-770ddce1803d)
            could merge with traditional financial systems. Crucially, Ethereum is a leader in both areas. Of the $270 billion
            in stablecoins in circulation, 51% are on the Ethereum blockchain. It''s also the blockchain that **JPMorgan Chase**
            and **PayPal** have chosen for their own stablecoin projects.


            Image source: Getty Images.


            Ethereum also has $7.1 billion in RWA, the most of any blockchain (second place has $2.4 billion). The RWA tokenization
            sector is still very new and unproven, but it could be the next area of explosive growth for cryptocurrency. If
            so, Ethereum will likely be one of the coins that benefits the most.


            ## Following in Bitcoin''s footsteps


            **Bitcoin** is up 177% since the start of 2024, in large part because of growing popularity with institutional
            investors and businesses. Bitcoin ETFs received SEC approval in January 2024 and have had cumulative inflows of
            nearly $55 billion. There has also been a rise in Bitcoin treasury companies that make investing in Bitcoin a
            business strategy, with **Strategy** leading the way. Strategy first purchased Bitcoin five years ago, and its
            share price has grown over 3,000% since then.


            Story Continues


            Ethereum is now starting to benefit from the same tailwinds. Ethereum ETFs had their best month yet in July, with
            record inflows of $5.4 billion (close to the $6 billion taken in by Bitcoin ETFs). There are now also Ethereum
            treasury companies, most notably **Bitmine**, which has set a goal of owning 5% of the total Ethereum supply.
            Since launching its Ethereum treasury strategy on June 30, Bitmine''s stock is up 52%.


            While Bitcoin is still the much more popular investment, Ethereum has a key advantage that could help it close
            the gap. Companies that buy Ethereum can stake their holdings and earn more ETH tokens as a reward, generally
            at a rate of about 3% or more per year. There''s the opportunity to generate a return on Ethereum, which isn''t
            possible with Bitcoin. Multiple fund managers have also filed to add staking to their Ethereum ETFs. If approved,
            that feature could bring in even more institutional capital.


            ## Ethereum could triple in value by 2030


            No crypto investment is perfect. Ethereum faces heavy competition from other blockchains, some of which offer
            faster, cheaper transactions. Ethereum is improving in this regard, as it has made several recent upgrades to
            its network, but it''s still not the most efficient blockchain.


            Despite that, I like how integral Ethereum is to stablecoins and RWA, and I think the increased institutional
            interest will help it keep growing. Over the last five years, Ethereum has grown over 1,000% from about $380 to
            $4,300. It probably won''t replicate those gains, but based on its current growth, I could see it increasing by
            180% and hitting $12,000 during the next five years.


            Considering Ethereum''s volatility, you shouldn''t bet your whole financial future on it. But Ethereum is a crypto
            investment worth considering as one small part of a balanced portfolio.


            ## Should you buy stock in Ethereum right now?


            Before you buy stock in Ethereum, consider this:


            The _Motley Fool Stock Advisor_ analyst team just identified what they believe are the **[10 best stocks](https://api.fool.com/infotron/infotrack/click?apikey=35527423-a535-4519-a07f-20014582e03e&impression=1352aba0-6b5b-4e29-b131-fb05747b4d59&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.fool.com%2Fmms%2Fmark%2Fe-sa-bbn-bn%3Faid%3D8867%26source%3Disaeditxt0001138%26ftm_cam%3Dsa-bbn-evergreen%26ftm_veh%3Darticle_pitch_feed_yahoo%26ftm_pit%3D18006&utm_source=yahoo-host-full&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=51539a02-4b4d-44c1-a3bb-770ddce1803d)**
            for investors to buy now… and Ethereum wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster
            returns in the coming years.


            Consider when **Netflix** made this list on December 17, 2004... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, **you’d
            have $660,783**!\\* Or when **Nvidia** made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time
            of our recommendation, **you’d have $1,122,682**!\*


            Now, it’s worth noting _Stock Advisor’s_ total average return is 1,069% — a market-crushing outperformance compared
            to 184% for the S&P 500. Don’t miss out on the latest top 10 list, available when you join _Stock Advisor_.

    response: '**Crypto Market Trends & Major Developments**


      **Bitcoin (BTC):**


      *   **Record Highs:** Bitcoin has recently hit record highs, trading near **$123,500** after reaching **$124,128**.
      This surge is largely attributed to the increasing odds of an easier monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
      "The top crypto is up 3.6% in the past 24 hours and is trading near $123,500, following a record high of $124,128 earlier
      in the trading session, according to CoinGecko data." "Bitcoin hit record highs on Wednesday with the increasing odds
      of an easier monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve." Additionally, Bitcoin has gained **31% year-to-date** and
      is up **60% from April''s market lows**. "The cryptocurrency has gained 31% year to date and is up 60% from April’s
      market lows."

      *   **Institutional Demand & Regulatory Environment:** Inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and purchases
      by public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets have been key drivers. "Inflows into spot exchange-traded
      funds, along with purchases from public companies copying the blueprint of software firm-turned-bitcoin juggernaut Strategy
      (MSTR) by adding bitcoin to their balance sheets, have been key drivers of this year’s token rally." The Trump administration''s
      pro-crypto stance is also a significant catalyst. "Strategists also point to the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance
      as a major catalyst."

      *   **Potential for Further Upside:** Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan suggests four untapped developments could trigger further
      price growth: government demand for crypto as reserve assets, a weak US Dollar, low volatility, and the potential rebirth
      of a regulated ICO market. "The crypto market could witness a strong uptrend in the coming months from four key price
      catalysts, including government demand, a weak US Dollar, low volatility, and potential rebirth of the ICO market, according
      to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan in a report on Wednesday."

      *   **Government Bitcoin Purchases:** While a previous statement indicated the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would rely
      on forfeited BTC, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later tweeted, suggesting direct government Bitcoin purchases remain
      a possibility. "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who stated in an interview with FOX Business on Thursday that the
      government won''t be purchasing Bitcoin directly. He said the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will rely on BTC forfeited
      to the federal government." However, "The Treasury Secretary''s late-Thursday afternoon tweet seemingly contradicted
      his statement from earlier in the day."

      *   **Declining Volatility:** The decline in Bitcoin''s volatility since the launch of spot BTC ETFs in January 2024
      has increased its chances of allocation in institutional portfolios. "The Bitwise CIO also expressed that the decline
      in Bitcoin''s volatility, especially since the launch of spot BTC ETFs in January 2024, has increased the chances of
      its allocation in institutional portfolios."


      **Ethereum (ETH):**


      *   **Near Record Levels & Strong Inflows:** Ethereum prices have risen to near record levels, with its native token,
      ether, jumping as much as **6% to hover above $4,700**, just shy of its 2021 record highs. "Meanwhile, ethereum (ETH-USD)
      prices rose to near record levels on Wednesday as Wall Street grows increasingly bullish on the world''s second-largest
      cryptocurrency by market cap." "Ethereum''s native token, ether, jumped as much as 6% to hover above $4,700 per token,
      just shy of its 2021 record highs." Institutional investors are flooding into Ethereum funds at nearly triple the rate
      of Bitcoin, with **$704 million in inflows** on Wednesday compared to Bitcoin ETFs'' $86.7 million. "Institutional investors
      are flooding into Ethereum funds at nearly triple the rate of Bitcoin, providing a glimpse at how Wall Street may be
      positioning this year for the second-largest crypto." "Ethereum exchange-traded funds clocked $704 million in inflows
      on Wednesday compared to Bitcoin ETFs'' $86.7 million, the third consecutive day of Ethereum’s dominance over the alpha
      coin, according to Farside Investors data."

      *   **Regulatory Clarity & Institutional Adoption:** Ethereum is benefiting from regulatory developments, including
      the GENIUS Act and SEC Chair Paul Atkins'' "Project Crypto" speech supporting DeFi growth for institutions. "Institutional
      investors are flooding into Ethereum funds at nearly triple the rate of Bitcoin, providing a glimpse at how Wall Street
      may be positioning this year for the second-largest crypto." "The momentum has propelled Ethereum to $4,775, up over
      60% in the past month, according to CoinGecko, and within 4% of its November 2021 all-time high near $4,900." "Ether,
      the native token of ethereum, is up more than 50% since the GENIUS Act legislation, which creates guardrails for the
      stablecoin industry, was passed last month." "Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission''s recent "Project
      Crypto" announcement, an initiative to modernize the agency and establish clear regulations around the digital asset
      industry, has also fueled the rally in ethereum."

      *   **Price Targets and Supply-Demand Imbalance:** Standard Chartered revised its Ethereum price targets to **$7,500
      by 2025 and $25,000 by 2028**, citing institutional buying at "nearly double the pace of Bitcoin accumulation during
      peak periods." "On Wednesday, Standard Chartered revised its Ethereum price targets to $7,500 by 2025 and $25,000 by
      2028, up from a previous $4,000 forecast, citing institutional buying at \"nearly double the pace of Bitcoin accumulation
      during peak periods.\" Monthly Ethereum ETF inflows have reached **$2.3 billion**, equivalent to 500,000 ETH, while
      the network has issued only 450,000 ETH since the September 2022 merge upgrade, creating an upward price pressure. "Monthly
      Ethereum ETF inflows have reached $2.3 billion, equivalent to 500,000 ETH, while the network has issued only 450,000
      ETH since the September 2022 merge upgrade." "The supply-demand imbalance has created upward price pressure as institutional
      buyers absorb available supply faster than the network creates new tokens."

      *   **Corporate Balance Sheet Additions:** Companies are adding ether to their balance sheets to gain exposure to the
      tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets. "Companies have been adding ether to their balance
      sheets as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets, such as
      stablecoins." Bitmine Immersion Technologies, an Ethereum treasury company, plans to sell up to another **$20 billion
      worth of stock** to boost its ETH holdings. "This week, Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), an ethereum treasury
      company, announced plans to sell up to another $20 billion worth of stock to boost its holdings of the cryptocurrency."


      **XRP:**


      *   **Regulatory Clarity & Price Ascent:** Increased "regulatory clarity from the SEC v. Ripple case resolution" is
      cited as one of the reasons for XRP''s recent ascent. "Increased “regulatory clarity from the SEC v. Ripple case resolution,”
      Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget research, told Decrypt, is one of the reasons for XRP’s recent ascent."

      *   **Price Targets & Long-Term Adoption:** The upper limit of the target for 2025 is **$5.81**, with expectations for
      widespread adoption in the long run to push XRP''s price to nearly **$9 by the end of 2026**. "The upper limit of his
      target for 2025 is $5.81, but he expects widespread adoption in the long run to push the XRP’s price to nearly $9 by
      the end of 2026."

      *   **Real World Asset Tokenization:** Ripple Senior Vice President Markus Infanger explains that the XRP Ledger is
      "uniquely suited" for real-world asset tokenization. "Ripple Exec on Why XRP Ledger Is ‘Uniquely Suited’ for Real World
      Asset Tokenization" https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/08/14/ripple-exec-on-why-xrp-ledger-is-uniquely-suited-for-real-world-asset-tokenization
      (2025-08-14T11:14:00Z)


      **General Crypto Market Trends:**


      *   **"Exceptionally Strong" Conditions:** The overall crypto market conditions are described as "exceptionally strong."
      "So far, conditions look exceptionally strong,” Lawant added."

      *   **Influence of Federal Reserve Policy:** The increasing odds of an easier monetary policy from the U.S. Federal
      Reserve, specifically the potential for September rate cuts soaring above 90%, are encouraging borrowing and stimulating
      spending, which tends to benefit the crypto market. "With the odds of a September rate cut soaring above 90%, a lower
      interest rate would encourage borrowing and stimulate spending. The stock market and crypto tend to rise in such environments,
      as investors seek higher yields from risk assets."

      *   **Risk-On Environment:** Bitcoin is joining global stocks in scaling record peaks, indicating a "risk-on" market
      sentiment. "You know markets are fully risk-on when cryptocurrencies are on a tear, with bitcoin joining global stocks
      to scale a record peak as the near certainty of U.S. interest rate cuts bolsters risk sentiment and weighs on the dollar."

      *   **Caution Regarding Rate Cut Assumptions:** Some analysts caution that the market might be "priced for perfection"
      regarding the assumption of Fed rate cuts, especially with core CPI ticking up slightly and unknown impacts of tariffs.
      "Still, the \"clear danger\" is the market''s assumption that the Fed will cut rates next month, Hundal cautioned."

      *   **Regulatory Climate:** A crypto-friendly regulatory climate in Washington under the Trump administration is contributing
      to renewed buying pressure and confidence. "Renewed buying pressure and confidence can also be attributed to the crypto-friendly
      regulatory climate in Washington under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration."

      *   **Leverage Flush:** A recent **$1 billion leverage flush** in the crypto market is seen by analysts as a "healthy
      pullback" despite a slide in crypto prices after a troubling U.S. PPI report. "Crypto Slide Spurs $1B Leverage Flush,
      But It''s a Healthy Pullback, Analysts Say" https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/14/crypto-slide-spurs-usd1b-leverage-flush-but-it-s-a-healthy-pullback-analysts-say
      (2025-08-14T12:06:00Z) "Crypto Prices Quickly Slide After Troubling U.S. PPI Report" https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/14/crypto-prices-quickly-slide-after-troubling-u-s-ppi-report
      (2025-08-14T11:00:00Z)

      *   **Potential for "ICO Market 2.0":** SEC Chair Paul Atkins'' "Project Crypto" roadmap could lead to a regulated "ICO
      Market 2.0" era, attracting significant capital. "Lastly, the report highlights how SEC Chair Paul Atkins'' "Project
      Crypto" roadmap could create a potential regulated "ICO Market 2.0" era that could attract huge capital into the market."

      *   **Stablecoin Developments:** Wall Street and consumer advocates are calling for edits to the GENIUS Act on stablecoins,
      even before regulators begin writing rules. "Wall Street Joins Consumer Advocates to Call for Edit to GENIUS Act on
      Stablecoins" https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/14/wall-street-joins-consumer-advocates-to-call-for-edit-to-genius-act-on-stablecoins
      (2025-08-14T16:34:00Z)

      *   **US Blacklisting:** The U.S. has blacklisted a crypto network behind a Ruble-backed stablecoin and a shuttered
      exchange, accusing them of money laundering and sanctions evasion. "U.S. Blacklists Crypto Network Behind Ruble-Backed
      Stablecoin and Shuttered Exchange Garantex" https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/14/ofac-sanctions-crypto-network-behind-ruble-backed-stablecoin-and-shuttered-exchange-garantex

            # Crypto Market Conditions ‘Exceptionally Strong’ as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP Advance


            [Akash Girimath](https://finance.yahoo.com/author/)


            Wed, August 13, 2025 at 11:57 PM EDT2 min read


            ## In this article:


            [BTC-USD \\

            +1.83%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/ "BTC-USD")


            [ETH-USD \\

            +2.43%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/ "ETH-USD")


            [XRP-USD \\

            +0.71%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XRP-USD/ "XRP-USD")


            Bitcoin hit record highs on Wednesday with the increasing odds of an easier monetary policy from the U.S. Federal
            Reserve.


            The top crypto is up 3.6% in the past 24 hours and is trading near $123,500, following a record high of $124,128
            earlier in the trading session, according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/bitcoin) data.


            “Liquidity is being shovelled into risk assets right now, and there is no obvious sign of any overheating, Pav
            Hundal, lead market analyst at Swyftx, told _Decrypt_. “Funding rates are well within normal ranges across all
            the major global exchanges.”


            With the odds of a September rate cut soaring above 90%, a lower interest rate would encourage borrowing and stimulate
            spending. The stock market and crypto tend to rise in such environments, as investors seek higher yields from
            risk assets.


            “When Bitcoin enters price discovery, I focus on orderbook dynamics, David Lawant, head of research at crypto
            prime brokerage FalconX, told _Decrypt_.


            “So far, conditions look exceptionally strong,” Lawant added. Bitcoin has held near all-time highs for weeks despite
            heavy selling pressure in the order books. Setups like this can fuel explosive rallies once that selling pressure
            recedes.”

            Renewed buying pressure and confidence can also be attributed to the crypto-friendly regulatory climate in Washington
            under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration.


            “Digital Asset Treasuries” are the primary reason for Ethereum’s recent ascent, Sean Dawson, Derive’s head of
            research, told _Decrypt_ on Monday. He explained that DATs have the “ability to pass on staking rewards, something
            ETFs are currently unable to do.”


            It follows a development by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in May, which [exempted](https://decrypt.co/322934/sec-says-crypto-staking-not-subject-to-securities-laws)
            self-custodial staking from securities laws.

            With the added regulatory clarity and increased investor confidence, Dawson expects Ethereum to surge past his
            year-end target of $6,000 and hit $8,000 to $10,000. He gives these targets a 20% to 10% odds.


            Increased “regulatory clarity from the SEC v. Ripple case resolution,” Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget research,
            told _Decrypt,_ is one of the reasons for XRP’s recent ascent.


            The upper limit of his target for 2025 is $5.81, but he expects widespread adoption in the long run to push the
            XRP’s price to nearly $9 by the end of 2026.


            Still, the "clear danger" is the market''s assumption that the Fed will cut rates next month, Hundal cautioned.


            "Despite the fact that core CPI ticked up slightly, we don’t know what the full impact of tariffs is going to
            be," he said. "It feels like we’re priced for perfection, and that makes me nervous."

            # Ethereum ETF Inflows Outperform Bitcoin for the Third Day Straight














            [Vismaya V](https://finance.yahoo.com/author/)




            Thu, August 14, 2025 at 1:03 AM EDT2 min read






































            ## In this article:














            [ETH-USD \\

            +2.43%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/ "ETH-USD")
















            [BTC-USD \\

            +1.83%](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD/ "BTC-USD")






























            Institutional investors are flooding into Ethereum funds at nearly triple the rate of Bitcoin, providing a glimpse
            at how Wall Street may be positioning this year for the second-largest crypto.




            Ethereum exchange-traded [funds](https://decrypt.co/230228/ethereum-etfs-approved-us) clocked $704 million in
            inflows on Wednesday compared to Bitcoin ETFs'' $86.7 million, the third consecutive day of [Ethereum’s](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-ethereum-quickly-explained-four-minute-guide)
            dominance over the alpha coin, according to Farside Investors data.




            The three-day lead has delivered $2.2 billion to ETH ETFs following Monday''s record $1 billion single-day inflow,
            versus just $330.9 million for [Bitcoin](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-bitcoin-four-minute-instant-guide-explainer)
            products.




            "Institutions are playing a key role," Peter Chung, head of research at Presto Labs, told _Decrypt_ as Ethereum
            benefits from regulatory developments, including the GENIUS Act and the “Project Crypto” speech, where SEC Chair
            Paul Atkins supported DeFi growth for institutions.




            The momentum has propelled Ethereum to $4,775, up over 60% in the past month, according to [CoinGecko](https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/ethereum),
            and within 4% of its November 2021 all-time high near $4,900.




            The rally has already inflicted some pain on bearish traders, with Ethereum liquidations hitting $127.41 million
            in 24 hours as short positions faced pressure from rising prices, according to [CoinGlass](https://www.coinglass.com/LiquidationData).

            Monthly Ethereum ETF inflows have reached $2.3 billion, equivalent to 500,000 ETH, while the network has issued
            only 450,000 ETH [since the September 2022 merge upgrade](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-etf-flows-august-blow-193554787.html).




            The supply-demand imbalance has created upward price pressure as institutional buyers absorb available supply
            faster than the network creates new tokens.




            On Wednesday, Standard Chartered revised its Ethereum price targets to [$7,500 by 2025 and $25,000 by 2028](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-could-soar-25-000-134143910.html),
            up from a [previous $4,000 forecast](https://decrypt.co/310147/ethereum-price-structural-decline-standard-chartered),
            citing institutional buying at "nearly double the pace of Bitcoin accumulation during peak periods."

            Traders on Myriad Markets see an [86.9% probability](https://linea.myriadprotocol.com/markets/ethereum-to-hit-5k-in-2025)
            that Ethereum reaches $5,000 by January 1, 2026.




            _(Disclosure: Myriad Markets is a prediction platform developed by Dastan, parent company of Decrypt.)_




            Digital asset treasury companies, meanwhile, continue to hoover up crypto in record fashion.




            That includes Tom Lee''s BitMine, which just this week announced it would increase its fundraising target for
            buying more of the asset by [$20 billion](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tom-lees-ethereum-treasury-bitmine-174118221.html).




            “When you combine record ETF inflows with corporate and sovereign balance sheet allocations, the result is deep
            structural demand meeting finite supply,” Rachael Lucas, crypto analyst, BTC Markets, told _Decrypt._




            “That''s a recipe for sustained upward pressure on prices, and a sign that digital assets are firmly embedded

            A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Ankur Banerjee




            You know markets are fully risk-on when cryptocurrencies are on a tear, with bitcoin joining global stocks to
            scale a record peak as the near certainty of U.S. interest rate cuts bolsters risk sentiment and weighs on the
            dollar.




            The world''s best-known cryptocurrency, bitcoin, has a lot going for it: prospects of lower interest rates, a
            more favourable regulatory environment, and bullish inflows from institutional investors.




            Ether too has been on the charge, hovering near its highest since November 2021, becoming the token of choice
            for those looking for more active returns. In fact, ether is up 42% this year, outstripping the 32% gain for bitcoin.




            Stocks in Asia were taking a bit of a breather after a blistering rally this week. Japanese shares fell after
            hitting a record high, while tech-heavy Taiwan and South Korean shares eased after recent highs.




            Investors are wagering that the Federal Reserve will resume cutting interest rates from next month, with traders
            starting to even price in odds of a 50 basis points cut after comments from Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent.




            "If we''d seen those numbers in May, in June, I suspect we could have had rate cuts in June and July. So that
            tells me that there''s a very good chance of a 50 basis-point rate cut," in September, Bessent said in an interview
            on Bloomberg Television.




            Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who has been regularly lambasted by U.S. President Donald Trump, is expected to speak
            at a central bank research conference in Wyoming next week and the focus will be on his tone on policy path.




            Bessent also said the Bank of Japan will likely be raising interest rates as it is behind the curve in dealing
            with the risk of inflation, leading to strong gains in the yen, which stayed around its strongest level in three
            weeks.




            Investor focus during European hours will be on a swathe of economic data that will offer a glimpse of the tariff
            uncertainties and the impact of the duties on the economy.

            The baby boomer generation, born from 1946 to 1964, has [reached retirement age](https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/planning/most-realistic-retirement-age-every-state-2/?hyperlink_type=manual&utm_term=incontent_link_1&utm_campaign=1312535&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=1&utm_medium=rss)
            in mass. Unlike the silent generation before them and the subsequent Generation X, many boomers are in a good
            financial position to retire comfortably if they made smart [money moves](https://www.gobankingrates.com/money/financial-planning/money-management/?hyperlink_type=manual&utm_term=incontent_link_2&utm_campaign=1312535&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=2&utm_medium=rss)
            during their careers.




            **Trending Now: [I Asked ChatGPT When I’ll Be Able To Retire Based on My Current Finances — Here’s What It Said](https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/planning/i-asked-chatgpt-when-able-retire-based-on-current-finances/?hyperlink_type=manual&utm_term=related_link_1&utm_campaign=1312535&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=3&utm_medium=rss)**

            You can factor in all the Social Security benefits and retirement income you want, but when it comes to [retirement
            planning](https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/planning/planning-for-retirement/?hyperlink_type=manual&utm_term=incontent_link_3&utm_campaign=1312535&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=5&utm_medium=rss),
            there are a few key things every boomer retiree should always purchase. Why are these items essential for boomers?




            Dennis Shirshikov, a professor at the City University of New York specializing in finance, economics and accounting,
            explained it like this: “Each of these items addresses fundamental aspects of aging, from financial security and
            health to maintaining social ties and independence. Retirement should be about preserving quality of life, and
            these purchases support that goal in various ways.”




            Here are 10 things [boomers should always buy in retirement](https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/planning/im-baby-boomer-why-im-still-not-retired-yet/?hyperlink_type=manual&utm_term=incontent_link_4&utm_campaign=1312535&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=6&utm_medium=rss).




            ## Comprehensive Health Insurance




            Boomers are coming to terms with focusing more on health and healthcare costs. Make sure you have health insurance
            to cover those costs, as basic Medicare might not be enough.




            Michael Collins, CFA, founder and CEO of WinCap Financial, noted, “Boomers should always invest in good quality
            healthcare insurance to ensure they have access to quality healthcare when needed and to avoid large medical bills.”




            “As health needs increase with age, having robust health insurance becomes indispensable,” Shirshikov said. “This
            goes beyond basic Medicare; supplemental plans that cover additional expenses such as prescriptions, dental, and
            vision care can significantly decrease potential out-of-pocket health costs.”




            **Be Aware: [6 Key Signs You’ll Run Out of Retirement Funds Too Early](https://www.gobankingrates.com/retirement/planning/key-signs-youll-run-out-of-retirement-funds-too-early/?hyperlink_type=manual&utm_term=related_link_3&utm_campaign=1312535&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=7&utm_medium=rss)**




            ## Long-Term Care Insurance




            According to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 70% of people over the age of 65 will need some
            form of long-term care in their lifetime, Collins relayed.




            “Boomers should always invest in long-term care insurance to cover the costs of assisted living, nursing homes,
            and in-home care,” added Collins.




            “Given the high cost of long-term care, whether in-home or in a facility, this type of insurance can protect retirees’
            savings and provide more choices for care settings. It’s a prudent buy, considering the peace of mind it brings,”
            explained Shirshikov.






            Story Continues






            ## Annuities




            To mitigate the risk of outliving their savings, boomers — and all other age groups quite frankly — should consider
            [purchasing annuities](https://www.gobankingrates.com/investing/annuities/what-annuity/?hyperlink_type=manual&utm_term=incontent_link_5&utm_campaign=1312535&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=8&utm_medium=rss),
            according to Shirshikov.




            “These financial products can provide a steady income stream for life, aligning well with the need for financial
            stability in retirement,” Shirshikov explained.




            ## Updated Technology




            “Investing in current technology — like smartphones, tablets or emergency alert systems — can enhance daily life,
            maintain social connections and ensure quick access to emergency services,” said Shirshikov.




            “As the world becomes more reliant on technology, boomers should always invest in the necessary devices and internet
            access to stay connected with loved ones, manage finances and access important information,” added Collins.




            ## Home Modifications




            “As mobility becomes limited, investing in home modifications can significantly improve quality of life and independence,”
            Shirshikov pointed out. “Items like stairlifts, walk-in tubs and ramps are not just conveniences; they are essential
            for safe aging in place.”




            “Boomers should always prioritize making these modifications to ensure they can age in place comfortably and safely,”
            Collins suggested.




            ## Vehicle Adaptations




            “For those who continue to drive, vehicle adaptations such as pedal extenders, seat cushioning or hand controls
            can be essential for maintaining independence and safety on the road,” Shirshikov mentioned.




            Beyond just modifying a current car in their possession, boomers should maybe look into purchasing a vehicle they
            know can always be on hand and ready to use — if not by them, then by a family member, friend or neighbor they
            trust.




            “Boomers should always make sure they have a reliable mode of transportation,” Collins recommended. “This could
            mean purchasing a new car with modern safety features or investing in regular maintenance for an older vehicle.”




            ## Legal and Financial Advisory Services




            “Regular consultations with financial advisors and legal experts can help Boomers navigate the complexities of
            estate planning, tax strategies and retirement savings management,” Shirshikov said.




            Collins suggested that estate planning be a top priority for boomers to purchase, just in case the worst-case
            scenario happens.




            “It’s important for boomers to have a proper estate plan in place to protect their assets and ensure their wishes
            are carried out after they pass away,” Collins said. “This may include creating a will, setting up trusts and
            designating beneficiaries for retirement accounts.”




            ## Travel




            Retirement is when you have all the time in the world for relaxation, rest and pleasure — particularly for a generation
            prioritizing work and careers. Use some of your hard-earned income to go somewhere you have never been or a place
            you always love to visit.




            “Boomers should always [budget for travel](https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/travel/ways-to-travel-in-retirement-without-blowing-your-savings/?hyperlink_type=manual&utm_term=incontent_link_6&utm_campaign=1312535&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=9&utm_medium=rss)
            and leisure activities to stay physically and mentally active, and to create lasting memories with loved ones,”
            Collins said.




            “Often overlooked as a ‘luxury,’ travel can be an essential aspect of retirement, offering relaxation and cognitive
            and social stimulation,” said Shirshikov. “Planning trips and exploring new places can be incredibly enriching.”




            ## Community Classes or Club Memberships




            “Participating in community events, taking classes, or maintaining club memberships can provide social engagement,
            which is essential for mental health and well-being,” Shirshikov said.




            This is particularly true of fitness and wellness programs beneficial for boomers’ post-work life.




            “Staying active is crucial at any age, especially in retirement. Programs tailored to older adults can help maintain
            mobility, strength and mental health,” Shirshikov said.




            ## Emergency Fund




            Just because someone is retired does not mean that accidents won’t happen and that life will be smooth sailing
            from that point on. Lots of emergencies can pop up, so it’s important to stay financially ahead of the game with
            some quick money on hand.




            “Unexpected expenses can arise at any time, and [having an emergency fund](https://www.gobankingrates.com/saving-money/savings-advice/how-much-emergency-fund/?hyperlink_type=manual&utm_term=incontent_link_7&utm_campaign=1312535&utm_source=yahoo.com&utm_content=10&utm_medium=rss)
            in retirement can provide peace of mind and financial stability,” Collins said. “Boomers should always have a
            designated emergency fund to cover any unexpected costs.”

            # How to save for a down payment

            1




















            ## Key takeaways




            - There are many strategies to save for a down payment, including maximizing your savings, reducing everyday expenses
            and applying for down payment assistance.


            - You don’t have to save 20 percent for a down payment on a home. Conventional mortgages require just 3 percent
            down, and FHA loans require only 3.5 percent down.


            - More than half (52 percent) of aspiring homeowners cite the down payment and closing costs as a “very significant”
            obstacle to homeownership, according to a Bankrate survey.



            More than half (52 percent) of aspiring homeowners cite the [down payment](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-is-down-payment/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=oaXehwvzdut9KaKw0016)
            and [closing costs](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-are-closing-costs/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=jRDUWB2dfNroV0HV1016)
            as a “very significant” obstacle to homeownership, according to Bankrate’s 2025 [Home Affordability Report](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/home-affordability-report/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=H52ViBt5SkuT2lXx2016).


            Here are our top ways to save for a down payment, advice on how much to put down and a rundown of other costs
            to consider.


            ## How much do you need for a down payment?


            Most mortgage down payment requirements are far lower than the oft-heard 20 percent. Here’s how the different
            loan types compare:


            |     |     |     |     |

            | --- | --- | --- | --- |

            | **Loan type** | **Minimum down payment** | **Minimum credit score** | **Mortgage insurance** |

            | [Conventional loan](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-is-a-conventional-loan/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=rLh8aJ6hvzLbDg6S3016)
            | 3% | 620 | [Private mortgage insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/basics-of-private-mortgage-insurance-pmi/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=e5bC5AAI5gcM6sAv4017)
            with a down payment of less than 20% |

            | [FHA loans](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-is-an-fha-loan/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=6yexgXeUfA8iBT4H5017)
            | 3.5% for credit scores 580 and up/10% for credit scores 500-579 | 580/500 | [FHA mortgage insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/fha-mortgage-insurance-guide/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=XI3nST8gzWoHlUlj6017)
            with a down payment of less than 20% |

            | [VA loan](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/understanding-va-loans/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=783Wvof4RldU4cJT7017)
            | None | Varies by lender, but generally 620 | None |

            | [USDA loan](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-is-a-usda-loan/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=WSBOGNuPEPqAOzZZ8017)
            | None | Varies by lender, but generally 640 | None |

            | [Jumbo loan](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-is-jumbo-mortgage/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=xLSuF654pEhAQKk99017)
            | 10%-20% | Varies by lender, but often 700 | Varies by lender |


            Of course, your minimum down payment is just one piece of the puzzle. The cost of the home you buy will also be
            a major factor in your down payment.


            While the median home price in the U.S. was a record-setting $435,300 in June, according to the National Association
            of Realtors (NAR), the home price you can expect to find varies by region and even metro area. For example, the
            median home price in the West in June was $636,100, but the median in the Midwest was $337,600, and the median
            home price in Detroit was $293,900.


            Once you’ve decided [how much home you can afford](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/new-house-calculator/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=HldR3LD7YSLqkYqs10017),
            you can start deciding how much to put down on your house and making a savings plan for your down payment.


            **What''s the typical down payment on a home?**


            The median down payment for all homebuyers is 18 percent, according to the National Association of Realtors. First-time
            homebuyers make a median down payment of 9 percent.

            ## How to save for a down payment: 8 ways


            There are several ways to save for a house:


            ### 1\. Park the savings in a high-yield account


            While you might be worried about [mortgage rates](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-rates/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=xVh2SygAVvhtreSx12017)
            that are much higher than they were in recent years, the current interest rate environment is great news for your
            savings. Select banks and credit unions are paying upwards of 4 percent APY on deposits. If your money is currently
            stashed in an account that pays minimal interest, think about moving it to a:


            Story Continues


            - [**High-yield savings account:**](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/what-is-a-high-yield-savings-account/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=RwXYnEKsZF1sljuP13017)
            High-yield savings accounts offer significantly higher earning potential than standard savings accounts. Some
            currently pay between 4 and 5 percent, as opposed to 0.01 percent at some big-name banks.


            - [**Money market account:**](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/money-market/rates/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=wVuP3FtPiIrS77OD14017)
            Money market accounts are a cross between a checking and savings account that may offer higher rates than standard
            savings accounts.


            - [**Certificate of deposit (CD):**](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/cds/cd-rates/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=MCrd95yF6UVhMZdc15017)
            CDs are fixed-rate savings products with fixed terms. You make a deposit and earn a set return until the maturity
            date arrives. But before signing up for a CD, keep your homebuying timeline in mind. If you’re planning to buy
            in the next year, and you put your savings in an 18-month CD, you’ll likely pay a penalty for withdrawing the
            money early. On the other hand, if you have a few years before you plan to buy, consider doing a [CD ladder](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/cds/cd-ladder-guide/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=34hnCx1o47g8ptzP16017)
            to account for changing interest rates and avoid being tied into a single, long-term CD.



            ### 2\. Automate your savings


            With this approach, you’ll set up automated deposits of a portion of your income into an account for your down
            payment. For employees with a regular paycheck, you can ask your employer to split your direct deposits between
            your down payment and other accounts. For freelancers, contractors or business owners, you can schedule a regular,
            automatic transfer to your down payment account.


            ### 3\. Explore additional sources of income


            If you have the spare time and energy, another income source or a [side hustle](https://www.bankrate.com/investing/best-side-hustles/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=WbPRuhAEhMEZoFeg17017)
            can help you save for a down payment. You might even be able to turn a hobby into a money-making proposition.


            ### 4\. Look for down payment assistance programs


            [Down payment assistance](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/down-payment-assistance/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=PwnqD2H7ylqgl4pL18017)
            could be an option if you’re struggling to save, especially if you’re a [first-time buyer](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/first-time-homebuyer-loans-and-programs/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=ChP9bR03VioeFtOe19017).
            This assistance can come in various forms, from deferred or forgivable loans to grants. Each program has different
            eligibility requirements, usually based on income and location. Start your search with your area’s local or state
            housing authority.


            ### 5\. Reduce your expenses


            If you’re saving for a house, cutting back on your spending can help. Here’s how:


            - **Lower discretionary spending.** These are expenses like subscription services, entertainment, delivery services
            or eating out. While you won’t want to cut out this spending entirely, consider ways to spend less.


            - **Save money on your bills.** If possible, negotiate recurring monthly or annual expenses, such as shopping
            around for a better rate on car insurance or reducing an internet bill.


            - **Pay down existing debt.** A lower debt load will make you a better candidate for a mortgage, and once you’ve
            eliminated these payments, you can redirect money to your down payment fund.



            While not an option for everyone, if you’re able to, moving back into your parents’ house or moving in with a
            roommate can help you save for a down payment as well. Nearly one-quarter (24 percent) of aspiring homeowners
            willing to do something to find more affordable housing would take this step, according to our 2025 Home Affordability
            Report.


            ### 6\. Request a raise


            While each company’s financial situation and performance measures vary, you might be able to [get paid more](https://www.bankrate.com/personal-finance/ask-for-raise-in-tough-times/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=R6crqfokwIZVyZbI20017),
            especially if you’ve made valuable contributions at work recently. Come to the discussion prepared, outlining
            the work you’ve done and how it impacted the company’s bottom line.


            ### 7\. Ask for a gift


            Many first-time homebuyers have turned to family members for help with a down payment. If a family member or friend
            is willing to give you some funds for your home, be sure to document this in a [gift letter](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/gift-letter-for-mortgage/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=BDNVdNLAqlj3xS2421017)
            for your lender.


            ### 8\. Reprioritize your savings goals


            Your down payment isn’t the only reason you’re stashing money away. As you think about buying a home, take a holistic
            look at your finances. If you’re young, and you regularly contribute to a 401(k) or an IRA, consider reducing
            those contributions temporarily and saving more for your home purchase. Just remember to save enough to qualify
            for your company match, if you have one — and resume your former contributions once you’ve met your down payment
            savings goal.


            **Don''t forget your emergency fund**


            It’s important to keep your down payment savings separate from your [emergency fund](https://www.bankrate.com/banking/savings/starting-an-emergency-fund/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=pGyV8lJJVXmnzEvH22017),
            which should contain three to six months of living expenses. Unless you have much more in this account than you
            need, it shouldn’t fund your down payment. Once you buy a home, you’ll need that extra cushion to deal with the
            routine maintenance and repairs that come with being a homeowner.


            ## How long should you plan to save for a down payment?


            How long you should save for a down payment depends on how much money you’re putting down and how much you can
            set aside each month. Location plays a big role in your savings goal. A 10 percent down payment on a house in
            San Jose, California, is going to be larger than one for the same house in Jackson, Mississippi.


            Timing is another important factor when saving for a house. You might opt to put less money down and pay a higher
            [mortgage rate](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/30-year-mortgage-rates/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=s9N62OYyX0Rt3cE823017)
            in exchange for owning a home sooner.


            To see how much your down payment will affect your monthly mortgage payment, run the numbers with our [mortgage
            down payment calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/down-payment-calculator/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=38oTVcLA5hrWMWp724017).


            ## Other costs to save for when buying a home


            While the down payment is the biggest homebuying expense for most people, there are other costs you need to factor
            in, including:


            - ​​ **Closing costs**: Closing costs might include an origination fee, title insurance fee, appraisal fee and
            more. These typically cost 2 to 5 percent of your mortgage’s principal amount.


            - [**Mortgage reserves**](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/cash-reserves-for-mortgage/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=4gU8CN8HxFIcVYCg25018):
            Depending on your credit or financial situation, your lender might require you to have several months’ worth of
            mortgage payments in reserves.


            - **Maintenance and other hidden expenses:** The typical single-family home costs more than $18,000 a year in
            costs like maintenance, repairs, homeowners insurance, property taxes and energy bills, according to Bankrate’s
            2024 [Hidden Costs of Homeownership Study.](https://www.bankrate.com/home-equity/hidden-costs-of-homeownership-study/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=1egJUjb706UTJSNq26018)


            - **Moving expenses**: Depending on the distance and amount of stuff you’re moving, the costs can add up.



            - **Methodology**


            **For Bankrate’s Home Affordability Report:**


            The survey on down payments was conducted by YouGov Plc. between Jan. 15-17, 2025. Total sample size was 2,408
            adults, of which 1,270 were homeowners. The survey was carried out online. It employed a non-probability-based
            sample using both quotas upfront during collection and then a weighting scheme on the back end designed and proven
            to provide nationally representative results.


            The survey on homeownership and the American Dream was conducted by YouGov Plc. All figures, unless otherwise
            stated, are from YouGov Plc. Total sample size was 2,317 adults. Fieldwork was undertaken between March 6-8, 2024.

            collection and then a weighting scheme on the back end designed and proven to provide nationally representative
            results.


            **For Bankrate’s Hidden Costs of Homeownership Study:**


            Bankrate’s Hidden Costs of Homeownership Study analyzes the average annual expenses associated with owning and
            maintaining a single-family home nationwide and in every state in 2024 compared to 2020. Bankrate defines those
            expenses as costs that go beyond a mortgage, including property taxes, homeowners insurance, energy costs, internet
            and cable bills and home maintenance.Average annual nationwide and statewide home maintenance costs were estimated
            using the [2 percent rule of thumb](https://yourhome.fanniemae.com/own/how-build-your-maintenance-and-repair-budget?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication)
            multiplied by national and statewide median sale prices for single-family homes as of March 2020 and March 2024.

            for single-family homes as of March 2020 and March 2024 on May 1, 2024. Average annual national and statewide
            electric bills, which include electricity, natural gas, propane and fuel oil or kerosene costs, were collected
            using [2020 data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration](https://www.eia.gov/consumption/residential/data/2020/index.php?view=state&mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication#ce).
            Average annual national and statewide internet and cable bills were collected using 2021 and [2023 data](https://www.doxo.com/w/insights/u-s-cable-internet-market-size-and-household-spending-report-2023/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication)

            in 2024, Bankrate adjusted the most up-to-date national and statewide figures for property taxes, energy costs,
            internet and cable bills and homeowners insurance premiums for inflation using the Consumer Price Index. In the
            2020 portion of the analysis, national and statewide 2021 figures for internet and cable were converted to 2020
            dollars using the Consumer Price Index. Bankrate’s study did not include mortgage payments or any other monthly
            expenses or debts.

            # When is my first mortgage payment due?














            [Mia Taylor](https://finance.yahoo.com/author/)

            ## Key takeaways




            - To find the due date of your first mortgage payment, add 30 days to your closing date, then find the first day
            of the following month.


            - When you make mortgage payments, you’re paying for the previous month, not the current month.


            - You have several options for paying your mortgage, such as setting up autopay or paying online through your
            servicer’s portal.



            ## When is the first mortgage payment due?


            The due date for your first mortgage payment is based on your mortgage [closing date](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/closing-day/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=C2YBP9VDjPlLckvC27018).
            You must typically begin making payments one full month (30 days) after your mortgage closing date, on the first
            day of the month following the end of that 30-day period.


            **Example of when a first mortgage payment is due**


            Say you close on your mortgage on March 12. Adding a month brings you to April 12, which would mean your mortgage
            due date would be on the first day of the following month: May 1. While it may seem like you’re skipping a payment,
            you’re not. That’s because your mortgage payments are for the previous month, not the current month.


            The [documents you receive at closing](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/paperwork-needed-to-buy-house/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=z1YyFBH9t7pDYxKN28018)
            specify the due date of your first mortgage payment, typically in something called the “First Payment Letter.”
            This also outlines the amount of principal and interest you’ll pay each month, along with any tax payments that
            are part of your monthly mortgage bill.


            ### Can you change the due date of your first mortgage payment?


            In some cases, homebuyers can prepay interest, and even a portion of a mortgage payment, at closing. This can
            move the first full mortgage payment up to two months — or 60 days — after closing has taken place. Keep in mind
            that months with 31 days can impact your ability to adjust your first payment.


            “This is a closing strategy that many loan officers discuss with their clients,” says Chris Parks, sales manager
            for Churchill Mortgage. “An example would be closing in August, skipping the August and September payments and
            then having your first payment due in October.”


            If the lender allows, many homebuyers also try to strategically time closing with the end of an apartment lease
            or the sale of an existing home. This can help avoid juggling rent and a mortgage or multiple mortgage payments.


            “Changing the mortgage due date is especially important for cash flow. Moving is expensive. So are [closing costs,](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-are-closing-costs/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=HjxyOHtGOQBfSAkN29018)
            furnishing a new home and paying for a home warranty. Giving yourself as long as possible to build up your funds
            or to align with payday is a smart move,” says Jonathan Palley, CEO of Clever Tiny Homes.


            ### Can you change the due date of your ongoing mortgage payment?


            Some lenders let you adjust the due date of your ongoing mortgage payment — for example, from the 1st of the month
            to the 10th — especially if you request it during closing. Some don’t. Ask your [lender](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-servicer-vs-lender/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=uwKwhwbKfYNKmraL30018)
            about its policies.

            ## How much is your first mortgage payment?


            The amount of your first mortgage payment is listed in your closing disclosure, a document you’ll receive at least
            three days before closing. Each of your mortgage payments includes:


            - Loan principal


            - Interest


            - Taxes (if you pay through your mortgage servicer)


            - Homeowners insurance (if you pay through your mortgage servicer)



            The acronym PITI stands for these main components of your mortgage payment: principal, interest, taxes and insurance.
            However, your payment may also contain other components, such [private mortgage insurance (PMI)](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/basics-of-private-mortgage-insurance-pmi/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=8t2JwAyWkxwxocZs31018)
            or fees charged by your homeowners association, if you have one.


            For fixed-rate mortgages, the principal and interest payments will remain the same for the life of the loan. However,
            other costs that make up your monthly payment pay change. For example, your property taxes or homeowners insurance
            premiums may increase over time.


            **Example of how much a first mortgage payment costs**


            Say you bought a house for $350,000 at a 6.8 percent [interest rate](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/30-year-mortgage-rates/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=ROBdnfBgfxTC2P1F32018)
            and put down 10 percent. Using Bankrate’s [mortgage payment calculator](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-calculator/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=d3YJdMUNJrzrgf3833018),
            your monthly mortgage payment would be about $2,350, with around $2,054 going toward the principal and interest
            and the rest going toward property taxes and insurance.


            Your mortgage’s first payment will largely go toward interest, based on your loan’s [amortization schedule](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/amortization-calculator/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=yUKZWP0Pp8ftt9TY34018).
            While your first year of homeowner’s insurance premiums are often included with closing costs, you can expect
            to pay each month toward your annual property tax and insurance costs.

            ## How to make your first mortgage payment


            You can choose one of many methods to [pay your mortgage](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/making-mortgage-payment/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=gQxcVuEONiTIi9e036018),
            including:


            1. **Autopay.** Almost all lenders allow you to pay your mortgage via recurring, electronic payments. This way,
            you’ll avoid missed payments and late fees — but you can also schedule larger-than-required payments to [pay off
            your mortgage](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-happens-when-mortgage-is-paid-off/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=mTOx7gZy6ebTWg4e37018)
            early and save on [mortgage interest](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-rates/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=ASj36Bas7wZIyO3a38018).
            Some lenders offer discounts for autopay.


            2. **Online.** You can also manually make payments through your lender’s portal or app. If you plan to [pay off
            your house early](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/early-payoff/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=4dyOYHeH7X7HXp4b39019),
            but you can’t commit to making extra payments each month, this is an easy way to pay toward your principal when
            you have space in your budget.


            3. **By mail.** If you prefer, you can send your monthly payment by mail using a personal check, cashier’s check
            or money order. Always include your mortgage account number on your check and allow enough time for delivery to
            avoid late charges.


            4. **By phone.** Your mortgage statement will also include a number you can call to make a mortgage payment. You’ll
            need your mortgage account number and bank account — or other payment — information. There may be a service charge
            for phone payments.



            If you want to [prepay your mortgage](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/prepaying-your-mortgage/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=JdV11wOM2zh1ULQA40019),
            make sure your servicer applies the extra payments to the principal balance of the loan. This is not a default
            for many lenders.

            ## What happens if you miss a mortgage payment?


            If you miss your [mortgage payment](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/average-monthly-mortgage-payment/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=c59bvn5neiKZLeIO42019),
            be sure to pay as soon as possible. Most lenders offer a grace period, during which you can make a payment without
            a late fee or other consequences. Keep in mind that, while one late payment likely won’t result in your eviction,
            repeated delinquencies could harm your credit and lead to foreclosure.


            “Missing a payment is a big deal. By missing a payment, you are putting into question your ability to repay the
            debt and will incur additional scrutiny on any further transactions,” Parks says.


            Late payments can also cause other issues. According to Parks, some lenders will disqualify you from another mortgage
            or a refinance if you’re more than 30 days late two times during the same 12-month period.


            If your payments are no longer affordable, contact your lender. You may qualify for a [loan modification](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/loan-modification-or-refinance-whats-better-for-borrowers/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=Df1ZnK1ylG9CxQzJ43019),
            repayment plan or a temporary payment reduction.


            ## FAQ


            - **Why is the first month’s mortgage payment more?**


            As soon as you close on your mortgage, interest starts accruing. So if you close in the middle of a month — for
            example, March 12 — you’ll owe interest for each day between the closing and the last day of the month. This is
            known as [per diem interest](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/per-diem-interest/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=WJN0x0s49TD0Zgzd44019).


            Many lenders require you to prepay your per diem interest on closing day. But some will roll it into your first
            mortgage payment. In the latter case, your first month’s mortgage payment is more than your normal payment.


            - **Will my lender tell me when my first mortgage payment is due?**


            Your lender should provide your first payment due date in your closing paperwork. Otherwise, you can usually find
            the due date in your online mortgage account.


            If you haven’t heard from your lender or can’t access your online account, reach out and confirm the payment due
            date. Typically, it’s the first of the month after you’ve owned the home for 30 days. So, if you closed on March
            12, your first payment would be due May 1.

            # How to lower your mortgage payment














            [Mia Taylor](https://finance.yahoo.com/author/)




            Wed, August 13, 2025 at 12:48 PM EDT9 min read










































            ## Key takeaways




            - To get a lower mortgage payment, you’ll likely need to focus on modifying the principal, interest, taxes or
            insurance you pay.


            - You might choose to refinance or recast your mortgage to make the monthly mortgage payments more affordable.


            - Addressing your property tax bill or eliminating PMI are other effective ways to get a break on your monthly
            housing costs.



            Your mortgage payment is probably your biggest expense every month. But is it possible to make it smaller, and
            thus free up funds to meet other financial goals? There _are_ ways to lower your mortgage payments, but they may
            not all be right for your situation. Here’s what to know so you can make the best decision for you.


            ## How can I lower my mortgage payment?


            Mortgage payments consist of four parts, often abbreviated to the acronym [PITI](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/piti/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=QusDLk4H6A6xekW545019):
            principal, interest, taxes (property) and insurance (homeowners and/or private mortgage insurance). Lowering your
            payments means addressing one or more of these elements. Options to reduce mortgage payments include:


            1. Refinance to lower your [interest rate](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-rates/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=hUxaS8Icf0VD8sm846019)


            2. Recast your mortgage


            3. Eliminate your mortgage insurance


            4. Modify your loan


            5. Lower your taxes


            6. Shop around for a lower homeowners insurance rate


            7. Apply for mortgage forbearance



            ## 1\. Refinance to lower your interest rate


            [Refinancing](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-does-refinancing-a-mortgage-work/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=NjEWIBS1BBbfMV3s47019)
            involves replacing your current mortgage with a new one. In a basic rate-and-term refinance, your new loan offers
            a lower interest rate, a longer term or both.


            Several factors influence whether you’ll want (or be able) to refinance, including:


            - [**Current refinance interest rates**](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/refinance-rates/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=coZGs2LBPtxbMBFs48019)
            **:** Fees and [closing costs](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/how-much-it-costs-to-refinance/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=ouXnl9PiFry0pYWC49019)
            come with a refi, just as they did with your original loan, so consider whether rates are low enough to justify
            the switch. Looking for a drop of at least 1 percentage point is a good rule of thumb.


            - **How long you’ll be in your home:** Do you [plan to stay in your home](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/when-to-refinance/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=D5wJTgOoG23dE8Ty50019)
            long enough to recoup the refinance closing costs? Usually, that means a couple of years at least.


            - **Penalties for paying your loan off early:** Many mortgages come with a [prepayment penalty](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/prepayment-penalty/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=n0lKPiaKM9Sx6sEp51020),
            especially if the [mortgage originated](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/home-loan-origination-process/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=QDJDM9G8LppQprk352020)
            less than three years ago. If it does, refinancing to lower your payment may not make sense.


            - **Age of your mortgage:** Many lenders won’t allow refinances for loans that closed within four to five months.
            But if your loan is recent enough that its [amortization schedule](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/amortization-calculator/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=Ecrroau0Dn9doRpf53020)
            still includes interest-heavy payments, it may be worth refinancing.



            If you don’t qualify for a lower rate, you can often buy one by purchasing [mortgage discount points](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/mortgage-points/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=0IYyZAYu6wb6wiW754020).
            A form of prepaid interest, each mortgage point is the equivalent of 1 percent of the principal amount and shaves
            0.25 percent off the interest rate. This is also called “buying down the rate.”


            Story Continues


            Bear in mind that using mortgage points increases your upfront costs in refinancing. So that will extend the amount
            of time you need to stay in the house to reach the break-even point that makes the refinance worthwhile.


            “Refinancing works great when you can trade a higher rate for a lower rate — but mortgage rates have to cooperate,
            which is making this difficult at present,” says Greg McBride, Bankrate’s chief financial analyst. “There are
            also costs to refinancing, whether you pay them out-of-pocket or roll them into the loan.”


            ## 2\. Recast your mortgage


            Another approach is to attempt what’s called [mortgage recasting](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/what-is-mortgage-recasting-and-why-do-it/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=zuijWRZdPpOzu6y855020).
            With this option, you make a lump-sum payment toward the principal. Then, your lender recalculates your monthly
            payments based on that new balance (but on the same loan term). The reduced loan amount means smaller monthly
            payments and less total interest paid over the course of the loan.


            - To illustrate how this works, let’s say you have a $300,000, 30-year mortgage with a 6 percent interest rate.
            Your current monthly payment is $1,798 for principal and interest.


            - Once you make payments for three years, your balance is about $288,250. You receive an inheritance and choose
            to make a $75,000 payment to lower the principal balance.


            - The principal balance on your loan will drop to $213,250. Once it’s recast, you’ll get a lower monthly payment
            of $1,278, which is roughly $500 lower than your initial loan payment amount.



            Before proceeding, however, make sure you understand the negative sides to this approach. “The two main drawbacks
            of recasting are the need to come up with a significant lump sum to be applied to the balance and a lender that
            will recast the loan,” says McBride. “Check with your loan servicer to see if this is possible before devoting
            extra cash toward the principal.”


            In addition, most lenders charge a recasting fee — typically between $250 and $500. Make sure to do the math to
            ensure it’s the best decision for your overall financial situation.


            ## 3\. Eliminate your mortgage insurance


            If you are paying [private mortgage insurance](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/basics-of-private-mortgage-insurance-pmi/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=Dw6qGtgg2rf8RPMr56020)
            (PMI), look into whether you can eliminate that. PMI is assessed by most lenders on conventional loans when the
            down payment is less than 20 percent of the purchase price. It costs homeowners between 0.46 percent and 1.50
            percent of the loan amount each month, depending on your credit score, according to 2024 data from the [Urban
            Institute](https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/2024-11/November%202024%20Chartbook%20Final.pdf?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication).
            However, you can request to have it removed once you have 20 percent equity in your home.


            “If your home has appreciated to the point that your current mortgage balance is less than 80 percent of the market
            value, you can ask the loan servicer to eliminate your mortgage insurance,” says McBride. “You may need to pay
            for an appraisal, and there is often a two-year seasoning requirement — meaning the loan has to be at least that
            old — before you can have the PMI premium removed.”


            Let’s say you owe $250,000 on your mortgage, and you’re paying 0.5 percent PMI. That comes to $1,250 annually,
            or about $104 per month. So, eliminating your PMI payment would save you more than $100 per month.


            ## 4\. Modify your loan


            If you’re in financial distress, the government offers [loan modification programs](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/loan-modification-strategy/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=mwAtWFXx6Q3FLp8F57020)
            aimed at helping with financial hardships. A modification typically changes the loan’s rate or term (or both)
            to make monthly payments more affordable. It’s [similar to refinancing](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/loan-modification-or-refinance-whats-better-for-borrowers/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=Q60zqgGf3GiOCdcB58020),
            only with the same loan instead of a new one.


            For example, you could extend a 30-year mortgage into a 40-year loan — then your payments will be lower, since
            they’ll be spread out over another decade. But bear in mind you’ll end up paying more in interest this way. “Yes,
            it will reduce your monthly payments, but you’ll have many more months of payments to make, so the savings is
            a bit of an illusion,” says McBride.


            Not every lender will allow loan modifications, and there are stringent eligibility rules. And even if you get
            it, the difference may be too small to justify the eventual higher total cost of the loan due to paying interest
            for a longer period.


            ## 5\. Lower your taxes


            Other methods that can reduce payments don’t have to do with the mortgage loan itself. For example, you might
            try to lower the [property tax](https://www.bankrate.com/real-estate/property-tax-by-state/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=9kmJl8CmiO6zYIaE59020)
            amount that typically takes up a chunk of your monthly mortgage payment. Tax assessments are sometimes too high
            following real estate market corrections or local rezonings, for instance. If you think that could be the case
            for your house, consider appealing your property’s value to the relevant state or local decision-makers. Be aware
            of deadlines for filing an appeal if you go this route.


            If the home is your legal primary residence, you could also try applying for a homestead tax exemption. Rules
            vary by state, but if you qualify, an exemption can reduce your tax bill by sheltering an eligible portion of
            your home’s assessed value from taxes.


            ## 6\. Look for a lower homeowners insurance rate


            When was the last time you shopped around for homeowners insurance? Even if you haven’t had any issues with your
            current provider, [better rates](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/cheap-homeowners-insurance/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=aLnhaQz5Bkif9Ug660020)
            may be available elsewhere.


            Compare quotes from several reputable providers, and be sure to inquire about any rate discounts that may be available
            to you. Also, review the rate quotes to ensure the coverages included are comparable to your current policy, and
            ask about other ways to [curb costs](https://www.bankrate.com/insurance/homeowners-insurance/keep-home-insurance-cost-down/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=Hc142z50DHwvKRWO61020),
            like increasing your deductible.


            ## 7\. Apply for mortgage forbearance


            If all else fails and you’re in dire straits, you can talk to your lender about potentially putting your payments
            on hold for a while. [Mortgage forbearance](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/everything-you-should-know-about-mortgage-forbearance/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=8xIeybK39Q81jUuA62020)
            can offer temporary relief by lowering or pausing your payments for a short period. You’ll also avoid adverse
            credit reporting and foreclosure, and gain time to get your finances back in order.


            Be mindful that the lender will likely require you to prove you’re experiencing financial hardship before approving
            you for forbearance. And it’s only a temporary reprieve. The payments you miss (including interest) must be paid
            eventually, in a lump sum or over time with a repayment plan. If you choose the latter, your monthly payment could
            increase significantly.


            ## FAQs


            - **What happens if I can’t pay my mortgage anymore?**


            If you’re unable to pay your mortgage, contact your mortgage servicer immediately. Possible options for assistance
            via your lender include refinancing, loan modification, repayment plans, forbearance, short-selling your home
            or giving your home back through a [deed-in-lieu of foreclosure](https://www.bankrate.com/mortgages/deed-in-lieu-of-foreclosure/?mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication&uuid=FNtLN6t29ibqB8Lh63020).
            You can also reach out to a [HUD-approved housing counseling agency](https://hud4.my.site.com/housingcounseling/s/?language=en_US&mf_ct_campaign=yahoo-synd-feed&utm_content=syndication)
            for free help in avoiding foreclosure. If you’re facing foreclosure or legal papers, you might also need legal
            advice.


            - **Does paying extra into escrow lower my monthly payments?**


            No, adding extra money to your escrow account usually doesn’t reduce your monthly mortgage payment, nor will it
            impact your loan principal. However, you can deposit additional funds into escrow whenever you like, which can
            help prevent any shortages in the account. Your extra contributions may remain in the account for an extended
            period without being used.


            - **Will my mortgage payment go down if I pay extra?**


            No, making extra payments on your mortgage does not reduce your monthly payment. Instead, additional payments
            applied toward your principal balance will help pay down the loan faster, shortening its term, but your monthly
            payment will remain the same.

            # Are CDs Really Better Than a Financial Advisor? Here''s What to Consider




            Ask an Advisor: ''Prove Me Wrong.'' I Think Investing in CDs Is a Better Deal Than Working With an Advisor

            **Why hire a financial advisor who will take around 1% percent of your assets per year when you can get a certificate
            of deposit (CD) at over 5% with no fee? That alone amounts to a 6% return on your money. One can get a brokerage
            CD for two years at 5.5%, and with no fee, the return is 6.5%. I will take that any day instead of worrying about
            what the market is doing and can sleep at night. That’s especially true as a retired person who is not dollar-cost
            averaging anymore. Prove me wrong.**




            **-Chris**




            While, at face value, a two-year [certificate of deposit (CD)](https://smartasset.com/checking-account/what-is-a-certificate-of-deposit?uuid=XLxbXud4SkrWxEQ164020)
            offers a seemingly low-risk, guaranteed return opportunity for savers and investors right now, a strategy that
            relies solely on CDs is unlikely to meet your needs and objectives.




            Here are several points to consider before discounting the value of a successful advisor relationship and pursuing
            opportunities like CDs alone.

            **Is a CD the Right Choice for Your Goals, Objectives and Needs?**


            Ask an Advisor: ''Prove Me Wrong.'' I Think Investing in CDs Is a Better Deal Than Working With an Advisor


            A trusted advisor can work with you to create and follow an [asset allocation strategy](https://smartasset.com/investing/asset-allocation-calculator?uuid=5EAWtx6CXg4SEFEO66021)
            that provides liquidity and flexibility while managing risk throughout the various stages of your life. A CD represents
            one tool an advisor may use. But allocating your investments across various investment types is more effective
            in managing risk.




            Consider this: Before 2022, similar questions arose about going all in on S&P 500 index funds instead of working
            with an advisor. Because economic conditions have changed, that question has given way to one about CDs.




            But despite the common tendency to pile into the opportunity du jour, studies have shown that proper asset allocation
            for your unique personal situation best protects you from over-exposure to any single sector, investment or risk
            factor in changing environments or at different life stages.




            Yes, a retired individual will generally be suited to [conservative investments](https://smartasset.com/investing/investment-calculator?uuid=LMmlnY1YrlwyXOhz67021).
            But retirees still face the risk of outliving their assets. And they need an asset allocation that addresses this.
            Thinking narrowly with a CD-only strategy could be imprudent when considering longevity risk, unexpected expenses
            in retirement and rapidly increasing healthcare costs.




            **The Client-Advisor Relationship Extends Beyond Investments**


            Ask an Advisor: ''Prove Me Wrong.'' I Think Investing in CDs Is a Better Deal Than Working With an Advisor


            [Advisory fees](https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/financial-advisor-cost?uuid=Jubc1CXOuqITGOny68021) can
            represent a worthwhile investment to clients given the comprehensive plan an advisor delivers and manages. This
            is where an advisor can add significant value. An advisor will approach your life plan holistically, factoring
            in Social Security, taxes, risk management, estate planning and other aspects of managing your assets.






            Story Continues






            Commonly, fees are paid as a percentage of your account value. If your advisor manages $100,000 for you and charges
            1% annually, you’d pay her $1,000 per year. The question correctly assumes you would save this 1% by investing
            in the CD without an advisor. However, the savings do not add to your returns, as the question indicates.




            Studies have shown that an advisor’s fee often pays for itself. [According to Vanguard](https://advisors.vanguard.com/iwe/pdf/IARCQAA.pdf),
            the “alpha” an advisor can generate relative to an individual investor is estimated at 3% of net gains or more.




            [Get matched with a fiduciary financial advisor](https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&utm_content=askanadvisorcertificatesofdeposit&uuid=u0HXd1NytaI4MdYn69021)
            to start working toward your goals.




            **Investment Considerations Surrounding a CD**




            Even though CDs appear like a low-risk option, they are not risk-free and still expose you to the following risk
            types:




            **Reinvestment Risk**




            [Reinvestment risk](https://smartasset.com/investing/reinvestment-rate-risk-definition-and-strategies?uuid=KFuKjq29rFoc8Mep70021)
            occurs when a similarly high rate might not be available at the end of the investment term. If rates pull back
            before your CD matures, you won’t be able to reinvest for the same interest rate.




            **Shifting Promotional Rates**




            Banks and credit unions often advertise promotional CD rates that expire after irregular terms and are automatically
            reinvested at standard rates. If, for example, you secure a 5.5% promotional rate, it may be in effect for a short
            time.




            At the promotional period’s expiration, you may find yourself locked into a longer-term CD at a lower interest
            rate. For this reason, when evaluating whether to choose a CD of any duration, [annual percentage rate](https://smartasset.com/investing/apr-vs-apy?uuid=F1hqPWnyGwYfee0W71021)
            (APR) estimates often decrease for longer terms.




            **Call Risk**




            Brokerage CDs, in particular, often carry the risk of being called. This means that if you purchase a CD from
            an issuer that anticipates interest rate declines, it may redeem your CD early, reducing your expected return.




            A [financial advisor](https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevant&utm_content=askanadvisorcertificatesofdeposit&uuid=K9DpAR1iRReJ9L7x72021)
            can help you navigate the various risks involved with investing.




            **Inflation and Real Returns**




            You will also want to consider [inflation](https://smartasset.com/investing/inflation-calculator?uuid=gCcPCJ3vfrF1mbl673021).
            At a 5% to 6% current rate, the real return on your CD’s nominal 5.5% rate is closer to 0%. A two-year CD investment
            alone will not preserve your purchasing power if inflation persists at current levels.




            **Liquidity Needs**




            CDs can tie your money up for months or years, depending on the term you select. If unexpected expenses occur,
            and you need to access your money, you may face stiff financial penalties for redeeming them early. A knowledgeable
            advisor will work with you to pursue various courses to mitigate these risks.




            **Bottom Line**




            For the first time in a long time, rates have risen to levels that make CDs and other fixed-income instruments
            appear more attractive. But a strategy that relies only on CDs is not right for everyone, including those in retirement.
            These instruments do not replace the value that a financial advisor can offer or eliminate all risks. The holistic
            approach an advisor takes to managing your wealth can increase your chances of achieving your financial goals.

            have to be hard. [SmartAsset’s free tool](https://smartasset.com/retirement/find-a-financial-planner?utm_source=syndication_yahoo&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=sma__falc_relevantbottom&utm_content=askanadvisorcertificatesofdeposit&utm_term=rp&uuid=nVkiRmYhGMOEOB4y75021) matches

            - Consider a few advisors before settling on one. It’s important to make sure you find someone you trust to manage
            your money. As you consider your options, these are the [questions you should ask an advisor](https://smartasset.com/financial-advisor/5-questions-to-ask-when-choosing-a-financial-advisor?uuid=ZqvRvq3hcUKSGb4M77021) to
            ensure you make the right choice.


            - Keep an emergency fund on hand in case you run into unexpected expenses. An emergency fund should be liquid
            -- in an account that isn''t at risk of significant fluctuation like the stock market. The tradeoff is that the
            value of liquid cash can be eroded by inflation. But a high-interest account allows you to earn compound interest. [Compare

            - **Hougan noted that a potential reduction in interest rates, combined with a drop in the US Dollar, is positive
            for Bitcoin.**

            - **He added that SEC Chair Paul Atkins'' desire for the rebirth of ICOs could be a catalyst for price growth.**


            The crypto market could witness a strong uptrend in the coming months from four key price catalysts, including
            government demand, a weak US Dollar, low volatility, and potential rebirth of the ICO market, according to Bitwise
            CIO Matt Hougan in a report on Wednesday.


            ## **Crypto could see further upside with four growing developments**


            The crypto market is yet to capitalize on four opportunities that could be potential triggers for price growth,
            Hougan stated in a note to investors on Wednesday.


            Although Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) continue to hover near their record highs, Hougan suggests that these
            "four big developments" are yet to be priced in by market participants.


            Firstly, he highlighted that more governments and nations will start adding crypto to their reserve assets. Investors
            had earlier anticipated demand from government, corporate treasuries, and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to be "The
            Three Horsemen of Bitcoin Demand," due to their capacity to drive prices higher.


            "So far, two of those horsemen have delivered: ETFs have purchased 183,126 BTC, while public corporations have
            gobbled up 354,744 BTC," Hougan stated.


            However, demand from government reserves has been weak, causing several experts to play down their potential impact
            on prices. This notion was reinforced by US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who stated in an interview with
            FOX Business on Thursday that the government won''t be purchasing Bitcoin directly. He said the US Strategic Bitcoin
            Reserve will rely on BTC forfeited to the federal government.


            On the contrary, Hougan argues that governments typically move more slowly on such initiatives compared to corporate
            treasuries or exchange-traded funds (ETFs).


            While current steps by the US, Pakistan, and Abu Dhabi to establish crypto reserves are negligible compared to
            ETF flows and BTC treasury demand, Hougan expects more countries to join the trend before the year''s end.


            "I don''t think there will be a rush of national announcements by year-end, but I do suspect there will be a few
            more — enough to establish this as a major potential catalyst for 2026," wrote Hougan. "That realization alone
            could push prices substantially higher."


            ## **Weak dollar favors higher BTC prices**


            Another factor is the influence that a potential interest rate cut could have on Bitcoin''s price. Hougan noted
            that the top crypto has shown resilience, trading near all-time highs despite interest rates climbing to levels
            not seen since Bitcoin''s creation in 2009.


            The report highlights President Trump''s appointment of Stephen Miran, who strongly advocates for a weak dollar,
            to the Federal Reserve board, and several rate cuts before year-end, as strong price catalysts.


            "If we get much lower rates and a much weaker dollar due to money printing, Bitcoin could trade significantly
            higher," stated Hougan.


            The Bitwise CIO also expressed that the decline in Bitcoin''s volatility, especially since the launch of spot
            BTC ETFs in January 2024, has increased the chances of its allocation in institutional portfolios.


            "This is a big part of the reason why bitcoin ETF flows are accelerating (they''ve done $5.6 billion in net flows
            since July 1, which would work out to close to $50 billion in flows over a year)," the report states.


            Hougan added that this trend could accelerate in the fall due to ETFs traditionally seeing weaker flows during
            the summer.


            Lastly, the report highlights how SEC Chair Paul Atkins'' "Project Crypto" roadmap could create a potential regulated
            "ICO Market 2.0" era that could attract huge capital into the market.

            hitting a record $123,500 Wednesday, driven by institutional demand and bets on looser monetary policy.


            The cryptocurrency has gained 31% year to date and is up 60% from April’s market lows.

            Strategy ( [MSTR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSTR/)) by adding bitcoin to their balance sheets, have been
            key drivers of this year’s token rally.


            Strategists also point to the Trump administration’s pro-crypto stance as a major catalyst.


            "The administration is pushing crypto. They are pushing bitcoin. Bitcoin is the lead dog in the crypto market,"
            Tom Essaye, founder of Sevens Report Research, told Yahoo Finance earlier this week.


            "So is it short-term a little frothy? Sure," he added. "But longer term, there are some fundamental changes here
            that I think are bullish for it, and we''ll send it much higher in the future."


            Last week, President Trump [issued an executive order](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/experts-advise-caution-in-adding-private-assets-like-crypto-to-401ks-153313520.html)
            directing the Labor Department to explore allowing 401(k) plans to hold cryptocurrencies and other alternative
            assets, a move that could significantly expand retail access to crypto.


            The price surge also comes as US equities have notched all-time records on expectations the Federal Reserve will
            cut interest rates in September, and that Trump’s next Fed chair pick will likely favor looser monetary policy.


            Meanwhile, ethereum ( [ETH-USD](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/ETH-USD/)) prices [rose to near record levels](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-surges-to-near-record-as-investors-bet-on-biggest-macro-trade-of-the-next-decade-162035539.html)
            on Wednesday as Wall Street grows increasingly bullish on the world''s second-largest cryptocurrency by market
            cap.


            Ethereum''s native token, ether, jumped as much as 6% to hover above $4,700 per token, just shy of its 2021 record
            highs.


            Companies have been adding ether to their balance sheets [as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/its-not-just-bitcoin-companies-are-now-adding-ethereum-to-their-balance-sheets-180227397.html)
            behind decentralized finance and digital assets, such as stablecoins.

            This week, Bitmine Immersion Technologies ( [BMNR](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BMNR)), an ethereum treasury
            company, [announced plans](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1829311/000149315225011831/form424b5.htm) to
            sell up to another $20 billion worth of stock [to boost its holdings of the cryptocurrency](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ethereum-treasury-company-bitmine-immersion-plans-to-issue-20-billion-worth-of-stock-to-buy-more-eth-132508469.html).


            "We have stated multiple times we believe Ethereum is the biggest macro trade over the next 10-15 years," Fundstrat
            head of research Tom Lee, who also serves as chairman of Bitmine, wrote in a note Wednesday.


            Lee noted the majority of Wall Street crypto projects and stablecoins, or digital tokens backed by assets like
            the US dollar, are being built on the ethereum infrastructure.


            Story Continues


            Ether, the native token of ethereum, is up more than 50% since the GENIUS Act legislation, which creates guardrails
            for the stablecoin industry, was passed last month.


            Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission''s [recent "Project Crypto" announcement](https://cointelegraph.com/news/sec-chair-atkins-announces-project-crypto),
            an initiative to modernize the agency and establish clear regulations around the digital asset industry, has also
            fueled the rally in ethereum.


            Fundstrat sees ETH hitting prices moving as high as $15,000 by year-end.

        processed_summary: '**Crypto Market Trends & Major Developments**


          **Bitcoin (BTC):**


          *   **Record Highs:** Bitcoin has recently hit record highs, trading near **$123,500** after reaching **$124,128**.
          This surge is largely attributed to the increasing odds of an easier monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve.
          "The top crypto is up 3.6% in the past 24 hours and is trading near $123,500, following a record high of $124,128
          earlier in the trading session, according to CoinGecko data." "Bitcoin hit record highs on Wednesday with the increasing
          odds of an easier monetary policy from the U.S. Federal Reserve." Additionally, Bitcoin has gained **31% year-to-date**
          and is up **60% from April''s market lows**. "The cryptocurrency has gained 31% year to date and is up 60% from
          April’s market lows."

          *   **Institutional Demand & Regulatory Environment:** Inflows into spot exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and purchases
          by public companies adding Bitcoin to their balance sheets have been key drivers. "Inflows into spot exchange-traded
          funds, along with purchases from public companies copying the blueprint of software firm-turned-bitcoin juggernaut
          Strategy (MSTR) by adding bitcoin to their balance sheets, have been key drivers of this year’s token rally." The
          Trump administration''s pro-crypto stance is also a significant catalyst. "Strategists also point to the Trump administration’s
          pro-crypto stance as a major catalyst."

          *   **Potential for Further Upside:** Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan suggests four untapped developments could trigger
          further price growth: government demand for crypto as reserve assets, a weak US Dollar, low volatility, and the
          potential rebirth of a regulated ICO market. "The crypto market could witness a strong uptrend in the coming months
          from four key price catalysts, including government demand, a weak US Dollar, low volatility, and potential rebirth
          of the ICO market, according to Bitwise CIO Matt Hougan in a report on Wednesday."

          *   **Government Bitcoin Purchases:** While a previous statement indicated the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve would
          rely on forfeited BTC, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent later tweeted, suggesting direct government Bitcoin purchases
          remain a possibility. "US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who stated in an interview with FOX Business on Thursday
          that the government won''t be purchasing Bitcoin directly. He said the US Strategic Bitcoin Reserve will rely on
          BTC forfeited to the federal government." However, "The Treasury Secretary''s late-Thursday afternoon tweet seemingly
          contradicted his statement from earlier in the day."

          *   **Declining Volatility:** The decline in Bitcoin''s volatility since the launch of spot BTC ETFs in January
          2024 has increased its chances of allocation in institutional portfolios. "The Bitwise CIO also expressed that the
          decline in Bitcoin''s volatility, especially since the launch of spot BTC ETFs in January 2024, has increased the
          chances of its allocation in institutional portfolios."


          **Ethereum (ETH):**


          *   **Near Record Levels & Strong Inflows:** Ethereum prices have risen to near record levels, with its native token,
          ether, jumping as much as **6% to hover above $4,700**, just shy of its 2021 record highs. "Meanwhile, ethereum
          (ETH-USD) prices rose to near record levels on Wednesday as Wall Street grows increasingly bullish on the world''s
          second-largest cryptocurrency by market cap." "Ethereum''s native token, ether, jumped as much as 6% to hover above
          $4,700 per token, just shy of its 2021 record highs." Institutional investors are flooding into Ethereum funds at
          nearly triple the rate of Bitcoin, with **$704 million in inflows** on Wednesday compared to Bitcoin ETFs'' $86.7
          million. "Institutional investors are flooding into Ethereum funds at nearly triple the rate of Bitcoin, providing
          a glimpse at how Wall Street may be positioning this year for the second-largest crypto." "Ethereum exchange-traded
          funds clocked $704 million in inflows on Wednesday compared to Bitcoin ETFs'' $86.7 million, the third consecutive
          day of Ethereum’s dominance over the alpha coin, according to Farside Investors data."

          *   **Regulatory Clarity & Institutional Adoption:** Ethereum is benefiting from regulatory developments, including
          the GENIUS Act and SEC Chair Paul Atkins'' "Project Crypto" speech supporting DeFi growth for institutions. "Institutional
          investors are flooding into Ethereum funds at nearly triple the rate of Bitcoin, providing a glimpse at how Wall
          Street may be positioning this year for the second-largest crypto." "The momentum has propelled Ethereum to $4,775,
          up over 60% in the past month, according to CoinGecko, and within 4% of its November 2021 all-time high near $4,900."
          "Ether, the native token of ethereum, is up more than 50% since the GENIUS Act legislation, which creates guardrails
          for the stablecoin industry, was passed last month." "Additionally, the Securities and Exchange Commission''s recent
          "Project Crypto" announcement, an initiative to modernize the agency and establish clear regulations around the
          digital asset industry, has also fueled the rally in ethereum."

          *   **Price Targets and Supply-Demand Imbalance:** Standard Chartered revised its Ethereum price targets to **$7,500
          by 2025 and $25,000 by 2028**, citing institutional buying at "nearly double the pace of Bitcoin accumulation during
          peak periods." "On Wednesday, Standard Chartered revised its Ethereum price targets to $7,500 by 2025 and $25,000
          by 2028, up from a previous $4,000 forecast, citing institutional buying at "nearly double the pace of Bitcoin accumulation
          during peak periods."" Monthly Ethereum ETF inflows have reached **$2.3 billion**, equivalent to 500,000 ETH, while
          the network has issued only 450,000 ETH since the September 2022 merge upgrade, creating an upward price pressure.
          "Monthly Ethereum ETF inflows have reached $2.3 billion, equivalent to 500,000 ETH, while the network has issued
          only 450,000 ETH since the September 2022 merge upgrade." "The supply-demand imbalance has created upward price
          pressure as institutional buyers absorb available supply faster than the network creates new tokens."

          *   **Corporate Balance Sheet Additions:** Companies are adding ether to their balance sheets to gain exposure to
          the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets. "Companies have been adding ether to their
          balance sheets as a way to gain exposure to the tech infrastructure behind decentralized finance and digital assets,
          such as stablecoins." Bitmine Immersion Technologies, an Ethereum treasury company, plans to sell up to another
          **$20 billion worth of stock** to boost its ETH holdings. "This week, Bitmine Immersion Technologies (BMNR), an
          ethereum treasury company, announced plans to sell up to another $20 billion worth of stock to boost its holdings
          of the cryptocurrency."


          **XRP:**


          *   **Regulatory Clarity & Price Ascent:** Increased "regulatory clarity from the SEC v. Ripple case resolution"
          is cited as one of the reasons for XRP''s recent ascent. "Increased “regulatory clarity from the SEC v. Ripple case
          resolution,” Ryan Lee, chief analyst at Bitget research, told Decrypt, is one of the reasons for XRP’s recent ascent."

          *   **Price Targets & Long-Term Adoption:** The upper limit of the target for 2025 is **$5.81**, with expectations
          for widespread adoption in the long run to push XRP''s price to nearly **$9 by the end of 2026**. "The upper limit
          of his target for 2025 is $5.81, but he expects widespread adoption in the long run to push the XRP’s price to nearly
          $9 by the end of 2026."

          *   **Real World Asset Tokenization:** Ripple Senior Vice President Markus Infanger explains that the XRP Ledger
          is "uniquely suited" for real-world asset tokenization. "Ripple Exec on Why XRP Ledger Is ‘Uniquely Suited’ for
          Real World Asset Tokenization" [https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/08/14/ripple-exec-on-why-xrp-ledger-is-uniquely-suited-for-real-world-asset-tokenization](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2025/08/14/ripple-exec-on-why-xrp-ledger-is-uniquely-suited-for-real-world-asset-tokenization)

          **General Crypto Market Trends:**


          *   **"Exceptionally Strong" Conditions:** The overall crypto market conditions are described as "exceptionally
          strong." "So far, conditions look exceptionally strong,” Lawant added."

          *   **Influence of Federal Reserve Policy:** The increasing odds of an easier monetary policy from the U.S. Federal
          Reserve, specifically the potential for September rate cuts soaring above 90%, are encouraging borrowing and stimulating
          spending, which tends to benefit the crypto market. "With the odds of a September rate cut soaring above 90%, a
          lower interest rate would encourage borrowing and stimulate spending. The stock market and crypto tend to rise in
          such environments, as investors seek higher yields from risk assets."

          *   **Risk-On Environment:** Bitcoin is joining global stocks in scaling record peaks, indicating a "risk-on" market
          sentiment. "You know markets are fully risk-on when cryptocurrencies are on a tear, with bitcoin joining global
          stocks to scale a record peak as the near certainty of U.S. interest rate cuts bolsters risk sentiment and weighs
          on the dollar."

          *   **Caution Regarding Rate Cut Assumptions:** Some analysts caution that the market might be "priced for perfection"
          regarding the assumption of Fed rate cuts, especially with core CPI ticking up slightly and unknown impacts of tariffs.
          "Still, the "clear danger" is the market''s assumption that the Fed will cut rates next month, Hundal cautioned."

          *   **Regulatory Climate:** A crypto-friendly regulatory climate in Washington under the Trump administration is
          contributing to renewed buying pressure and confidence. "Renewed buying pressure and confidence can also be attributed
          to the crypto-friendly regulatory climate in Washington under U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration."

          *   **Leverage Flush:** A recent **$1 billion leverage flush** in the crypto market is seen by analysts as a "healthy
          pullback" despite a slide in crypto prices after a troubling U.S. PPI report. "Crypto Slide Spurs $1B Leverage Flush,
          But It''s a Healthy Pullback, Analysts Say" [https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/14/crypto-slide-spurs-usd1b-leverage-flush-but-it-s-a-healthy-pullback-analysts-say](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/14/crypto-slide-spurs-usd1b-leverage-flush-but-it-s-a-healthy-pullback-analysts-say)
          2025-08-14T12:06:00Z "Crypto Prices Quickly Slide After Troubling U.S. PPI Report" [https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/14/crypto-prices-quickly-slide-after-troubling-u-s-ppi-report](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/08/14/crypto-prices-quickly-slide-after-troubling-u-s-ppi-report)
          2025-08-14T11:00:00Z

          *   **Potential for "ICO Market 2.0":** SEC Chair Paul Atkins'' "Project Crypto" roadmap could lead to a regulated
          "ICO Market 2.0" era, attracting significant capital. "Lastly, the report highlights how SEC Chair Paul Atkins''
          "Project Crypto" roadmap could create a potential regulated "ICO Market 2.0" era that could attract huge capital
          into the market."

          *   **Stablecoin Developments:** Wall Street and consumer advocates are calling for edits to the GENIUS Act on stablecoins,
          even before regulators begin writing rules. "Wall Street Joins Consumer Advocates to Call for Edit to GENIUS Act
          on Stablecoins" [https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/14/wall-street-joins-consumer-advocates-to-call-for-edit-to-genius-act-on-stablecoins](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/14/wall-street-joins-consumer-advocates-to-call-for-edit-to-genius-act-on-stablecoins)
          2025-08-14T16:34:00Z

          *   **US Blacklisting:** The U.S. has blacklisted a crypto network behind a Ruble-backed stablecoin and a shuttered
          exchange, accusing them of money laundering and sanctions evasion. "U.S. Blacklists Crypto Network Behind Ruble-Backed
          Stablecoin and Shuttered Exchange Garantex" [https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/14/ofac-sanctions-crypto-network-behind-ruble-backed-stablecoin-and-shuttered-exchange-garantex](https://www.coindesk.com/policy/2025/08/14/ofac-sanctions-crypto-network-behind-ruble-backed-stablecoin-and-shuttered-exchange-garantex)

  output:
    response: 'Here''s a summary of the latest developments in Layer 2 scaling solutions, specifically focusing on Polygon,
      Arbitrum, and Optimism:


      **Arbitrum:**

      *   **Market Growth and Ecosystem Expansion:** Arbitrum''s ARB token recently experienced a **16.8% increase to $0.552**,

      Aug 13, 2025 10:35 pm ET).

      *   **DeFi Ecosystem Strengthening:** Arbitrum is strengthening its DeFi ecosystem with the **launch of Treehouse’s
      fixed-income protocol**, which introduces tokenized yield assets like tETH and tAVAX, along with the new Decentralized
      Offered Rate benchmark. This aims to provide more predictable returns for institutional investors and has contributed
      to a **$500 million total value locked (TVL) growth since late 2024**. "Arbitrum continues to strengthen its DeFi ecosystem
      with the launch of Treehouse’s fixed-income protocol, introducing tokenized yield assets like tETH and tAVAX alongside

      monitoring continuation." (blockchain.news, 8/14/2025 7:43:00 AM).

      *   **Resilience Despite Token Unlock:** Despite a recent $38 million token unlock, which could have led to selling
      pressure, **ARB prices climbed 10% in a single day**, indicating strong demand. "Despite a recent $38 million token
      unlock – which could have sparked sell pressure – ARB prices climbed 10% in a single day, signaling strong demand."

      **General Layer 2 Developments:**

      *   **Increased Interest and Institutional Demand:** Ethereum Layer 2 tokens are experiencing significant growth, driven
      by the recent surge in Ethereum''s price and **growing institutional interest**. "Ethereum Layer 2 tokens have surged
      today, with ARB increasing by 16.8% to $0.552, ZK rising by 16.9% to $0.069, MNT surging by 9.1% to $1.12, and OP going
      up by 9% to $0.8472. The general rise in these tokens reflects the growing interest in Ethereum Layer 2 solutions."
      (ainvest.com, Wednesday, Aug 13, 2025 10:35 pm ET). "Second, growing institutional interest in Ethereum scaling projects
      is another key driver. Analysts note that Layer 2 adoption often correlates with sustained ETH price strength." (ainvest.com,
      Wednesday, Aug 13, 2025 10:35 pm ET).

      *   **Competition with Polygon:** Arbitrum, Injective (not directly queried but mentioned as a competitor), and Optimism
      are emerging as strong contenders to challenge Polygon''s dominance as Layer 2 adoption shows signs of slowing. "Arbitrum,
      Injective, and Optimism challenge Polygon as Layer-2 adoption slows, showing resilient market growth despite price declines."

            \n(OP) are emerging as strong contenders to outshine Polygon (POL) as adoption of Layer-2 solutions appears to\
            \ slow. While all three projects have faced price declines, their market capitalization growth, ecosystem development,\
            \ and unique positioning suggest they could maintain or even strengthen their roles in the\n\n[Ethereum](https://crypto.ainvest.com/ETHUSD/?exchange=CRYPTO)\n\
            \n[ETH\\\\\n--](https://www.ainvest.com/chart?symbol=CRYPTO-ETHUSD)\n\nscaling landscape.\n\nArbitrum has seen\
            \ a 73.77% drop from its previous highs, trading at $0.4712. However, its market cap increased by 8.68% in the\
            \ last 24 hours to $2.42 billion, with a circulating supply of 5.15 billion ARB out of a total of 10 billion.\
            \ Daily trading volume reached $344.6 million, a 14.02% decline compared to the prior day, with a volume-to-market-cap\
            \ ratio of 14.19%. Despite the volatility, Arbitrum continues to expand its ecosystem and maintain strong developer\
            \ activity, reinforcing its position as a key player in the Layer-2 market \\[1\\].\n\nInjective (INJ) has recorded\
            \ an impressive all-time gain of 1307.48%, currently trading at $14.70. Its market cap increased by 3.56% to $1.47\
            \ billion, with nearly all tokens in circulation—99.97 million out of a total 100 million. Daily trading volume\
            \ stood at $1.09 billion, with a volume-to-market-cap ratio of 7.41%. Injective’s low inflation risk and robust\
            \ decentralized finance (DeFi) capabilities position it as a sustainable alternative in the Layer-2 space. Its\
            \ strong historical performance and growing interest in its derivatives and exchange features further enhance\
            \ its appeal \\[1\\].\n\nAsk Aime: Which Layer-2 solution will top out and unveil a stronger market position?\n\
            \nOptimism (OP) trades at $0.8096, down 82.28% from its peak. Despite this, its market cap rose by 6.26% to $1.41\
            \ billion in the past day. The circulating supply is 1.75 billion\n\n[OP](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-OP/)\n\
            \n[OP\\\\\n--](https://www.ainvest.com/stocks/NASDAQ-OP/)\n\nout of a total of 4.29 billion, with an unlocked\
            \ market cap of $1.72 billion. Daily trading volume reached $267.7 million, and the volume-to-market-cap ratio\
            \ stands at 18.92%. Although its price has weakened, Optimism continues to work on technical improvements and\
            \ strategic partnerships within the Ethereum scaling ecosystem. These efforts support its ongoing relevance as\
            \ a viable Layer-2 option \\[1\\].\n\nAs adoption of Layer-2 solutions shows signs of slowing, the continued growth\
            \ in market metrics and active development for Arbitrum, Injective, and Optimism suggests they could challenge\
            \ Polygon’s dominance. Their distinct advantages—be it ecosystem expansion, low inflation, or technical progress—position\
            \ them well to attract attention and investment. While price corrections are common in the crypto market, the\
            \ underlying fundamentals and strategic moves by these projects indicate they remain strong players in the evolving\

            \nAinvestWednesday, Aug 13, 2025 10:35 pm ET\n\n![](https://cdn.ainvest.com/frontResources/s/ainvest-nova/news/_next/static/media/timeIcon.98770249.png)2min\
            \ read\n\n[ETH\\\\\n-0.07%](https://www.ainvest.com/chart?symbol=CRYPTO-ETHUSD)\n\n[OP\\\\\n-0.29%](https://www.ainvest.com/chart?symbol=CRYPTO-OPUSD)\n\
            \n[ZRX\\\\\n-0.33%](https://www.ainvest.com/chart?symbol=CRYPTO-ZRXUSD)\n\nEthereum Layer 2 tokens have surged\
            \ today, with ARB increasing by 16.8% to $0.552, ZK rising by 16.9% to $0.069, MNT surging by 9.1% to $1.12, and\
            \ OP going up by 9% to $0.8472. The general rise in these tokens reflects the growing interest in Ethereum Layer\
            \ 2 solutions.\n\nEthereum Layer 2 tokens have seen significant gains today, reflecting a broader trend of increased\
            \ interest in Layer 2 solutions. ARB (Arbitrum) rose by 16.8% to $0.552, ZK (zkSync) by 16.9% to $0.069, MNT (Mantle)\
            \ surged by 9.1% to $1.12, and OP (Optimism) climbed by 9% to $0.8472 \\[1\\].\n\nThe surge in Ethereum Layer\
            \ 2 tokens is driven by several factors. First, the recent price surge of Ethereum (ETH) above $4,200 has boosted\
            \ demand for Layer 2 solutions, as traders seek exposure to the next wave of returns within the Ethereum ecosystem\
            \ \\[1\\]. Layer 2 platforms offer faster and cheaper transactions, making them increasingly attractive to users\
            \ and developers.\n\nSecond, growing institutional interest in Ethereum scaling projects is another key driver.\
            \ Analysts note that Layer 2 adoption often correlates with sustained ETH price strength \\[1\\]. As Ethereum\
            \ continues to upgrade and expand its Layer 2 solutions, institutional traders are beginning to take notice of\
            \ scaling plays.\n\nThird, the emergence of promising projects like MAGACOIN FINANCE is drawing attention. Positioning\
            \ itself as a high-growth opportunity, MAGACOIN is being compared to early-stage projects like Polygon. The project\
            \ claims to be backed by a Hashex audit, capped supply, and expanding DeFi integrations, making it a notable contender\
            \ in the presale space \\[1\\].\n\nThe current rally in Layer 2 tokens reflects the shifting dynamics in the crypto\
            \ market, where Ethereum’s strength is amplifying interest in its ecosystem. As Optimism and zkSync continue to\
            \ gain traction, institutional traders are beginning to take notice of scaling plays. Early-stage projects like\
            \ MAGACOIN are also attracting attention as potential next-gen opportunities.\n\nInstitutional demand for ETH\
            \ has been the key force behind ERC20 and other token adoption \\[2\\]. Technical indicators such as growing total\
            \ value locked (TVL), climbing staking participation, and heightened Ethereum price prediction sentiment suggest\
            \ that ETH is poised for further gains. These conditions create a fertile environment for tokens on the Ethereum\
            \ mainnet, with two tokens—$LBRETT and MOG—emerging as the most likely to capitalize on this momentum.\n\n$LBRETT\
            \ and MOG are forecasted by analysts to have the potential to surge as much as 50x, riding the wave of institutional\
            \ and retail participation. Both tokens are being closely monitored by traders and analysts as probable leaders\
            \ in the next phase of Ethereum-driven growth \\[2\\].\n\nAs investors seek the next major opportunity in the\
            \ Ethereum landscape, projects like $LBRETT and MAGACOIN FINANCE emerge as standout contenders. With robust fundamentals,\
            \ rising adoption, and big technical milestones, these tokens are poised for significant growth.\n\nReferences:\n\

            ## These 3 Layer-2 Cryptos Could Outshine Polygon (POL) as Adoption Slows


            2025-08-10


            ![](https://i0.wp.com/cryptonewsland.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/dca.jpg?resize=800%2C492&ssl=1)


            - Arbitrum Holds Ground—Despite a 73.77% drop, Arbitrum’s market cap growth and ecosystem expansion sustain its
            position in the Layer-2 race.


            - Injective Shows Exceptional Gains – A 1307% all-time rise and near-full token release make Injective a low-inflation
            contender with lasting momentum.


            - Optimism Remains in Play—Price weakness contrasts with strong technical progress, keeping Optimism relevant
            as Polygon (POL) adoption slows.


            Arbitrum, Injective, and Optimism are showing notable movements in market metrics, suggesting they could outshine
            Polygon(POL) as adoption slows. Each project holds distinct strengths and market positions, while recent price
            action highlights resilience despite overall declines in the broader [crypto](https://cryptonewsland.com/best-crypto-to-buy-now-aurealone-next-gen-play-to-earn-token-with-1000x-upside-tron-powers-scalable-low-fee-transactions/)
            sector. Their circulating supplies, market cap changes, and liquidity levels indicate active engagement and potential
            for renewed momentum.


            ## **Arbitrum Shows Volatility but Retains Market Strength**


            [Arbitrum (ARB)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/arbitrum/) trades at $0.4712, reflecting a steep 73.77%
            decline from previous highs. However, its market cap increased 8.68% in the last 24 hours, reaching $2.42 billion.
            The circulating supply stands at 5.15 billion ARB from a total of 10 billion, with no fixed maximum supply.


            ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeVWXesUSAzu7d6nKYg6tTStAscwhRdWCBXMdmBuQiGMFdtekwS_-_X9XzadqzZp6-NN2OvKwgRM6xMrznzuaAzC99XVT5Aev5cOk6YP5ODt2XF0bfPJ-GRzbojmIgD_gl5axYR0w?key=xyJsJxjBbKGuSmPl4UFjAw)


            Trading volume reached $344.6 million, marking a 14.02% daily drop, and the volume-to-market-cap ratio stands
            at 14.19%. This ratio shows moderate liquidity activity compared to its total valuation, keeping it relevant in
            Layer-2 competition. Historical charts reveal peaks in mid-2024 and early 2025, followed by sharp declines that
            reflect speculative cycles.


            Despite recent losses, Arbitrum maintains a strong Layer-2 presence and continues expanding its ecosystem. This
            positioning keeps it in the conversation when comparing rivals that could outshine Polygon (POL) as adoption slows.
            Sustained developer activity and growing integrations reinforce its competitive role in Ethereum scaling solutions.


            ## **Injective Maintains High Returns Despite Corrections**


            [Injective (INJ)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/injective/) currently trades at $14.70, holding a 1307.48%
            all-time gain since launch. Its market cap rose 3.56% in the past day to $1.47 billion. Circulating supply is
            nearly fully released, with 99.97 million INJ of a 100 million total.


            ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfHTWq5baHqu_A7LUZcGMa-uTfaB23R-gpTmugJsr8kCRNaFhnpjpA-AoiPnO7XR3y8H6uY4T9oyQCSD3HweTNpeDFW4TBtR2LQ4RHvziibIxT1TOy-kBVPZC3AZhND-m21aAOy6Q?key=xyJsJxjBbKGuSmPl4UFjAw)


            The daily trading volume is 1.09 billion, and the ratio between volume to market capitalization is 7.41 percent
            with a 24-hour decrease of 29.45 percent. The past statistics indicate significant rallies during the end of 2023,
            where the prices were above the $40 mark after corrections set a new base point of trading. These trends indicate
            high involvement of the community and interest in its local decentralized finance system.


            With limited inflation risk and strong historical growth, Injective remains a standout Layer-2 alternative. It
            continues attracting use cases that could push adoption higher and potentially outshine Polygon (POL) as adoption
            slows. The network’s decentralized derivatives and exchange capabilities add to its growth potential.


            ## **Optimism Struggles After Peak but Remains Active**


            [Optimism (OP)](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/optimism-ethereum/) trades at $0.8096, down 82.28% from its
            highs, yet its market cap rose 6.26% in the past day to $1.41 billion. The circulating supply is 1.75 billion
            OP of a 4.29 billion total and maximum supply. Unlocked market cap now sits at $1.72 billion.


            ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXeKwgnyJQwzQeKdqxJt9ih7r-rTJ1CSftdOOzSwmPV4yDC3hE-_s49Mdiq71f12dGCe20J-2BwBJhiuOViUXnCwvR7AeR31bPr--3XN03tIruylJWkrStjZoG15d-JShk6g6YIyAA?key=xyJsJxjBbKGuSmPl4UFjAw)


            It trades at a 23.81 percent decrease with a daily trading volume of $267.7 million, but the rate of the volume
            to the market capitalization of 18.92 percent indicates trading of the tokens. According to the charts, there
            will be a massive rise to over 4 in the early beginning of 2024 and a decline over the longer term of the year
            2025. This trajectory suggests weakened sentiment but ongoing market participation.


            Optimism still advances technical upgrades and partnerships within Ethereum scaling. These developments keep it
            in the list of projects that could outshine Polygon (POL) as adoption slows. Its sustained trading activity and
            ecosystem growth maintain its relevance despite price declines.

            # Top 3 Layer-2 Cryptos That Can Change the Future of Finance


            SourceCryptopolitan


            Ethereum’s early investors saw gains of over 14,000%, proving that projects solving real scalability problems
            can deliver life-changing returns. Now, a new generation of Layer-2 solutions is stepping up to push blockchain
            adoption further – and some analysts believe MAGACOIN FINANCE could follow a similar path for early backers. With
            strong fundamentals, rising adoption, and big technical milestones, Mantle, Polygon, and Arbitrum are three L2s
            worth watching closely.


            **Mantle: Banking Meets DeFi**


            Mantle is taking a bold step by launching UR, a crypto-native banking app designed to merge traditional and decentralized
            finance. Users can manage both fiat and crypto accounts, receive virtual cards, and even set up automated investments
            into Mantle’s $400 million MI4 tokenized fund. This could make DeFi more accessible to everyday users, especially
            with planned features like salary tokenization and seamless cross-border payments.


            ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXec_30d-i3xXe-HbvH7uBL4fOuItffZLkdfjy2K5nhXxCSSEq3lBY4zXdpB62eke8aVwhZi3DeMAXAsojN06RRPqp_8l8P1SDwUCdjKwFIOqiImGzPzr1DN4XWcDFFpn7NypefbxQ?key=Sy--Yf12I1gRl2lPcuW46g)


            In addition, Mantle became the first Ethereum L2 to partner with EigenLayer, integrating EigenDA for secure data
            availability. More than 108,000 mETH – valued at roughly $388 million – has been restaked to support this upgrade,
            boosting scalability and cementing Mantle’s role in Ethereum’s growing restaking trend.


            **Polygon: Speed and Scale in Action**


            Polygon’s Bhilai upgrade has significantly improved network performance, now handling around 1,000 transactions
            per second with a finality time of just 5 seconds. The upcoming AggLayer v3.0 aims to increase capacity to 5,000
            TPS by October, powered by zero-knowledge tech for seamless cross-chain operations.


            ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfjuh0E-hh2nWu7S4m0Wws8dX4oM_iDjaNe9DMXqhigTvhcdCOkXenqUJvTjXDkgBeA1aMoELXUjR6g5oOlrdo9YwqwcsVVkWgP4JFnkwGMd020vO3m-8Xc0aQm07yHKQ-Dm2Fcvw?key=Sy--Yf12I1gRl2lPcuW46g)


            The stablecoin supply on Polygon has grown by 8.2% to $2.1 billion since May, showing strong traction in payments
            and real-world asset tokenization. While the project continues to expand its ecosystem and technical capabilities,
            the market still hasn’t fully priced in its potential – something long-term investors may see as an opportunity.


            **A New Potential 14,000% Play?**


            Just like Ethereum rewarded its earliest believers, MAGACOIN FINANCE is attracting attention as a great opportunity
            for early investors with experts forecasting a **major breakout.**. The project’s presale stages have been selling
            out quickly, with a growing community eager to secure positions before a major exchange listing. Analysts point
            to its ambitious roadmap and expanding utility as reasons it could deliver returns on par with past crypto giants.
            For those looking for early exposure to the next crypto star, MAGACOIN FINANCE is firmly on the radar.


            ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfhyJQ-uRmQdAFUgmvt_Xmtg6MVIsSrnQFQa_AFnd-4izfFds6OIaaAcLmY8UFqYZwI-VYlNwM2ElmYMr_XZNjfKjMLzehKUAQ7PGjYdNZmb7LnyTEgRtvzYztnh_30nDQTcaGb?key=Sy--Yf12I1gRl2lPcuW46g)


            **Arbitrum: DeFi Depth and Market Resilience**


            Arbitrum continues to strengthen its DeFi ecosystem with the launch of Treehouse’s fixed-income protocol, introducing
            tokenized yield assets like tETH and tAVAX alongside the new Decentralized Offered Rate benchmark. This move caters
            to institutional investors by offering more predictable returns, adding to the $500 million total value locked
            growth since late 2024.


            ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfj5wGOSnnvbiO7cugBZk-ByKceUH20CGCUYgzQRp59Jf1lOXsLNmV4O97dwC0NKdxiUvh2kJ8MX5Sz9Mlecdr_qgU_u0nowBOrNWHmGcGas8Bj5C1aGB7OTP2ugh_W07DuASLvlg?key=Sy--Yf12I1gRl2lPcuW46g)


            Despite a recent $38 million token unlock – which could have sparked sell pressure – ARB prices climbed 10% in
            a single day, signaling strong demand. With clearer regulatory frameworks for stablecoins under the GENIUS Act,
            Arbitrum’s lending and borrowing markets could see even more institutional adoption.


            **Conclusion**


            Layer-2 solutions are proving to be a key driver in blockchain’s next phase of growth. Mantle is bridging traditional
            and decentralized finance, Polygon is scaling at record speed, and Arbitrum is building a deeper DeFi toolkit.
            For investors aiming to capture early-stage potential, MAGACOIN FINANCE offers an interesting **opportunity**
            that could mirror Ethereum’s **historic rise**– making it one to watch closely in the months ahead.

            ### Analysis


            Arbitrum''s ARB token has finally broken out of its prolonged consolidation phase, signaling potential for a fresh
            uptrend in the cryptocurrency market. According to trader Michaël van de Poppe, after six months of range-bound
            trading, ARB has surged past key resistance levels, setting the stage for higher price targets. This development
            comes at a time when layer-2 scaling solutions like Arbitrum are gaining renewed attention amid improving Ethereum
            network conditions and broader crypto market recovery efforts. Traders are now eyeing the next resistance zones
            at $0.95-1.00 and $1.15-1.20, which could represent significant profit-taking opportunities or entry points for
            long positions.


            ## Breaking Down the ARB Breakout and Trading Implications


            The breakout from the six-month consolidation range is a classic technical pattern in cryptocurrency trading,
            often preceding strong directional moves. As noted in the analysis shared on August 14, 2025, ARB''s price action
            has confirmed an upward breach, backed by increasing trading volumes that suggest growing buyer interest. For
            context, during the consolidation period, ARB traded within a tight band, oscillating between support around $0.50
            and resistance near $0.80, based on historical chart data. This breakout could be fueled by positive developments
            in the Arbitrum ecosystem, such as rising decentralized finance activity and potential upgrades to enhance transaction
            speeds. From a trading perspective, this move invalidates previous bearish theses and opens the door for momentum
            traders to capitalize on the uptrend. Key indicators like the Relative Strength Index (RSI) might show overbought
            conditions soon, but with the breakout''s momentum, dips could serve as buying opportunities. Traders should monitor
            on-chain metrics, including daily active addresses on the Arbitrum network, which have reportedly increased by
            15% in recent weeks, indicating real user adoption driving the price surge.


            ### Target Zones and Risk Management Strategies for ARB Traders


            Focusing on the projected target zones, the first area at $0.95-1.00 represents a 20-25% upside from recent breakout
            levels, making it an attractive short-term goal for swing traders. Beyond that, the $1.15-1.20 zone aligns with
            previous all-time highs from earlier market cycles, potentially acting as a psychological barrier. To trade this
            effectively, consider multiple pairs such as ARB/USDT on major exchanges, where 24-hour trading volumes have spiked
            to over $200 million in recent sessions, providing ample liquidity. Risk management is crucial; setting stop-loss
            orders below the breakout level, around $0.70, can protect against false breakouts or sudden reversals. Additionally,
            correlating this with Bitcoin''s performance—since ARB often moves in tandem with BTC—traders might look for BTC
            holding above $60,000 as a bullish confirmation. Institutional flows into layer-2 tokens have also been notable,
            with reports of increased whale accumulations, adding fundamental support to the technical breakout.


            In the broader market context, this ARB uptrend could influence related cryptocurrencies, such as Optimism''s
            OP or Polygon’s MATIC, as competition heats up in the scaling solutions space. For stock market correlations,
            events like rising tech stock indices (e.g., Nasdaq) often boost crypto sentiment, potentially amplifying ARB''s
            gains if AI-driven blockchain integrations gain traction. Traders interested in cross-market opportunities might
            explore ARB''s ties to AI tokens, given Arbitrum''s potential for hosting AI-powered dApps. Overall, this breakout
            underscores a shift in market sentiment, with potential for ARB to test higher resistances if volume sustains.
            As always, combining technical analysis with on-chain data will be key to navigating this evolving trend, offering
            savvy traders a chance to position ahead of the crowd.


            To optimize trading strategies, consider timeframe-specific approaches: on the daily chart, the breakout candle
            from August 14, 2025, shows a decisive close above resistance, while hourly charts reveal intraday support at
            $0.85. Market indicators like moving averages are aligning bullishly, with the 50-day MA crossing above the 200-day
            MA, forming a golden cross pattern. This could propel ARB toward the upper targets, but watch for volatility spikes,
            as implied by rising Bollinger Band widths. For those trading derivatives, options volumes on ARB have increased,
            suggesting hedged bets on further upside. In summary, this development positions ARB as a high-conviction play
            in the current crypto landscape, with clear entry and exit levels for disciplined traders aiming to ride the uptrend
            wave.

            With the rise of data being used to train the Machine, the need for Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) like
            ZK Proofs is the need of the hour. But WTF is **ZERO KNOWLEDGE PROOF**?


            We live in a world where information is power — and yet, paradoxically, the more we share, the more vulnerable
            we become.


            Our systems are built on trust, but that trust too often requires exposure.


            We’ve already seen what happens when data is overexposed. The 2019 Netflix documentary [The Great Hack](https://share.google/VjrNW3Gb38Sy6NsE1)
            uncovered how Cambridge Analytica harvested the personal data of millions of Facebook users and it was used to
            manipulate the public opinion in Trump elections


            To prove who we are, we show everything.


            To prove compliance, we hand over logs.


            To prove we’re telling the truth, we reveal what should have remained private.


            This has never felt quite right.


            Zero-knowledge proofs offer a new path.


            One where trust does not require disclosure.


            One where you can prove something is true — without revealing why or how you know it.


            It sounds like a trick. But it isn’t.


            It’s pure math.


            > A Brief History of ZK Proofs


            The concept of zero-knowledge proofs was first introduced in the 1980s by researchers Goldwasser, Micali, and
            Rackoff. It started as a theoretical breakthrough — a way to prove knowledge of a secret without revealing the
            secret itself. For years, it stayed mostly within academia. Too complex. Too slow. Too “mathy” to be real.

            > The Classic Analogy


            There’s a thought experiment often used to explain it.


            Imagine someone holding two balls — one red, one green — but you’re color-blind and can’t tell them apart.


            They claim the balls are different, but how do you know?


            You ask them to hide the balls behind their back, maybe switch them, maybe not, and then show them again.


            You repeat this over and over.


            If they can always tell you correctly whether a switch happened, you build confidence they know something — without
            ever needing to see the color yourself.


            This is a **zero-knowledge proof**.


            You gain trust, but learn nothing else.


            The math is mathing — with every round, the probability they’re bluffing keep decreasing.


            > Types of ZK Proofs


            As ZK moved from idea to implementation, two species of proof emerged:


            **ZK-SNARKs** (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge): compact, fast, efficient — but require a trusted
            setup. Used in projects like [**Zcash**](https://z.cash/) and early rollups.


            **ZK-STARKs** (Scalable Transparent ARgument of Knowledge): no trusted setup, but bigger proofs and more overhead.
            Think of them as SNARKs with more transparency and more math.


            Both SNARKs and STARKs rely on transforming logic into **arithmetic circuits** — systems of gates that model computation
            like a giant Lego of math. These circuits let the prover demonstrate they did a valid computation, without showing
            the inputs.


            > ZK-Rollups: Scaling Without Sacrificing Trust


            Blockchains are slow and expensive — and ZK-rollups are how we fix that.


            A **ZK-rollup** bundles thousands of transactions off-chain, computes a validity proof, and publishes a single
            succinct proof back to the main chain.


            It’s like compressing the whole week’s worth of Ethereum traffic into a single “yes, this was all valid” statement.


            Projects like **StarkNet**, **zkSync**, and **Polygon Zero** are using this to scale Ethereum without sacrificing
            decentralization.

            Every transaction gets verified, but no one sees your inputs, or even needs to replay them.Because what’s submitted
            to the chain is not the data itself — but a cryptographic proof that the transaction was valid according to the
            rules. It’s like showing a correct answer without revealing your steps — because the math guarantees the steps
            were valid.


            Privacy + scalability. That’s the magic.


            > Real-World Privacy: Zcash and Tornado Cash


            Take **Zcash**, a privacy coin based on zk-SNARKs. It lets users send shielded transactions — the amounts, addresses,
            and memo fields are hidden from public view.


            But the proof? Valid. The transaction? Legit.


            This was a revolution. But it came with controversy.


            Then came **Tornado Cash**, an Ethereum mixer using ZK to enable anonymous ETH transactions. It allowed users
            to break linkability between wallets — a noble goal for privacy, but one that also attracted illicit use.


            In 2022, Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. Treasury. A smart contract. Sanctioned. It marked a turning point:
            **privacy is no longer a tech-only issue. It’s geopolitical.**


            But the tech didn’t flinch.


            ZK remains legal. And powerful.


            > The Math Behind the Magic: Commitments and Circuits


            At the heart of ZK is a simple idea: **prove knowledge without revealing the secret**.


            **Pedersen commitment** — you commit to a value without revealing it, like sealing it in a box. Later, you can
            prove things about it (like its size, relation to others) without ever opening the box.


            The rest is built on **arithmetic circuits** — imagine translating your logic or smart contract into math equations.
            Provers run the logic, and generate a proof that they followed the rules. Verifiers can check this instantly —
            with no idea what the input was.


            It’s math as truth. No subjectivity. No need for trust.

            > Real-Life Applications


            What if you could qualify for a loan without revealing your financial history? No income, no employer, no salary.
            Just a proof:


            **“Yes, I meet the requirements.”**


            This is already happening.


            Dutch bank **ING** created a zero-knowledge system to verify income thresholds without exposing raw data. The
            bank learns nothing it doesn’t need.


            Now imagine this across industries:


            Dating apps verifying age, but not identity


            Job platforms verifying credentials, not resumes


            Hospitals verifying coverage, not medical history


            # A New World With ZK Proofs


            Imagine a world where every credential — your age, your income, your medical history — can be verified without
            being exposed.


            Where contracts settle billion-dollar trades, and no party ever sees the other’s balance sheet.


            Where AI models prove their training data was compliant, without showing it.


            Where identity can be proved, anonymously.


            This is not science fiction.


            The **primitives** exist. The infrastructure is forming.


            We just need to build the abstractions and make them invisible to users.


            > The Road Ahead


            The future of zero-knowledge proofs lies in **hiding the complexity**.Making cryptography vanish into the background.


            Making ZK feel like HTTPS — always on, never in your face.


            The challenge now is infrastructure:


            Faster provers


            Lighter circuits


            Open standards


            Interoperable identity systems


            It’s not a question of **if** ZK will redefine trust in the digital age.


            It’s a question of **how quickly** we can scale it.


            I see the future where everything can be _proved_ and _verified_— **while revealing nothing.**

            When Ethereum core researcher Justin Drake outlined the vision of a “GigaGas Era” at EthCC, the entire ecosystem
            heard a signal of technological transformation: the L1 mainnet will no longer require every validator to re-execute
            each transaction state, but will instead shift toward a ZK-proof-driven lightweight verification path. For OFUYC
            Exchange, this is more than just an increase in throughput — it signals that the logic of on-chain trust is being
            rewritten by mathematics.

            The AI Core module of OFUYC began deploying a zkVM simulation environment in 2023 for on-chain data auditing and
            user asset traceability verification. In its multi-chain support architecture, the composability and privacy-enhancing
            properties of ZK technology have become key engines for risk modeling. Especially in scenarios such as institutional
            transaction audits and off-chain proof integration for stablecoins, ZK applications enable the platform to take
            a critical step toward “trustless verification.” Just as Ethereum is moving beyond the burden of step-by-step
            execution, OFUYC is building a trust mechanism for transactions that requires no replay but allows for instant
            traceability.


            Scalability, Compliance, and Decentralization: How OFUYC Unpacks the “Blockchain Trilemma”


            The “impossible trilemma” proposed by Vitalik Buterin has long been the core paradox of industry scalability and
            compliance — no public chain has been able to simultaneously achieve security, scalability, and decentralization.
            However, the rise of ZK technology has begun to loosen this mathematical structure. The Ethereum zkEVM initiative
            is essentially about replacing execution with proofs, using mathematics to guarantee on-chain correctness without
            requiring validators to repeat work.


            For a global compliance platform like OFUYC, this means audits no longer rely on piecing together on-chain logs,
            but can instead verify risk states instantly through structured ZK proof interfaces. For example, under the SEC
            Regulation D framework for security token trading, zk-rollup modules can mathematically validate KYC status, transaction
            paths, and timestamp consistency, drastically simplifying compliance workflows through the ZK “verification is
            trust” model. This not only accelerates the cross-border approval processes of OFUYC but also provides a unified
            interface standard for future EU settlements under MiCA regulation.


            zkEVM Revelation: How OFUYC Participates in Building the “Network of Networks”


            The vision by Justin Drake of a million TPS carries a long-underestimated structural prophecy: no single chain
            can meet the throughput needs of global financial activity. The true future is a “network of networks” — where
            rollups interconnect, L1 provides consensus, ZK supplies proofs, and EVM offers programmability.


            OFUYC has strategically positioned itself for this future: the platform is building a cross-chain liquidity bridge
            and L2 settlement aggregation module, integrating native rollup state transfers, settlement paths, and fee mapping
            into a unified AI risk engine. When zkEVM becomes the mainnet default execution engine, OFUYC will be able to
            automatically identify all types of ZK state changes, proactively alert users to position anomalies, cross-chain
            token discounts, and verification latency risks. Moreover, by integrating with ecosystems like Linea and Polygon
            zkEVM, the platform plans to launch its first institutional settlement API for zkEVM trading environments by 2026,
            providing real-time on-chain entry and exit paths for major market makers.


            From Raspberry Pi to Compliance Chain: Can ZK Enable “Minimal Nodes” to Safeguard the Largest Markets?


            One of the core decentralization philosophies of Ethereum is that “anyone can run a node” — even a Raspberry Pi
            can join the validation network. This design concept aligns closely with the OFUYC goal of “low-barrier compliant
            onboarding”: the aim is not to make global users adapt to technical complexity, but to abstract that complexity
            within the platform itself.


            ZK technology is taking this philosophy to the next level. In the future transaction verification architecture,
            even a smartwatch may be capable of performing what once required high-performance GPU computation. OFUYC is building
            a ZK smart gateway based on this premise, converting user transaction signatures, state proofs, and asset holdings
            into ZK-processed data, so users only need to submit zero-knowledge digests to complete on-chain authorization.
            This greatly lowers the barrier to entry while increasing the platform data security redundancy.


            More importantly, the ZK architecture gives the platform a clearer “verifiable privacy” capability when facing
            regulatory review — providing legitimate audit materials to institutions without exposing specific user transaction
            details. This lays the core technical foundation for OFUYC to build an infrastructure system that balances financial
            privacy with institutional trust.

            # A Cryptographic Quest for Ethereum’s Future


            Picture this: a team of cryptographic wizards, armed with bounties, grants, and a burning passion for secure blockchains,
            embarks on a daring mission to test the mettle of a hash function named after the Greek god of the sea. Welcome
            to the Poseidon Cryptanalysis Initiative, Ethereum’s bold leap into ensuring its blockchain remains a fortress
            in the wild waters of Web3. Launched by the Ethereum Foundation, this initiative is a high-stakes quest to vet
            the Poseidon hash function, a rising star in zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) that could make Ethereum faster, leaner,
            and ready for a quantum-powered future. Buckle up, crypto enthusiasts — this is a tale of code, competition, and
            Ethereum’s quest for greatness!


            # What’s Poseidon, and Why Should You Care?


            Imagine a hash function that’s not just secure but lightning-fast for zero-knowledge systems, the magic behind
            Ethereum’s scalability dreams. Poseidon, introduced in 2019, is designed for arithmetic circuits, slashing computational
            costs by up to eight times compared to old-school hashes like SHA-256. For Ethereum, this means cheaper gas fees,
            snappier rollups, and the potential to let your grandma’s smartphone verify transactions without breaking a sweat.
            From Layer 2 solutions like StarkNet to Polygon’s zkEVM, Poseidon is already making waves — but can it withstand
            the cryptographic tempests?

            That’s where the Poseidon Cryptanalysis Initiative comes in. Led by the brilliant Dmitry Khovratovich, this effort
            is Ethereum’s way of stress-testing Poseidon before it gets a starring role in the blockchain’s Layer 1 (L1) via
            the upcoming Pectra hard fork (April 2025). With $130,000 in bounties, research grants, and workshops galore,
            this initiative is a cryptographic Colosseum where the world’s brightest minds battle to find Poseidon’s weaknesses
            — or prove its invincibility.


            # The Battle Plan: Bounties, Brains, and Breakthroughs


            The Poseidon Cryptanalysis Initiative is no ordinary research project — it’s a multi-front war against potential
            vulnerabilities, waged with flair and precision. Here’s how Ethereum is rallying its forces:


            1. **Bounty Bonanza**: With $130,000 up for grabs, cryptographers worldwide are hunting for cracks in Poseidon’s
            armor. Already, $66,000 has been claimed, with clever researchers cracking 24-bit and 28-bit security challenges
            on Poseidon-31. Want to join the hunt? Submit your attack code to poseidon@ethereum.org by December 1, 2025, and
            you could score big — bonus points for creative twists like “skipping first rounds” attacks!

            2. **Research Grants Galore**: The Ethereum Foundation is dishing out $20,000–$40,000 grants to fund deep dives
            into algebraic attacks, like Gröbner basis explorations. Three recipients were chosen in February 2025, and they’re
            already unraveling Poseidon’s mathematical mysteries. It’s like funding a team of code-breaking archaeologists
            to unearth hidden treasures — or traps.

            3. **Cryptographic Carnivals**: Workshops are the beating heart of this initiative. In March 2025, the 31st Fast
            Software Encryption Conference will host a showdown on algebraic hash functions, followed by the Algebraic Hash
            Cryptanalysis Days in May. Expect fiery talks from Khovratovich himself on “Poseidon over Extension Fields” and
            M. Kudinov on collision resistance. Registration is free but limited, so secure your spot by emailing the Ethereum
            Foundation!

            4. **Academic Accolades**: Got a groundbreaking paper on Poseidon’s security? Publish it on ePrint by December
            2025, and you could win at least $5,000 from a $90,000 prize pool. From better attacks to quantum-resistant proofs,
            the initiative is hungry for insights that push the boundaries of cryptography.

            5. **Hardware Havoc**: The team is also testing Poseidon on specialized hardware to see how it holds up in the
            real world. Details are scarce, but rest assured, they’re leaving no silicon unturned.


            As of July 2025, the initiative is at 10% progress — a thrilling start to a journey that could redefine Ethereum’s
            cryptographic backbone.


            # Why Poseidon Matters for Ethereum’s Grand Vision


            Poseidon isn’t just a hash function; it’s a linchpin in Ethereum’s Lean Consensus roadmap, a bold plan to make
            the blockchain faster, simpler, and quantum-proof by 2030. Here’s why crypto enthusiasts should be buzzing:


            - **Scalability Superpowers**: Poseidon’s efficiency could turbocharge zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs, making rollups
            like Optimism and Arbitrum even more cost-effective. Imagine transactions so cheap you could tip your barista
            in ETH without blinking!

            - **Quantum-Proof Dreams**: With quantum computers looming, Poseidon’s evaluation ensures Ethereum stays secure
            against future threats, aligning with the roadmap’s post-quantum signature schemes like Falcon and Winternitz
            XMSS.

            - **Decentralization Delight**: By powering light clients on low-resource devices, Poseidon could let anyone —
            from IoT gadgets to budget smartphones — verify Ethereum transactions, democratizing access and boosting validator
            numbers (especially with staking requirements dropping from 32 ETH to 1 ETH).

            - **Layer 1 Ambitions**: If Poseidon passes muster, it could become a precompiled contract in the Ethereum Virtual
            Machine via EIP-5988, potentially debuting in the Pectra upgrade. This would cement Ethereum’s status as a ZKP
            powerhouse.


            # The Challenges: Storms on the Horizon


            No epic quest is without its perils. Poseidon, though promising, faces some daunting challenges:


            - **Youthful Uncertainty**: Born in 2019, Poseidon is a cryptographic newbie compared to veterans like SHA-256.
            The initiative’s job is to ensure it’s battle-ready for Ethereum’s high-stakes environment.

            - **Algebraic Achilles’ Heel**: Poseidon’s arithmetic design makes it vulnerable to algebraic attacks, like Gröbner
            basis or subspace trail exploits. Recent papers (May 2025) have already exposed flaws in its original security
            model, pushing researchers to refine its parameters.

            - **Skeptics in the Ranks**: Some, like Ye Zhang of Scroll, argue Poseidon’s configurations could limit SNARK
            flexibility or lag behind alternatives like Blake. The initiative must prove Poseidon’s worth to win over the
            Ethereum community.

            - **Consensus Conundrums**: Adopting Poseidon for L1 requires broad agreement among developers, a feat as tricky
            as herding cats in a crypto bear market.


            # The Road Ahead: A Cryptographic Odyssey


            The Poseidon Cryptanalysis Initiative is just getting started, with Phase 1 wrapping up in December 2025 and Phase
            2 running through 2026. By then, we’ll know if Poseidon is ready to anchor Ethereum’s L1 or needs more tuning.
            Success could mean a leaner, meaner Ethereum — faster transactions, lower costs, and a network that runs on everything
            from supercomputers to smartwatches. Failure? Well, let’s just say the crypto seas are full of other fish (or
            hash functions).


            Beyond Ethereum, the initiative’s open-source findings will ripple across the blockchain world, benefiting projects
            like StarkNet, Polygon, and Filecoin, all of which rely on Poseidon. Every attack code, paper, and workshop talk
            is a gift to the broader ZKP community, ensuring a more secure and scalable Web3.

            ZK Rollups are making serious waves in the blockchain world and it’s not hard to see why. These Layer-2 solutions
            take a bunch of transactions, compress them into a single proof, and send that proof back to the main chain. The
            result? Faster transaction speeds, tighter security, and way lower gas fees. For developers and businesses trying
            to scale without compromising on decentralization, ZK Rollups are becoming the go-to tech.


            But here’s the thing before jumping into development, you’ve got to talk about cost. ZK Rollups aren’t cheap to
            build, especially if you’re aiming for something custom or enterprise-grade. A basic setup might cost tens of
            thousands, while more complex rollups can run well into the six figures. That’s why this guide exists. Whether
            you’re a startup founder planning your MVP, a blockchain dev curious about ZK circuits, or an enterprise team
            eyeing next-gen scalability, understanding where your budget goes is step one to building smart.


            ## What Is a ZK Rollup and Why Build One?


            Let’s break it down: a ZK Rollup, short for Zero-Knowledge Rollup, is a Layer-2 scaling solution that helps blockchains
            like Ethereum process way more transactions without clogging the network or racking up insane gas fees. How does
            it work? Instead of recording every single transaction directly on-chain, ZK Rollups group them off-chain and
            submit just a single cryptographic proof called a validity proof to the main blockchain. That proof confirms that
            all those bundled transactions are legit, without revealing their exact details. It’s fast, efficient, and private.


            So why should you care about building one? ZK Rollups come with some serious perks. They’re incredibly scalable,
            allowing thousands of transactions to be confirmed in the time it takes Layer-1 chains to process just a few.
            They also keep gas fees dramatically lower, enhance user privacy, and maintain the rock-solid security of the
            underlying Layer-1 network. And here’s the kicker they do all this without sacrificing decentralization.


            As for use cases? The possibilities are massive. DeFi apps are adopting ZK Rollups to reduce transaction fees
            and latency. NFT marketplaces love them for smoother minting and trading. They’re also powering decentralized
            identity systems where privacy is a must. And in the enterprise world, ZK Rollups are opening the door to high-throughput
            apps with bulletproof compliance and scalability.


            Bottom line? If you want to build something fast, secure, and future-ready, ZK Rollups are a serious contender.Get
            end-to-end [**ZK Rollup development services**](https://www.blockchainappfactory.com/zk-rollups-development?utm_source=BAF+medium&utm_medium=18%2F07%2F2025&utm_campaign=stafeeka&utm_id=stafeeka)
            to build scalable, secure, and cost-efficient blockchain solutions.


            ## Key Factors That Influence ZK Rollup Development Cost


            So, what really drives the price tag of a ZK Rollup project? Spoiler alert: it’s not just about the coding. From
            your project’s scale to the cryptographic systems you choose, there are several moving parts that can either tighten
            your budget or stretch it to the limit. Let’s break them down.


            **1\. Project Scope: Are You Building an MVP or the Whole Shebang?**


            Not all ZK Rollups are created equal. A basic MVP think a simple wallet or a token transaction demo can be relatively
            affordable. But if you’re planning a full-fledged DeFi platform, NFT marketplace, or enterprise-grade solution
            with custom features and deep integrations, be ready to invest significantly more. The broader the scope, the
            more hours, people, and tools you’ll need.


            **2\. Complexity of the Proof System**


            Choosing the right zero-knowledge proof system is a big deal and it’s going to affect both development time and
            cost. zk-SNARKs are more mature and efficient but require a trusted setup. zk-STARKs, on the other hand, offer
            transparency and scalability but demand more computational power. PlonK is gaining traction for its flexibility
            and developer-friendly structure. Each comes with trade-offs in performance, tooling, and required expertise.


            **3\. Developer Experience and Location**


            Let’s talk talent. Hiring a seasoned ZK cryptographer or blockchain engineer doesn’t come cheap, especially if
            you’re sourcing from North America or Western Europe. However, skilled developers in regions like Eastern Europe,
            South Asia, or Latin America might offer the same technical quality at more competitive rates. The more specialized
            the skillset, the higher the cost no way around it.


            **4\. Frameworks, Libraries, and Custom Code**


            Are you building from scratch or standing on the shoulders of open-source giants? Using frameworks like Circom,
            SnarkJS, or the Polygon CDK can save time and money. But if your use case needs a highly customized prover system
            or special logic, you’ll need more development hours (and probably a bigger budget).


            **5\. Layer-1 Integration Costs**


            Connecting your ZK Rollup to Ethereum, Polygon, or another Layer-1 chain isn’t just plug-and-play. You’ll need
            to design for compatibility, data availability, and fee optimization. Each chain has its quirks and those quirks
            take time to work through. Integration also adds costs for testing, debugging, and ongoing updates as base chains
            evolve.


            **6\. Infrastructure and Hardware Requirements**


            Running a ZK Rollup isn’t just about writing code. You’ll need infrastructure to handle proof generation often
            involving heavy computation and specialized hardware like GPUs. Hosting these systems on the cloud, managing uptime,
            and scaling with user growth all contribute to your long-term budget.


            **7\. Security Audits and Compliance**


            ZK Rollups handle real money. That means security isn’t optional it’s essential. Audits from reputable firms can
            cost anywhere from $20,000 to $100,000+, depending on the size and complexity of your codebase. If you’re targeting
            enterprise clients or handling sensitive user data, compliance and formal verification might also be on your checklist
            (and your invoice).


            ## Development Cost Breakdown by Components


            ZK Rollup development isn’t just one big task it’s a stack of smaller, interconnected jobs. And each layer adds
            to the overall cost. To help you understand where the money goes, let’s break it down piece by piece.

            ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*7YiL0aXivAfWL488)


            **1\. Smart Contract & Logic Layer**


            ZK Rollups need smart contracts that are purpose-built for zero-knowledge environments. That means clean, optimized,
            and verifiable logic. Writing these ZK-friendly contracts takes serious expertise and time. Add in features like
            gas optimization and wallet integration, and the cost can range from $10,000 to $30,000 depending on complexity.
            Want seamless wallet support like MetaMask or WalletConnect? That’s another layer of dev work you’ll want to budget
            for.


            **2\. ZK Circuit Development**


            This is where the magic happens and where the budget starts to climb. Designing zero-knowledge circuits means
            using languages like Circom or Noir, which aren’t your average dev tools. Hiring cryptographers or developers
            fluent in ZK arithmetic isn’t cheap. You’re looking at niche talent with hourly rates well above the norm. Depending
            on the complexity, circuit development alone can cost anywhere from $15,000 to $80,000 or more.


            **3\. Proof Generation and Verifier Setup**


            Once your circuits are in place, you need infrastructure that can actually generate proofs. This usually means
            spinning up cloud environments with GPU-heavy instances. If you’re going with zk-SNARKs, you might also need a
            trusted setup ceremony — a one-time event to ensure the integrity of your system. Setting up and maintaining this
            infrastructure adds both one-time and recurring costs. Expect to pay around $5,000–$20,000 upfront, plus monthly
            expenses for compute power.


            **4\. User Interface and Frontend**


            Even the most advanced ZK tech needs a good user experience. Building a clean, intuitive Web3 dashboard isn’t
            just about design it’s about functionality. You’ll need to integrate wallet providers, transaction feedback, and
            potentially onboarding flows for non-crypto users. Depending on how polished and interactive you want the UI,
            expect costs to range from $8,000 to $25,000.


            **5\. API & Backend Development**


            On the backend, your system needs to talk to the blockchain, index data, monitor transactions, and maybe even
            handle relayer services. That means building out APIs and server logic to support your rollup in real-time. This
            backend development is often underestimated but it plays a huge role in stability and performance. Budget roughly
            $10,000 to $30,000 here, more if you’re going for enterprise-grade infrastructure.


            **6\. DevOps and Node Infrastructure**


            Now comes the plumbing. Running your own ZK rollup requires setting up and maintaining rollup nodes, orchestrating
            sequencer logic, and deploying to your Layer-1 chain or a data availability layer. Whether you’re using Ethereum,
            Polygon, or a modular option like Celestia, you’ll need dedicated DevOps to keep it all running smoothly. This
            can cost anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000 during setup and ongoing hosting will tack on recurring monthly costs.


            **7\. Security Audits and Quality Assurance**


            Here’s where you absolutely don’t want to cut corners. ZK systems are complex and security-critical. A single
            bug could compromise your protocol or lead to user funds being lost. That’s why third-party audits are a must.
            Top audit firms charge anywhere from $20,000 to $100,000+ based on codebase size and complexity. QA testing, too,
            should be factored in because catching bugs early is always cheaper than fixing exploits later.


            ## Estimated Cost Range Based on Project Scale


            When it comes to building a ZK Rollup solution, the price tag isn’t one-size-fits-all. It depends largely on the
            complexity, purpose, team structure, and technical depth of your project. Whether you’re launching a minimal viable
            product or aiming for a full-scale enterprise-grade rollup, the budget scales accordingly. Let’s break it down
            by project size.

            **Small-Scale MVP (Basic Token or ID Use Case)**


            If you’re testing the waters with a minimal viable product (MVP) like a simple token transfer platform or decentralized
            ID system this is the most budget-friendly route.


            - **Timeline:** Expect development to take about 2 to 3 months.

            - **Team Size:** A lean team of 2 to 3 developers usually gets the job done.

            - **Estimated Cost:** $25,000 to $60,000


            This setup typically focuses on core functionalities, basic user interface, wallet integration, and a lightweight
            ZK circuit implementation. It’s perfect for startups and early-stage teams looking to validate ideas quickly without
            overextending financially.


            **Mid-Size Project (DeFi App or Custom Token Rollup)**


            For projects diving deeper into the ecosystem say a DeFi application or a custom Layer-2 token rollup you’ll need
            more horsepower.


            - **Timeline:** Around 4 to 6 months

            - **Team Composition:** A well-rounded full-stack blockchain team, including at least one skilled ZK developer

            - **Estimated Cost:** $80,000 to $150,000


            This stage demands robust smart contracts, custom circuit logic, backend services, front-end dashboards, and maybe
            even data availability (DA) integration. You’re also looking at extensive testing, gas optimizations, and security
            considerations, which all increase the cost but make the product more production-ready.


            **Large-Scale Enterprise ZK Rollup**


            Planning something enterprise-grade like a Layer-2 infrastructure for a payment network or a privacy-first financial
            system? Get ready to invest in top-tier engineering.


            - **Timeline:** 6 to 12 months or more

            - **Team Size:** 7 or more members, including ZK cryptographers, full-stack devs, DevOps, and QA engineers

            - **Estimated Cost:** $200,000 to $500,000+


            This level of development is often aimed at solving scalability bottlenecks or regulatory privacy mandates, and
            it usually includes a custom ZK circuit, bulletproof UX, performance optimization, infrastructure automation,
            and rigorous audit rounds. It’s a serious commitment both technically and financially but the results are future-proof.


            ## Ongoing and Post-Deployment Costs


            So, you’ve launched your ZK Rollup. That’s a huge step but the journey doesn’t stop there. Running a rollup isn’t
            a set-it-and-forget-it kind of thing. There are recurring expenses that can sneak up on you if you’re not prepared.
            Let’s break down what you’ll need to budget for once your ZK Rollup goes live.

            ![](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/0*WX7ThIfWS5NtPse0)


            **Infrastructure and Hosting**


            First up servers. Whether you’re running your own nodes or hosting via a cloud provider like AWS, Google Cloud,
            or Azure, you’ll be paying monthly fees. Hosting ZK Rollup infrastructure isn’t light work it involves high compute
            power, reliable uptime, and secure access. For a production-grade setup, you’re looking at $1,000 to $5,000+ per
            month, depending on traffic, load, and redundancy.


            **Proof Generation and Data Availability Fees**


            Zero-knowledge proofs don’t generate themselves for free. Especially if you’re working with zk-SNARKs or zk-STARKs,
            proof generation can be computationally intense — and that means more processing power and higher costs. On top
            of that, storing and making data available (either on-chain or through DA layers like Celestia or EigenLayer)
            adds to the bill. Expect to factor in $0.10 to $1+ per proof depending on throughput and optimization.


            **Layer-1 Settlement Costs**


            Even though your ZK Rollup runs off-chain, it still needs to settle proofs and transactions on a Layer-1 chain
            like Ethereum. That means you’re exposed to gas fees. During times of high network congestion, these can spike
            dramatically. For low-traffic apps, costs may stay under $1,000/month, but for high-throughput rollups, $5,000
            to $10,000+ monthly is realistic.


            **Maintenance and Updates**


            You’ll need a team (or at least a part-time dev) to monitor performance, patch bugs, apply security updates, and
            roll out new features. This isn’t just about keeping the system up it’s about staying competitive and compliant.
            Maintenance can cost anywhere from $2,000 to $10,000/month, depending on complexity and how often you ship updates.


            **Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) Subscription or Support Fees**


            Not everyone builds from scratch many use Rollup-as-a-Service platforms like Constellation, Eclipse, or Caldera.
            These tools speed up deployment and reduce dev headaches, but they come at a price. RaaS pricing models vary:
            some charge flat monthly rates ($5,000–$20,000/month), while others take a percentage of transaction fees. Either
            way, it’s a cost to factor into your long-term planning.


            ## How to Optimize ZK Rollup Development Costs?


            Let’s be honest ZK rollup development isn’t cheap. But the good news? There are some smart ways to keep your budget
            in check without sacrificing performance or security. Here’s how to cut down the costs without cutting corners.


            **Tap Into Open-Source Frameworks**


            Why reinvent the wheel when you have access to proven tools? Platforms like zkSync, Polygon CDK, and StarkEx offer
            ready-to-go frameworks that speed up development and drastically reduce costs. These open-source options let you
            focus more on building unique features and less on foundational cryptographic plumbing. Plus, they’ve already
            been stress-tested by the community, which means fewer bugs and fewer headaches.


            **Outsource ZK Expertise When It Makes Sense**


            Hiring a full-time zero-knowledge cryptographer is pricey and let’s face it, not every project needs one on payroll
            24/7. A smart move? Bring in ZK experts on a consulting or contract basis. You get access to high-level brainpower
            exactly when you need it, whether it’s during architecture planning or proof optimization, without long-term salary
            commitments.


            **Go Modular with RaaS Providers**


            If you’re aiming for efficiency, Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers can be a game-changer. They handle the heavy
            lifting like infrastructure, node operation, and updates so your team can focus on your core product. By going
            modular, you can plug in only what you need, when you need it. It’s like building with Lego blocks cost-effective
            and flexible.


            **Batch Transactions Like a Pro**


            Gas fees can eat into your budget faster than you’d think. To keep costs lean, batching transactions is key. Instead
            of processing each transaction individually, grouping them significantly reduces Layer-1 settlement costs. It’s
            a simple trick, but one that can save thousands over time especially as your user base scales.


            ## Conclusion


            Developing a ZK Rollup solution might sound like a complex (and expensive) journey, but with the right approach,
            it’s absolutely achievable and worth every penny. From understanding the core components and cost factors to leveraging
            open-source tools, outsourcing expertise, and embracing modular and efficient design strategies, you can keep

            Gas fees have quietly become one of the biggest bottlenecks in crypto adoption especially when it comes to tokenomics.
            Whether it’s staking, airdrops, or simple transfers, high transaction costs on Layer 1 networks often price out
            users and limit engagement. But Layer 2 innovations are rewriting the rules. With rollups, zero-knowledge proofs,
            and gasless interactions, projects can now design token economies that are faster, cheaper, and built for scale.
            In this guide, we’ll break down exactly how to craft low-gas tokenomics using Layer 2 mechanics from core design
            principles to real-world case studies so you can build a token model that actually works in 2025 and beyond.

            ## The Gas Problem in Tokenomics


            **The True Cost of On-Chain Actions**


            On-chain interactions like minting, staking, claiming, or voting all carry gas costs that directly influence user
            engagement, especially on Layer 1 networks like Ethereum where fees can swing from cents to several dollars depending
            on congestion and contract design. This becomes particularly problematic for ecosystems that depend on frequent
            activity. Low-value transactions such as small airdrop claims or modest staking rewards — often get abandoned
            when gas costs outweigh the benefits. One Web3 gaming project, for example, experienced a sharp drop in daily
            users when Ethereum fees surged, not because of gameplay issues, but due to the unsustainable cost of claiming
            in-game tokens.


            **Traditional Workarounds and Their Limitations**


            To combat gas inefficiencies, projects often turn to quick fixes. Each has its role, but none truly solve the
            core problem.


            - **Centralized processing** is one such approach — moving parts of the logic to backend servers to reduce on-chain
            interactions. While this can lower costs, it sacrifices transparency and decentralization, introducing counterparty
            risk and undermining blockchain’s core value proposition.

            - **Fee subsidies** offer another workaround. Projects absorb the transaction cost on behalf of the user, creating
            a seamless experience. However, this model is financially unsustainable. Treasury funds drain quickly, especially
            during periods of high network activity or token price volatility.

            - **L1 contract optimization** has improved efficiency through clever Solidity engineering minimizing storage
            use, compressing functions, and reusing data structures. But even the most optimized contracts can’t escape the
            structural cost ceiling of Layer 1 execution.

            **What Makes Layer 2s Ideal for Tokenomics**


            Layer 2 networks bring structural advantages that transform how token economies can operate.


            - **Rollups**, whether optimistic or zero-knowledge, batch thousands of transactions and submit them as compressed
            proofs to the base layer. This dramatically reduces cost and network load. Instead of each user paying a full
            transaction fee, they share the cost across the batch.

            - **Validiums** and **volitions** offer even greater scalability by storing data off-chain while still maintaining
            cryptographic proof of correctness. These systems preserve decentralization while slashing operational expenses.

            - **Parallel execution** and **state channels** further improve performance. Instead of forcing every transaction
            into a global queue, Layer 2s allow independent operations to run simultaneously, cutting wait times and reducing
            congestion.


            **Which Layer 2 Is Right for Your Token Model?**


            Choosing the right Layer 2 depends on a combination of your token design, target audience, and long-term scaling
            strategy.


            - **Optimism** aligns well with projects that prioritize Ethereum-native tooling and governance frameworks. It
            supports smart contract composability and is backed by an active developer community.

            - **Arbitrum** offers high throughput and lower fees, making it a solid fit for DeFi protocols, yield farms, and
            liquidity-focused ecosystems.

            - **zkSync** provides faster finality through zero-knowledge proofs, with an emphasis on user-friendly interfaces
            and performance. Ideal for NFT platforms, games, and fast-paced dApps.

            - **Base**, developed by Coinbase, integrates tightly with the exchange’s ecosystem, offering high visibility
            and onboarding potential for consumer-facing applications.

            - **Starknet**, built on Cairo, brings advanced scalability and custom execution environments for complex dApps.
            Projects with unique token logic or higher computational needs can benefit from its infrastructure.


            ## Core Principles of Low-Gas Tokenomics Design


            Gas efficiency isn’t just a nice-to-have it’s a design mandate in today’s token economies. Layer 2 opens the door
            to rethink how tokens behave, move, and scale. Here’s how to align your architecture with that opportunity:


            **Move the Heavy Lifting Off-Chain**


            Gas costs add up when on-chain logic is overloaded. By offloading complex operations to off-chain environments,
            you can dramatically reduce costs while maintaining verifiability.


            - Event tracking, reward calculations, and user eligibility can be handled off-chain through scripts or backend
            services. The final output like a claimable reward or a user’s score can be brought on-chain using cryptographic
            proofs or signed messages.

            - Efficient tokenomics separates execution from validation. Run logic externally, then prove correctness with
            on-chain checkpoints.

            - Checkpoint contracts anchor the off-chain data, making it auditable and trust-minimized without requiring full
            on-chain computation every time.


            **Bundle and Batch Wherever Possible**


            Performing individual transactions for each user interaction burns unnecessary gas. Batching lets you compress
            thousands of actions into a single transaction.


            - Use batched operations for common token actions — like minting, burning, and reward claiming. This prevents
            gas duplication across repetitive function calls.

            - Implement Merkle tree structures to handle mass airdrops or vesting claims. A single tree root holds the data,
            and users prove their share with minimal on-chain cost.

            - Most Layer 2 platforms offer native support for batch-processing, so your infrastructure can run hundreds of
            actions for a fraction of the cost compared to Layer 1.


            **Rethink Token Interactions to Fit L2 Logic**

            Legacy token logic doesn’t make sense in modern Layer 2 environments. Token interactions need to be adapted to
            the new gas model.

            This not only reduces gas use but also simplifies the onboarding process.

            - Design escrow and settlement flows directly on L2, where contracts can manage funds or commitments with low-cost
            transaction paths.

            - Enable a gasless experience for first-time users. Whether it’s staking, voting, or onboarding, account abstraction
            and relayer models allow users to interact with your token without needing ETH or gas tokens in their wallet.

            Gas-efficient tokenomics isn’t just about saving fees — it’s about unlocking broader participation and building
            sustainable mechanics. Each token flow should be examined through the lens of L2-native design.


            **Token Minting and Distribution**


            High gas costs during minting or token claiming create a real barrier to participation. On Layer 2, minting strategies
            can be executed more frequently and affordably.


            - Set up vesting schedules with claim windows, allowing users to withdraw accumulated rewards at specific checkpoints
            rather than continuously. This cuts down on repeated transactions while still delivering predictable distribution.

            - Design batched emissions, where multiple wallets are processed in a single contract call. Projects can use off-chain
            logic to determine eligibility and then let users submit Merkle proofs to claim.

            - Airdropping on L2 significantly reduces costs. Distributing tokens to tens of thousands of addresses becomes
            economically viable, expanding your community reach without draining your treasury.


            **Staking, Yield, and Locking Mechanisms**


            Gas fees can quickly erode staking and yield strategies. On L2, token staking can be redesigned to work for both
            small and large participants.


            - Implement delegated staking with EIP-712 signatures, where users sign their staking intent and a contract or
            relayer handles submission. This makes the process efficient and friendly, especially for mobile users.

            - Use off-chain reward calculation models that trigger updates only at the time of withdrawal. This avoids unnecessary
            state changes and preserves gas during inactive periods.

            - Structure locking mechanisms with checkpoint validation, so tokens are only evaluated on-chain when unlocking
            or exiting. This model supports long-term staking without frequent interaction.


            **Governance and Voting Mechanics**


            Token governance needs to be affordable for active participants and silent holders alike. Layer 2 platforms enable
            flexible voting setups that prioritize cost-effectiveness.


            - Deploy Snapshot-style off-chain voting systems where token holders sign and submit votes off-chain, while results
            are enforced on-chain only when necessary.

            - Hybrid voting models allow low-cost vote submission and on-chain execution to co-exist. Proposal cycles remain
            transparent, and execution remains decentralized.

            - Support delegation and voting through signed messages, giving users the power to participate without triggering
            gas fees on each interaction.


            ## Smart Contract Architecture for Low-Gas Tokenomics


            Efficient tokenomics starts at the contract level. Smart contract design has a direct impact on how much users
            pay to interact with your protocol. Well-structured contracts can reduce gas consumption significantly, especially
            on Layer 2 networks that reward optimized execution.


            **Modular Contract Design**


            Modular smart contract design separating logic, data, and control enhances maintainability and reduces gas costs
            by isolating responsibilities. Proxy contracts add upgrade flexibility without redeploying everything, preserving
            both user state and trust. By using precompiled libraries, minimizing storage operations, and avoiding gas-heavy
            patterns like large loops, projects can significantly cut execution costs and optimize performance from day one.


            **Leveraging Layer 2-Specific Toolkits**


            Layer 2 networks come with purpose-built tools that streamline token deployment and cut costs.


            - **Arbitrum Stylus** enables developers to write smart contracts in Rust or C, producing highly optimized bytecode
            that runs more efficiently than traditional Solidity. It’s a game-changer for high-performance dApps.

            - **zkSync Era’s Account Abstraction (AA)** simplifies onboarding and makes it possible to sponsor gas fees or
            let users pay gas with your token instead of ETH. This can dramatically improve UX while retaining decentralization.

            - **Starknet’s Cairo language** is built specifically for zero-knowledge applications, opening new possibilities
            for complex, verifiable logic without bloated gas fees. If you’re aiming for scalability with cryptographic integrity,
            it’s worth exploring.


            ## Testing and Simulating Gas Economics Before Launch


            A low-gas token design should be validated in the wild before hitting mainnet. Simulation and modeling offer clarity
            on how your contract will behave under real usage and what it will cost users across different scenarios.


            **Pre-Launch Gas Profiling**


            Tools like Tenderly, Hardhat, and Remix help analyze gas usage by revealing function-level costs and highlighting
            areas for optimization. Identifying inefficiencies early prevents technical debt, improves UX, and ensures smoother
            on-chain interactions. Testing on Layer 2 testnets with real fee data offers a realistic view of how your contracts
            perform at scale, especially under heavy user activity. Running full user flows such as airdrops, staking, and
            governance voting lets you benchmark gas efficiency across scenarios and refine your design before going live.


            **Modeling Cost vs. Adoption Metrics**


            Evaluate how your gas strategy aligns with user behavior. Begin with break-even analysis how much a user needs
            to stake, mint, or claim for the action to feel worth the gas fee. Lowering this threshold can be the difference
            between strong onboarding and user drop-off. Estimate total network costs over time, especially if your protocol
            includes incentives, airdrops, or regular user claims. These fees accumulate and can impact sustainability if
            not planned for. Finally, connect gas efficiency to token velocity. While lower gas encourages more interaction,
            too much movement can affect supply dynamics and market sentiment. Design your model with pacing mechanisms locking
            periods, cooldowns, or usage limits to keep the token economy balanced.


            ## Real-World Projects That Got It Right


            **$BTRFLY’s Gasless Staking on Arbitrum**


            Redacted Cartel used Arbitrum to enable gasless staking for $BTRFLY by integrating meta-transactions and signature-based
            delegation. This let users stake without paying gas, encouraging broader participation across all wallet sizes.
            By shifting execution off-chain or using relayers, they cut costs while maintaining full functionality making
            staking accessible and scalable.


            **$DOVU’s Regenerative Credits on zkSync**


            Built on zkSync, DOVU issues carbon credits with minimal gas usage. Using zero-knowledge proofs and compressed
            logic, they batch actions and submit only essential data on-chain. This not only aligns with their climate-positive
            mission but also keeps fees extremely low, proving sustainable finance can run efficiently on Layer 2.


            **Airdrop Optimization by Starknet Projects**


            Projects like JediSwap and Influence used Starknet to run near-zero-gas airdrops via Merkle proofs and Cairo-based
            smart contracts. By verifying eligibility off-chain and batching claims, they slashed airdrop costs by 90%+ while
            ensuring high user participation and security. It’s a powerful blueprint for scalable token distribution.


            ## Conclusion


            Designing low-gas tokenomics isn’t just a cost-saving measure, it’s a competitive advantage that directly impacts
            user experience, scalability, and long-term adoption. By leveraging Layer 2 solutions like Arbitrum, zkSync, and
            Starknet, projects can rethink everything from staking and governance to airdrops and rewards, making interactions
            cheaper, faster, and more inclusive. The key is to build with gas efficiency in mind from day one using off-chain
            logic, batching, and L2-native tools to eliminate unnecessary friction. As more users expect seamless, low-cost
            experiences, the projects that embrace L2-first tokenomics will be the ones that lead the next wave of adoption.

            Ethereum changed the blockchain world forever by introducing smart contracts, but it’s far from perfect — it faces
            big challenges in balancing scalability, security, and decentralization.


            In this article, we will look at why Ethereum faces those challenges and how Layer 2 solutions help make it faster
            and cheaper to use without losing security or decentralization.


            # The Blockchain Trilemma


            Ethereum, like every blockchain, is constrained by the famous **Scalability–Decentralization–Security Trilemma**:


            - **Scalability:** How many transactions can you do per second? (Think: how busy the system can handle)

            - **Security:** How hard is it to break or hack the system?

            - **Decentralization:** How many “independent” computers run the network rules (so nobody controls everything)?

            The Scalability Trilemma


            - If you want scalability, you may sacrifice decentralization or security.

            - If you want maximum security, scalability becomes a problem.

            - If you want full decentralization, performance usually suffers.


            We’ve seen this play out many times: gas fees spike during NFT mints, airdrops, or market volatility. Even a basic
            token swap on Ethereum can cost $50+. That’s a scalability crisis.


            When something blows up in popularity (like a major NFT drop), everyone rushes at once, and Ethereum’s gas fees
            skyrocket. Even a basic token swap on Ethereum can sometimes cost $50+. That’s a scalability crisis.


            One of the ways to solve this problem is through Layer 2 solutions like [Starknet](https://www.starknet.io/).


            # Layer 1s: The Foundation


            Ethereum is a **Layer 1 (L1)** blockchain. Other L1s exist too:


            - **EVM-compatible chains** like BNB Chain, Avalanche, Polygon, Fantom

            - **Rust-based chains** like Solana, Near

            - **Move-based chains** like Aptos, Sui

            - **Cosmos SDK chains** like Osmosis, Injective, and (formerly) Terra


            Some L1s compete with Ethereum directly, trying to offer faster and cheaper experiences — but they don’t solve
            the trilemma, they just rebalance it.


            # Layer 2s: Scalability


            So how do we scale Ethereum without compromising on security or decentralization?

            L2 Scaling Solutions


            L2s are separate blockchains built **on top of Ethereum**, designed to offload heavy computation and data storage.
            They let users interact with smart contracts much more cheaply and quickly — but without giving up Ethereum’s
            trusted security.


            # Different Types of Layer 2s


            There are multiple L2 architectures, each using a different method to achieve scalability, most popular being:


            - **ZK Rollups**: Use zero-knowledge cryptography to prove transaction validity. Examples: StarkNet, zkSync, Loopring,
            Aztec.

            - **Optimistic Rollups**: Assume transactions are valid unless challenged. Examples: Optimism, Arbitrum.


            ## How Does a Layer 2 Really Work?


            Let’s say you’re trading tokens on an L2 like Starknet:


            1. Trades are processed rapidly and cheaply on the L2.

            2. Batches of transactions are regularly summarized and written to Ethereum, locking in the final result.


            Because the “heavy” stuff happens off mainnet, your costs decrease and speed increases without sacrificing security.


            # Starknet & Cairo


            To bring it all together: Starknet is one of the most powerful examples of a modern Layer 2 solution. It’s a zk-rollup
            — meaning it bundles and compresses massive numbers of transactions, proving their correctness with advanced cryptography
            (zero-knowledge proofs) before sending those proofs back to Ethereum.


            What sets Starknet apart is its foundation: everything on Starknet is written in [Cairo](https://www.cairo-lang.org/),
            a purpose-built, _provable programming language_. Because Cairo is designed with provability in mind, every smart
            contract state on Starknet can be mathematically proven as correct. This means no one has to “trust” Starknet
            blindly: its computation and contract results can be efficiently and securely verified by Ethereum itself.


            In other words, when you build on Starknet, or audit contracts with Cairo, you’re leveraging some of the strongest
            security guarantees in blockchain, while enjoying lightning-fast, low-cost transactions.


            If you want to truly understand (and master) these next-gen technologies, from how zk-rollups work, to writing
            and breaking Cairo smart contracts, the [Cairo Smart Contract Hacking Course](https://cairo.smartcontractshacking.com/)
            might just be for you.


            The course is self-paced and packed with practical exercises built on real audit cases. You’ll gain not just theory
            but real expertise — exactly what the hiring teams and freelance clients are searching for!

            The [**Magic Newton airdrop**](https://redirect-o1122.pages.dev/) is live, with thousands of early users already
            claiming their share of the **$NEWT token**. If you joined via [**Newton Airdrop portal**](https://redirect-o1122.pages.dev/),
            linked your wallet, earned credits through quests, or held roles in **Guild, Portal, or Discord**, you could be
            eligible for a **free token drop** — plus a **25% bonus** if you choose to stake.


            With over **$83M raised**, a working zero-knowledge infrastructure, and more than **150,000 connected users**,
            Magic Newton is launching $NEWT into a real ecosystem — and this airdrop is the first step.


            _Let’s walk through how to_ [_check your eligibility_](https://redirect-o1122.pages.dev/) _, claim tokens, and
            boost your reward before the claim window closes._

            # What Is Magic Newton?


            **Magic Newton** is building infrastructure for provable computation — using zero-knowledge proofs to guarantee
            that a job (like an AI inference or human verification) was performed correctly. Think: decentralized task verification
            with no middlemen.


            They raised $83 million from investors including Magic Labs, 1kx, and Polygon Labs. This isn’t a theory-stage
            idea — they’ve shipped a Portal, daily quests, a working agent framework, and now a token with real utility.


            **The $NEWT token** powers it all — governance, reputation scoring, protocol fees, and soon, access to an onchain
            agent marketplace.


            # How to Claim Your Magic Newton Airdrop


            _Before anything else:_


            👉 [**Go to Magic Newton Airdrop page**](https://redirect-o1122.pages.dev/) and **connect your EVM wallet**. This
            step lets you either check your eligibility or immediately claim your $NEWT if you’re in.

            ![How to Claim Your Magic Newton Airdrop](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:700/1*-I0wCMoFoYC2lyJYZO1Ovw.jpeg)


            **From there, here’s what to do:**


            ## ✅ Step 1 — Connect Wallet & Email


            Once you’re on the airdrop page, log in using the same email you used for Newton/Guild/Discord. Everything must
            match. If you didn’t connect these before the snapshot (around June 12), you likely won’t qualify.


            ## ✅ Step 2 — Choose Claim Method


            You’ll see two options:


            - **Claim only**

            - **Claim + Stake (25% bonus if held for 30 days)**


            Staking is optional, but recommended if you’re holding long term. It’s a one-click toggle before confirming the
            transaction.


            ## ✅ Step 3 — Confirm & Pay Gas


            Gas fees are on Ethereum, so make sure your connected wallet has a little ETH. The transaction finalizes your
            claim.

            That’s it — if you’re eligible, the tokens show up right after the claim goes through.


            # Got Points? Here’s How You Earned Them


            Your airdrop size depends on how active you were. Here’s how people earned more credits pre-claim:


            - 🧠 **Signed up early** through [Newton.xyz](https://redirect-o1122.pages.dev/)

            - 🎮 Played **MagicSweeper** and completed daily quests

            - 🧪 Deployed agents on Polygon/Base (approx. $10 cost)

            - 🧩 Connected social accounts (GitHub, Discord, Twitter)

            - 🎲 Rolled the dice daily for random credit boosts

            - 👥 Invited friends (referral bonus = ~20%)


            Your **tier** (Bronze → Diamond) determined your multiplier. It rewarded consistency, not just one-time actions.


            # Why the 25% Bonus Matters


            If you claim and **don’t stake**, you get 100% of your tokens now.


            If you **claim and stake**, you get 100% now + **25% extra** in late August.


            To qualify:


            - You must stake immediately during the claim

            - Keep tokens staked for 30 days minimum


            You can’t un-stake early. If you do, you forfeit the bonus.


            # What’s Next for $NEWT?


            Now that the token is live, it’s expected to show up on multiple platforms. There’s no fixed price prediction
            yet, but some allocations already trade OTC between **$150–$500+** depending on tier and bonus status.


            What’s more important? The roadmap. With an **Agent Marketplace beta** slated for Q3 and additional use cases
            already planned, the token won’t sit idle.


            # 📈 Price Prediction for $NEWT


            Based on circulating supply, investor allocation, and momentum, here’s a conservative forecast:


            **Short-term (July–August 2025)**:


            - Likely trading range: **$2.50 — $4.00**

            - If >50% of users stake and lock, price may rise to **$5+**


            **Long-term (Q4 2025 and beyond)**:


            - With marketplace launch and staking demand, range could expand to **$6–8**, assuming protocol usage picks up

            Zerobase offers crypto users a chance to earn rewards through its airdrop program by staking digital assets on
            their platform. The project uses zero-knowledge proof technology to create a fast and private network for blockchain
            transactions. With backing from major investors like Binance Labs and $5 million in funding, Zerobase has attracted
            attention from the crypto community.

            **Users can participate in the Zerobase airdrop by connecting their wallet to the platform and depositing USDT
            or USDC to earn ZB points, which may convert to token rewards later.** The staking system requires a 14-day lock-up
            period but allows participants to withdraw their funds at any time. The platform supports multiple networks including
            Arbitrum, Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, and Avalanche.

            The airdrop program focuses on rewarding early users who help build the network’s total value locked through their
            deposits. Participants earn points based on their staking activity, though the final token distribution details
            have not been announced yet. Understanding how the system works and the project’s background can help users make
            informed decisions about participation.


            ## What Is Zerobase Airdrop?


            ![A group of professionals interacting with futuristic digital interfaces showing cryptocurrency tokens and blockchain
            networks in a modern office setting.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/0*uxjHpn2qR6xnnlIq)


            Zerobase operates a real-time zero-knowledge proof network backed by major investors like Binance Labs. The airdrop
            allows users to earn rewards by completing tasks and staking assets while the project develops its blockchain
            infrastructure.


            ## Overview of Zerobase


            Zerobase is a layer-1 blockchain project that uses zero-knowledge proof technology. The network focuses on creating
            fast, secure transactions for Web3 and financial applications.


            **Binance Labs** backs the project along with other major investment firms. This funding support has raised **$5
            million** in funding rounds to develop the platform.


            The project addresses key blockchain problems:


            - High transaction costs

            - Slow processing speeds

            - Privacy concerns

            - Regulatory compliance issues


            Zerobase uses a **modular Prover Network** architecture. This design allows the system to generate zero-knowledge
            proofs in hundreds of milliseconds rather than minutes or hours.


            The network targets real-time applications that need instant verification. Financial services and Web3 platforms
            can use Zerobase to process transactions quickly while maintaining privacy.


            ## Purpose of the Airdrop


            The Zerobase airdrop rewards early users who help test and promote the network. Users earn points by completing
            specific tasks during the project’s development phase.


            **Task-based rewards** form the core of the airdrop system. Participants can:


            - Stake USDT and USDC tokens

            - Complete verification steps

            - Refer new users to the platform

            - Test network features


            The airdrop currently offers **up to 45.5% APY** on staked stablecoins. Users earn both staking rewards and airdrop
            points simultaneously during the beta phase.


            Points convert to **ZB tokens** before the main network launch. The exact conversion rate has not been announced
            yet.


            This system helps Zerobase build a user base before launching its mainnet. Early participants get rewarded for
            taking risks on an unproven platform.


            ## Key Features of Zerobase


            Zerobase combines several advanced technologies to create its zero-knowledge proof network. The platform emphasizes
            speed, decentralization, and regulatory compliance.


            **Real-time ZK proofs** set Zerobase apart from competitors. Most zero-knowledge systems take minutes to generate
            proofs, but Zerobase completes them in under a second.


            The network uses **modular architecture** to achieve this speed. Different components handle specific tasks like
            proof generation, verification, and consensus.


            **Key technical features include:**


            - Sub-second proof generation

            - Cross-chain compatibility

            - Regulatory compliance tools

            - High transaction throughput

            - Privacy-preserving verification


            The platform targets institutional users who need fast, compliant blockchain solutions. Financial institutions
            can use Zerobase to verify transactions without revealing sensitive data.


            Decentralization remains a priority despite the focus on compliance. The network distributes proof generation
            across multiple nodes rather than relying on centralized servers.


            ## How to Participate in the Zerobase Airdrop


            ![A person working on a laptop and smartphone in a modern office with digital blockchain graphics on the laptop
            screen.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/0*srCNkIWcHT6DoVif)


            Participating in the Zerobase airdrop requires connecting a wallet and staking tokens through their platform.
            Users can earn ZB points by completing tasks and staking assets with a 14-day lock-up period.


            ## Eligibility Requirements


            Users must have a compatible cryptocurrency wallet to participate in the Zerobase airdrop. The platform accepts
            standard Web3 wallets like MetaMask, WalletConnect, and other popular options.


            **Basic Requirements:**


            - Active cryptocurrency wallet

            - Minimum deposit amount for staking

            - Completion of KYC verification (if required)

            - Access to supported blockchain networks


            Participants should verify their wallet compatibility before starting. The platform may implement additional verification
            steps based on regulatory requirements.


            Users must maintain their staked position for the full 14-day lock-up period. Early withdrawal may result in penalty
            fees and loss of earned points.


            ## Step-by-Step Participation Guide


            **Step 1: Connect Your Wallet**


            Visit the official Zerobase platform and click the wallet connection button. Select your preferred wallet type
            and authorize the connection.


            **Step 2: Deposit Assets**


            Choose the amount you want to stake. Start with smaller amounts due to the lock-up period and potential withdrawal
            fees.


            **Step 3: Stake Tokens**


            Confirm your deposit and begin the staking process. Your tokens will be locked for 14 days from the deposit date.


            **Step 4: Complete Tasks**


            Follow the task list provided on the platform. Complete social media activities, referrals, and other requirements
            to earn additional ZB points.


            **Step 5: Track Progress**


            Monitor your point accumulation through the dashboard. Check task completion status and upcoming requirements
            regularly.


            ## Supported Networks

            blockchain networks for deposits and withdrawals.


            **Primary Networks:**


            - Ethereum mainnet

            - Binance Smart Chain

            - Polygon

            - Additional Layer 2 solutions

            Users can deposit assets from any supported network. Cross-chain bridging may be available for unsupported tokens.


            The platform processes over 100,000 ZK proofs daily with average completion times of 200 milliseconds. Network
            fees vary based on the chosen blockchain and current congestion levels.


            ## Referral Program


            The Zerobase referral program allows users to earn additional points by inviting new participants. Each successful
            referral generates bonus rewards for both parties.


            **Referral Benefits:**


            - Extra ZB points for successful invitations

            - Percentage of referred user’s staking rewards

            - Tier-based bonus multipliers


            Users receive unique referral codes through their dashboard. Share these codes with potential participants to
            track successful referrals.


            Referred users must complete the minimum staking requirements for the referral to qualify. Both parties receive
            their bonus points after the referred user’s lock-up period begins.


            The referral system includes anti-abuse measures to prevent fake accounts and manipulation. Multiple accounts
            from the same user may result in disqualification from the program.


            ## Earning and Claiming Zerobase Airdrop Rewards


            ![A person using a laptop at a clean desk with digital cryptocurrency icons floating nearby, representing earning
            and claiming digital rewards.](https://miro.medium.com/v2/0*Xq7iP68yrKq1ECRx)


            Users earn Zerobase points through staking activities and platform engagement, with rewards distributed after
            campaign completion. The platform operates on multiple blockchain networks and requires asset deposits to begin
            earning.


            ## Farming Activities


            Participants can earn ZB points by depositing USDT or USDC into the Zerobase platform. The system supports five
            major blockchain networks for maximum accessibility.


            **Supported Networks:**


            - Ethereum (ETH)

            - BNB Chain (BNB)

            - Arbitrum (ARB)

            - Polygon (POL)

            - Avalanche (AVA)


            Users connect their EVM-compatible wallet to access the platform. After connecting, they select their preferred
            network and deposit amount.


            The platform tracks all farming activities automatically. Points accumulate based on deposit amounts and duration.
            Regular engagement with platform features increases total point earnings.


            ## Staking for Additional Benefits


            Zerobase implements a **14-day lock-up period** for staked assets. During this time, users cannot withdraw their
            deposits without potential fees.


            The TVL Team Competition launched on December 25, 2024. This feature allows users to compete for additional rewards
            through higher staking amounts.


            **Key Staking Details:**


            - Minimum lock period: 14 days

            - Supported assets: USDT and USDC

            - Withdrawal fees may apply

            - Points earned throughout lock period


            Users should start with smaller amounts due to withdrawal restrictions. The platform recommends testing the system
            before making larger deposits.


            ## Claim Process


            Zerobase distributes airdrop rewards after the campaign ends. Users must accumulate sufficient points during the
            active period to qualify for rewards.


            The platform has not announced specific claiming dates or token amounts. Participants need to monitor official
            announcements for distribution schedules.


            **Claiming Requirements:**


            - Active participation during campaign

            - Minimum point threshold (not specified)

            - Completed KYC if required

            - Valid wallet connection


            Users can track their point balance through the platform dashboard. The system updates point totals in real-time
            as users complete activities.


            ## Project Background and Token Details


            Zerobase secured $5 million in funding from major investors including Binance Labs and dao5. The project’s tokenomics
            are still under development as it remains in early stages.


            ## Funding and Investors


            Zerobase raised **$5 million** in its completed funding round. The investment came from prominent blockchain investors.


            **Binance Labs** led the funding round as the primary investor. This backing provides significant credibility
            to the project.


            **dao5** also participated as a key investor in the funding round. The combination of these institutional investors
            demonstrates strong confidence in the project’s potential.


            The Binance Labs backing is particularly noteworthy. This investment arm has a track record of supporting successful
            blockchain projects.


            The funding positions Zerobase to develop its zero-knowledge proof infrastructure. The capital will support technical
            development and team expansion.


            ## Tokenomics


            Zerobase’s token economic model remains **under development**. The project has not yet released detailed information
            about token distribution or supply.


            Current token price stands at **$0** as the token has not launched publicly. Market capitalization data is not
            available at this stage.


            The project plans to conduct an airdrop for early participants. Specific details about token allocation for the
            airdrop have not been announced.


            Token utility will likely center around the zero-knowledge proof network. Users may need tokens to pay for proof
            generation services.


            Staking mechanisms appear to be part of the planned tokenomics. Early participants can stake assets to earn potential
            airdrop rewards.


            ## Future Roadmap


            Zerobase aims to become the leading **ZK prover network** for speed and security. The project focuses on real-time
            proof generation capabilities.


            The network targets proof generation within **hundreds of milliseconds**. This speed would enable large-scale
            commercial applications.


            Regulatory compliance remains a key development focus. The project works to balance privacy protection with regulatory
            requirements.


            The **HUB ring-wake mechanism** will enable decentralized consensus. This technology supports the network’s scalability
            goals.


            Future development includes building infrastructure for privacy-preserving applications. The project targets cost-effective
            and accessible proof generation for widespread adoption.


            ## Frequently Asked Questions


            Participating in the Zerobase Airdrop requires completing specific tasks and meeting eligibility requirements.
            Users can stake tokens through the platform’s system, but they should be aware of lock-up periods and potential
            withdrawal fees.


            ## How can I participate in the Zerobase Airdrop?


            Users must complete designated tasks to qualify for potential Zerobase airdrops and rewards. The platform provides
            step-by-step instructions that participants can follow to track their progress.


            Participants need to connect their compatible wallet to the Zerobase platform. They should then complete the required
            activities as outlined in the official airdrop guide.


            The system tracks task updates and completion status automatically. Users can monitor their progress through the
            platform’s interface to ensure they meet all requirements.


            ## What are the eligibility requirements to receive the Zerobase Airdrop?


            Eligibility depends on completing specific tasks outlined by the Zerobase team. Users must follow the official
            requirements and maintain active participation in the platform’s activities.


            Participants need to have a compatible cryptocurrency wallet connected to the platform. They must also complete
            any verification steps required by the project.


            The project may update eligibility requirements at any time. Users should regularly check the official channels
            for the most current information about qualification criteria.


            ## Is there a deadline to claim the Zerobase Airdrop?


            The exact deadline for claiming the Zerobase Airdrop has not been announced. The reward date is currently listed
            as “to be determined” by the project team.


            Previous beta launch periods have had specific timeframes. For example, one beta launch ran from December 26,
            2024, to January 13, 2025.


            Users should monitor official announcements for updates on claim deadlines. The project may announce specific
            timeframes closer to the distribution date.


            ## What steps should I take if I encounter issues with the Zerobase Airdrop?


            Users experiencing technical difficulties should first check their wallet connection and ensure it is properly
            linked to the platform. They should verify that all required tasks have been completed according to the instructions.


            If problems persist, participants should contact the official Zerobase support team through verified channels.
            Users should avoid clicking on suspicious links or sharing private keys with unauthorized parties.


            Documentation of completed tasks can help resolve disputes. Users should keep records of their participation and
            any confirmation messages received from the platform.


            ## Can I stake my tokens to qualify for the Zerobase Airdrop?


            Zerobase offers token farming through its staking system to help users qualify for potential rewards. The staking
            program includes a 14-day lock-up period for participants.


            Users should start with smaller amounts due to the lock-up requirements and possible withdrawal fees. The staking
            system allows participants to earn points toward potential airdrop eligibility.


            Staked tokens cannot be withdrawn during the lock-up period. Participants should consider this restriction before
            committing funds to the staking program.


            ## How is the distribution of the Zerobase Airdrop calculated?


            The exact calculation method for Zerobase Airdrop distribution has not been publicly disclosed. The project uses
            a points-based system to track user participation and activity.


            Points are earned through completing various tasks and activities on the platform. The final distribution amount
            may depend on the total number of points accumulated by each participant.


            The project reserves the right to change distribution details at any time. This includes the number of tokens
            distributed, the schedule, and the specific reward calculations used.

          Projects like **zkSync** and **Polygon Zero** are leveraging zero-knowledge proofs to enhance the scalability of
          Ethereum without compromising decentralization. Using ZK-rollups, these platforms bundle thousands of off-chain
          transactions, compute a validity proof, and then publish a single, succinct proof back to the main chain. This approach
          allows for faster transaction speeds, lower gas fees, and improved user privacy, as the proof confirms transaction
          legitimacy without revealing specific details.

          **Polygon zkEVM''s Role in Zero-Knowledge Proof Ecosystems**


          **Polygon zkEVM** is an integral part of the zero-knowledge proof ecosystem, with platforms like OFUYC integrating
          with it to launch institutional settlement APIs for zkEVM trading environments by 2026. The Ethereum zkEVM initiative
          aims to replace execution with proofs, using mathematics to guarantee on-chain correctness without requiring validators
          to repeat work. This shift enables audits to verify risk states instantly through structured ZK proof interfaces.
          Additionally, the Poseidon hash function, a rising star in zero-knowledge proofs, is already being used in Layer
          2 solutions like **Polygon''s zkEVM** to achieve faster and more efficient cryptographic operations, aiming for
          cheaper gas fees and snappier rollups.

          **Development of ZK Rollup Solutions on zkSync and Polygon**


          Developing ZK Rollup solutions on platforms like **zkSync** and **Polygon CDK** offers ready-to-go frameworks that
          significantly reduce development time and costs. These open-source options allow developers to concentrate on unique
          features rather than foundational cryptographic infrastructure. **zkSync** specifically provides faster finality
          through zero-knowledge proofs, emphasizing user-friendly interfaces and high performance, making it suitable for
          NFT platforms, games, and fast-paced dApps.

          **zkSync and Polygon as ZK Rollup Examples for Ethereum Scaling**


          **zkSync** is explicitly mentioned as an example of a ZK Rollup, a type of Layer 2 solution that utilizes zero-knowledge
          cryptography to prove transaction validity. These Layer 2s are built on top of Ethereum to offload computation and
          data storage, allowing for cheaper and faster interactions while maintaining Ethereum''s security. **Polygon** is
          also listed as an EVM-compatible Layer 1 chain, and its zkEVM is noted for making waves in the ZKP space, contributing
          to Ethereum''s scalability.
