        processed_summary: '**Ethereum''s scalability limitations have led to the development of Layer 2 (L2) scaling solutions**,
          which are fundamentally changing the blockchain ecosystem''s architecture. These solutions aim to **improve transaction
          throughput and reduce costs** but also introduce new security challenges like data availability problems, fraud
          proof limitations, and cross-layer attack surfaces. Major L2 scaling approaches include **optimistic rollups, zero-knowledge
          rollups, state channels, and sidechains**. ["Ethereum Layer 2 Scaling Solutions: A Comprehensive Security Analysis
          of Contemporary Approaches" https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5395177 August 27, 2025]


          **Rollups are emphasized as the core scaling solution for Ethereum**, batching transactions off-chain and settling
          them to the mainnet. **Arbitrum and Optimism are prominent Layer 2 rollups** that offer faster, cheaper activity
          compared to the Ethereum mainnet. These two together now **process more daily transactions than Ethereum mainnet**.
          The **EIP-4844 "blob fee" change, implemented in early 2024, introduced "blob space," making it significantly cheaper
          for rollups to publish transaction data to Ethereum**. This resulted in **average fees on rollups falling sharply
          to just a few cents**, enabling more high-frequency activities. However, this shift to rollups and the lower pricing
          of blob space have **reduced ETH burn rates, slowing Ethereum’s post-Merge deflationary momentum**. This creates
          a trade-off: **more affordable transactions at the cost of weaker deflationary pressure**. Future upgrades, including
          full danksharding, are expected to further expand blob capacity and reduce costs. ["Scaling at a Cost: Cheaper Transactions,

          **Scroll (SCR) is an Ethereum Layer 2 scaling solution utilizing zero-knowledge rollup (zkRollup) technology** to
          enhance transaction speed and reduce costs while maintaining Ethereum’s security. It processes transactions off-chain
          using **zkEVM for seamless compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts**. Scroll aims to **reduce congestion and
          gas fees by up to 90%** by bundling transactions off-chain and generating cryptographic proofs (zk-proofs) for validation
          on Ethereum. Unlike optimistic rollups, **zkRollups provide near-instant finality** by submitting validity proofs
          to Ethereum, minimizing withdrawal delays. Scroll focuses on real-world adoption, supporting use cases like enterprise
          crypto treasuries and gasless payments. ["What Is Scroll (SCR) And How Does It Work?" https://coinmarketcap.com/cmc-ai/scroll/what-is/

          to a potential further decline in bitcoin prices." "Bitcoin’s (BTC) slide into September comes with an uncomfortable
          reminder for traders that history is not on their side." "The largest token by market capitalization has declined
          in nine of the last 14 September months, with an average monthly loss of around 12%." "This seasonality looms large
          again in 2025. Bitcoin opened the week near $110,000, its weakest level in nearly two months, and total crypto market
          capitalization has slipped to $3.74 trillion, reaching a three-week low." "BTC prices have been flat over the past
          24 hours, with Solana’s SOL (SOL) leading gains at 4%, XRP [XRP$2.8545] posting 1% and Cardano’s ADA (ADA) rising
          1.5%." "Alex Kuptsikevich, chief market analyst at FxPro, noted that the broader capitalization chart “continues
          to record a series of lower lows, signaling a downward trend.”" "He pointed to Bitcoin’s failure to hold $112,000
          and warned of “further decline toward the $105,000 area,” a level that has long acted as support before the psychological
          $100,000 barrier." "The crypto fear index has slipped back toward 40, its lowest since April, suggesting nerves
          are rising before they’ve fully broken." "In 2017, bitcoin dropped nearly 8% in September despite the euphoric rally
          that carried it to $20,000 later that year." "In 2019, the token lost almost 14% in September, foreshadowing months
          of sideways action." "Even in the latest cycle, September 2021 and 2022 both saw steep drawdowns, reminding traders
          that liquidity drains and macro jitters often coincide with the end of summer." "This year, those headwinds are
          visible in ETF flows. After steady accumulation through much of August, spot bitcoin ETFs in the U.S. recorded net
          outflows of $440 million last week." "Ether ETFs, which launched just last year, posted more than $1 billion in
          inflows, marking a rare bright spot but also a sign that capital may be rotating rather than growing overall." "Meanwhile,
          CryptoQuant data shows spot ETFs have now absorbed more than 1.3 million BTC, nearly 6% of total supply, putting
          them on par with the largest exchanges for market share." "The risk is that support levels break before macro relief
          arrives. Non-farm payrolls due Friday are expected to show just 45,000 new jobs, confirming a slowing U.S. labor
          market." "A soft print would strengthen the case for a September rate cut from the Fed, a catalyst that could flip
          sentiment back to risk-on. Until then, traders are paying up for downside hedges." "Options data shows the strongest
          demand for puts in weeks, with skew leaning firmly bearish, FxPro’s Kuptsikevich noted, calling for caution among
          intra-day traders." (https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2025/09/03/bitcoin-traders-warn-of-12-monthly-drop-as-solana-leads-majors-gains)

          **Bitcoin Headed to $190K on Institutional Wave, Research Firm Says**: "Tiger Research predicts bitcoin could reach
          $190,000 by Q3, driven by global liquidity, ETF demand, and new 401(k) access." "The report highlights a potential
          $90 billion demand from 401(k) allocations and significant institutional accumulation." "Despite bullish forecasts,
          on-chain indicators suggest caution, with metrics showing a market that is active but not overheated." "Asia-focused
          Tiger Research has set a Q3 price target of $190,000 for bitcoin [BTC$109,153.72], arguing that record global liquidity,
          structural ETF demand, and new 401(k) access give the market its strongest setup since 2021." "Tiger’s model pegs
          a “base price” of $135,000, then layers on multipliers for fundamentals (+3.5%) and macro conditions (+35%) to reach
          the $190,000 forecast — giving a 67% from this week’s average $113,000." "The report relies on three key drivers.
          The M2 money supply exceeding $90 trillion, ETF and corporate accumulation now accounting for 6% of bitcoin’s supply,
          and a regulatory green light that has opened U.S. retirement accounts to crypto." "Trump’s executive order allowing
          401(k) exposure adds what Tiger calls “a definitive signal of bitcoin’s transition to a core institutional holding.”"
          "Even a 1% allocation from the $8.9 trillion pool would equal nearly $90 billion of demand." "Accumulation is visible.
          ETFs collectively hold 1.3 million BTC, while Strategy (MSTR) owns more than 629,000 coins, worth $71 billion."
          "Buying through convertible bonds has given Strategy’s flows a structural quality." "Transfer volumes also skew
          larger, with fewer transactions but bigger sizes, reflecting a pivot from retail traffic to institutional block
          activity." "Still, the report admits the network looks unbalanced. Daily transactions and active users remain well
          below last year’s highs, and retail participation has faded." "New initiatives like BTCFi are needed to re-ignite
          activity beyond institutional wallets." "On-chain gauges also flash caution. MVRV-Z, which tracks how far market
          price has stretched above what holders originally paid, sits at 2.49 — a zone that in past cycles has preceded corrections
          as profits build up." "Adjusted spent output profit ratio (ASOPR) is at 1.019, meaning coins being sold are only
          slightly in profit, suggesting traders are locking in modest gains rather than cashing out at extremes." "Net Unrealized
          Profit/Loss (NUPL), a measure of unrealized profit and loss across the network, stands at 0.558, indicating a healthy
          but not yet euphoric positioning. Taken together, the data suggest a market that’s hot but not yet overexposed."

          **The community sentiment voted Ethereum bullish (82%) as of 28 August 2025**. This positive sentiment followed
          ETH''s dramatic rise from $1,567 in April 2025 to over $4,000 in early August, supported by a rising 200-day moving
          average. **Forecasts indicate that Ethereum is likely to reach $5,000 before the end of 2025 if its strong bullish
          trend continues**. For 2025, the **Ethereum price prediction places it at a peak of $5,124 by November**, with strong
          performance expected in the last quarter. **If ETH maintains a bullish trend in 2026, it could reach $7,000 within
          months**, a significant milestone that could accelerate its trend towards $10,000. **Forecasts for 2030 suggest
          ETH will hover around $12,000**, with an expected investment shift towards Ethereum in the last quarter of that
          year.

          **Ethereum (ETH) price is currently trading near $4,400, driven by increased "whale" accumulation and rising global
          liquidity, drawing comparisons to its significant 2017 breakout rally**. Many analysts believe Ethereum could be
          on the verge of a **"parabolic move" towards $15,000 if it decisively clears the $5,000 resistance level**. Crypto
          strategist @EtherNasyonaL noted that "Ethereum is mirroring the consolidation and breakout structure from 2017,
          suggesting a 3x move could follow if $5,000 is breached," leading to speculation that **ETH could climb to the $12,000–$15,000
          range by mid-2026**. **Finder’s expert panel projects ETH at $6,100 by the end of 2025**, while Wallet Investor
          maintains a **long-term target near $7,000**. Longer-range estimates point to **potential highs of $12,000 by 2030**.

          **Spot Ethereum ETFs were a primary driver of ETH''s bullish trend in 2025**, allowing large financial institutions
          exposure without direct ownership. **Whales have also acquired over $450 million in Ethereum, dumping Bitcoin**,
          which has contributed to Ethereum''s upward trend. Ethereum is often seen as a leader for other altcoins during
          a bullish cycle.

              The Ethereum Foundation (EF) exists to strengthen Ethereum’s ecosystem and uphold its long-standing non-negotiable
              objectives: enabling "applications that run exactly as programmed without any possibility of downtime, censorship,
              fraud, or third-party interference". EF Treasury supports EF''s long-term agency, sustainability, and legitimacy.
              Capital deployments should be balanced between seeking returns above a benchmark rate and extending EF''s role
              as a steward of the Ethereum ecosystem, with a'

            text: "# [blog](https://ethereum.github.io/blog/)\n\n# blog.ethereum.org\n\nThis is the repository for [blog.ethereum.org](https://blog.ethereum.org),\
              \ which includes the codebase for the website as well as all blog post entries. A blog editor (currently Joseph\
              \ Schweitzer) is required to approve draft posts and merge them into the `master` branch to be published on\
              \ the live site. Once PRs are merged into `master`, changes are automatically deployed to the site via our Netlify\
              \ integration.\n\nIf these instructions are confusing to you or you’d rather just submit your blog directly\
              \ to a blog editor instead of this repository, please reach out to the current editors.\n\n## Current blog editors\n\
              \n- **Joseph Schweitzer**, @Joseph in the EF Discord or joe@ethereum.org\n\n## Features\n\nPosts must to be\
              \ written in [Markdown format](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). If you are unfamiliar\
              \ with Markdown, see the **Useful Markdown Links** section at the bottom.\n\nYou have the ability to embed images,\
              \ YouTube videos, Twitter posts, code snippets, and GitHub gists into your blogs.\n\n### Adding a Table of Contents\n\
              \nThis is an optional, opt-in feature, that allows you to add a **Table of Contents (ToC)** at the top of a\
              \ post. Take into account that ToCs are generated using h2 subheadings and lower, so you’ll need at least one\
              \ of those in the post content.\n\nYou can enable the ToC for a specific post, by adding the optional `toc:\
              \ true` prop on the frontmatter data, e.g.:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: 'A post about the future of Ethereum.org'\n\
              date: 2023-08-31\nauthor: Ethereum.org Team\ncategory: Ethereum.org\nimage: https://storage.googleapis.com/ethereum-hackmd/upload_fc8f505659849ac7e21c75d47f833bbe.png\n\
              toc: true\n---\n\n```\n\nIn case you don’t want to add the ToC, just skip adding this line.\n\n> **NOTE:** You\
              \ also have to add the line `toc: true` on the translated markdown files, as this is an opt-in, per file feature.\n\
              \n### Embed an image\n\n![alt text](https://ethereum.github.io/blog/public/images/readme/doge.jpg)\n\n- If you\
              \ have an external link to an image, you can use that here.\n- If you have images you’d like to upload:\n -\
              \ You can place these images in the `/public/images/posts` and commit these as part of your pull request (PR).\n\
              \ - To display, reference the image using the path `/images/posts/image-file-name` (without `/public`)\n\n```\n\
              ![alt text](/images/readme/doge.jpg)\n\n```\n\nIf this step if confusing you can just send a blog editor the\
              \ pictures and let them know where you want them in the blog, or paste the images in the message of your PR\
              \ on GitHub.\n\n### Embed YouTube clips\n\nPaste the following into your blog entry, replacing T5RcjYPTG9g with\
              \ the video ID found in the video URL.\n\n```\n \n\n```\n\n### Embed Twitter posts\n\nNavigate to the Twitter\
              \ post you want to embed. Click on the arrow in the top-right corner of the tweet and click `Embed Tweet`. Copy\
              \ the code and paste it into your blog.\n\n### Create a code snippet\n\nYou can highlight a code snippet by\
              \ wrapping code segments in triple-backticks (\\`\\`\\`). Place these backticks in their own lines.\n\n\\`\\\
              `\\`\n\n```\ndef foo\n\n puts 'foo'\n\nend\n\n```\n\n\\`\\`\\`\n\n### LaTeX\n\nThe site uses [KaTeX](https://katex.org)\
              \ to render LaTeX/math expressions. LaTeX-rendering libs are not 100% compatible with LaTex yet, so please check\
              \ the [support table](https://katex.org/docs/support_table.html) if you are having issues with some expression.\n\
              \n### Future posts\n\nYou can create a post with a date in the future (remember the date in your filename and\
              \ frontmatter data should match) that will not be included in the build and will remain hidden up to this defined\
              \ date. This is useful if you want to ‘schedule’ posts to save time in advance.\n\ne.g., a post with the following\
              \ date:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: 'A post about the future of Ethereum.org'\ndate: 2023-08-31\nauthor: Ethereum.org\
              \ Team\ncategory: Ethereum.org\nimage: https://storage.googleapis.com/ethereum-hackmd/upload_fc8f505659849ac7e21c75d47f833bbe.png\n\
              ---\n\n```\n\nwill not appear on the blog until `2023-08-31`.\n\n### Code snippets syntax highlighting\n\nThe\
              \ blog has syntax highlighting support for\n\n- `bash`\n- `javascript`\n- `json`\n- `python`\n- `typescript`\n\
              - `solidity`\n\nTo keep the build size light, we are supporting these languages only for now as they were used\
              \ previously on the blog. More languages can be added in the future if required.\n\nTo make use of this feature,\
              \ we need to specify the language on the snippet (using markdown syntax), e.g. with a typescript snippet, add\
              \ `typescript` next to the opening backticks:\n\n````\n```typescript\nimport VM from '@ethereumjs/vm';\nimport\
              \ Common from '@ethereumjs/common';\n\nconst common = new Common({ chain: 'mainnet', hardfork: 'spuriousDragon'\
              \ });\nconst vm = new VM({ common });\n\n````\n\nOtherwise, it will use `bash` as default.\n\n### Content images\
              \ centered automatically\n\nYou don’t need to add any extra tag to center images from the post content, just\
              \ add the image tag using Markdown syntax: `![image-alt-text](image-url)`.\n\n### Internal blog links\n\nTo\
              \ reference other blog posts in the content, you don’t need to use the full URL. You should just use the _relative\
              \ URL_, e.g.:\n\n`https://blog.ethereum.org/2022/08/24/mainnet-merge-announcement` should be written as simply\
              \ `/2022/08/24/mainnet-merge-announcement`, without the _https://blog.ethereum.org_ prefix.\n\n### Multi-language\
              \ search\n\nPreviously, search was available in English only, for English content. Now, depending on your selected\
              \ language, you can look for posts using the [search page](https://blog.ethereum.org/search) in different languages,\
              \ e.g.: use Spanish if you’re on the [Spanish version of the search page](https://blog.ethereum.org/es/search).\n\
              \n## Post filename convention\n\nTo avoid any issue and follow a certain standard, filename should be in the\
              \ following format: `YYYY-MM-DD-title-here.md`, e.g. `2015-07-30-awesome-new-blog-post.md`\n\nSpecial characters\
              \ such as hash signs, ampersands, or question marks should be removed from the title, and it should be kept\
              \ in “kebab” casing (all lowercase, with words separated by hyphens). Avoid using capital letters.\n\n## How\
              \ to submit a blog post\n\nPlease contact an editor listed above before starting if you would like to list your\
              \ blog post.\n\n### Creating a post\n\nCreate a `.md` document in the `src/posts/en` folder with a naming convention\
              \ and frontmatter content (title, subtitle, date, author, image, category) similar to blog entries in the `src/posts/en`\
              \ folder (see examples below).\n\n**Translation note:** Original English posts should be placed in the above\
              \ folder ( `/src/posts/en`). Translated versions of this post will be placed in their corresponding language\
              \ folder, ie: `/src/posts/es/` for Spanish. See below for more information regarding internationalization.\n\
              \nYou can create a new file by navigating to the `src/posts/en` folder above and clicking `Add file` then `Create\
              \ new file`.\n\n![GitHub create new file screenshot](https://ethereum.github.io/blog/public/images/readme/github-1-create-new-file.png)\n\
              \nRemember that filename should follow the [naming convention](https://ethereum.github.io/blog/#post-filename-convention).\n\
              \n![GitHub file naming screenshot](https://ethereum.github.io/blog/public/images/readme/github-2-name-file.png)\n\
              \n## Starting the post\n\nThe beginning of the post should start with metadata about the post in the following\
              \ format:\n\n```\n---\ntitle: 'Awesomenewblogpost!'\nsubtitle: 'Subtitleordescription(optionalline)'\ndate:\
              \ 2015-07-30\nauthor: Your Name\ncategory: Category Name\nsubcategory: Optional Subcategory Name\nimage: /images/posts/2015/07/my-banner.png\n\
              ---\n\n```\n\nThe `title` here will be used as the main header ( `h1`) of the page. Avoid using any other `h1`\
              \ headers in the post (a line starting with a single `#` in markdown) and start using `h2` ( `##` in markdown)\
              \ directly in the content when needed.\n\nThe `subtitle` field is optional. If you chose not to include one,\
              \ remove this entire line.\n\nThe `date` field must match the date being used in the filename.\n\nThe `category`\
              \ field must match one of the existing category names ( _otherwise the building process will fail_):\n\n- Research\
              \ & Development\n- Events\n- Organizational\n- Ecosystem Support Program\n- Ethereum.org\n- Security\n- Next\
              \ Billion\n- Protocol Announcements\n\nThe `subcategory` field is optional and does not appear anywhere on posts.\
              \ It is only visible in the RSS feed. Currently this field is only used to differentiate Devcon posts from Devconnect\
              \ posts under the “Events” category. When making a post with the “Events” category, please specify one of the\
              \ following subcategories:\n\n- Devcon\n- Devconnect\n\nThe `image` field should be the path to the image (\
              \ `/images/posts/[image-name]`) you want to use as the banner for the post. If you have an external link to\
              \ an image, you can use that here. If you have an image you’d like to upload, you can either include this as\
              \ a commit to your pull request (PR), or simply paste it in the message of the PR on GitHub and request assistance.\
              \ The `image` is not a required, but encouraged. In case you don’t want to provide an image path, remove this\
              \ line and a default image will be used for the post header section.\n\n**Images from the post content are centered\
              \ automatically**, so please don’t include any ` ` tag to center them and reduce the clutter.\n\n> **NOTE:**\
              \ `layout` and `published` fields are not used anymore, you don’t have to include them.\n\nThe rest of your\
              \ post can be entered beneath this section.\n\n![GitHub front matter and initial post templating screenshot](https://ethereum.github.io/blog/public/images/readme/github-3-frontmatter.png)\n\
              \nAdditionally please look at other blog posts in the `src/posts/en` folder to make sure you are doing it correctly.\n\
              \n### Submitting a pull request (PR)\n\n## Publishing your blog post\n\nOnce your post from above is ready,\
              \ you can submit a pull request (PR) to the `master` branch at the bottom of the edit page on GitHub.\n\n![GitHub\
              \ PR submission screenshot](https://ethereum.github.io/blog/public/images/readme/github-4-pr-submission.png)\n\
              \nNext, contact a blog editor (above) who will look over the post to make sure it is formatted correctly. Once\
              \ it is approved it will be merged into the `master` branch where it will be broadcast live to the interwebz.\
              \ Only blog editors can push blog entries to that branch. It can take up to ten minutes for the blog post to\
              \ propagate and display on [blog.ethereum.org](https://ethereum.github.io/blog/blog.ethereum.org). If you let\
              \ Joseph Schweitzer know ahead of time we can post a link to your blog on the official @ethereum Twitter, LinkedIn,\
              \ Facebook, and /r/ethereum subreddit.\n\n## Useful Markdown links\n\n- [Markdown GitHub Page](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)\n\

              \ Editor (useful for creating tables)](https://hackmd.io/)\n\n## Translations\n\nAs the blog now supports internationalization,\
              \ authors can order translations for new and upcoming blog posts, and suggest older posts that should be translated.\n\
              \n### New and upcoming blog posts\n\nIf you are in the process of drafting a blog post or have recently published\
              \ one, we can order translations from Acolad, our language service provider.\n\nAll new English posts should\
              \ be placed in the `src/posts/en` folder, where they can subsequently be sent for translation upon request.\
              \ For reference, note that all of these translated files will maintain the same filename as the original English\
              \ post, but will be placed in a folder with the language code (e.g. `src/posts/zh` for Chinese).\n\nThe majority\
              \ of posts on the EF blog are most popular in the few days following their publication and become less relevant\
              \ and accurate as time goes by. Therefore, publishing translations as soon as possible ensures that the majority\
              \ of visitors can read them in their native language and allows for maximum accessibility. The best way to achieve\
              \ this is using Acolad, as we can set deadlines and expedite certain translations.\n\nIn case you want to request\
              \ translations for a new or upcoming blog post, you can fill out [this form](https://ef-blog-translations.paperform.co/)\
              \ and the translation program team will process the order as soon as possible.\n\n### Old or existing blog posts\n\
              \nIn addition to translating new posts, we upload some older posts that are still relevant, popular, or have\
              \ some historical significance, to Crowdin (the localization tool that we use) and allow our community of translators\
              \ to translate them at their own pace.\n\nIf you have written a blog post in the past and would like to get\
              \ it translated, please fill out [this form](https://ef-blog-translations.paperform.co/) and the translation\
              \ program team will process the order as soon as possible.\n\nSince these posts will be translated by the community,\
              \ we do not have much influence on the timelines for translation. Community-translated posts will be updated\
              \ on the blog periodically.\n\nIn case you receive questions from people wanting to translate a blog post or\
              \ get involved with the translation process, please direct them to our [EF blog translation guide](https://ethereum.org/en/contributing/translation-program/blog-translations/).\n\
              \n## Updating blog posts\n\nIf you’re looking to update a post that is NOT translated, simply open a PR with\
              \ your suggested changes.\n\nUpdating translated posts is not as straightforward, so there is an additional\
              \ step in the update process:\n\n- If you are only updating links, images, or numbers (e.g. version numbers)\
              \ in a post, feel free to change this content in all languages the post has been translated into in the same\
              \ PR.\n\n- In case of changes to the source text, please let Luka know by tagging @lukassim in the PR on GitHub,\
              \ sending a message with a link to the PR in the `#website-blog` channel on the EF Discord, or sending an email\
              \ to translations@ethereum.org.\n\n\nBased on the importance, urgency, and scope of the changes, we will either\
              \ order translations for the updated content from Acolad, or ask the community for help. We may also choose\
              \ to translate content using machine translations as a temporary solution until human translations are completed.\n\
              \n## Tech Stack\n\nThe main stack used in the project includes:\n\n- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).\n- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).\n\
              - [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/) as component library.\n- [React Markdown + plugins](https://remarkjs.github.io/react-markdown/)\
              \ for Markdown support.\n- [`react-intl`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/) for i18n support.\n- [Algolia\
              \ Search Engine](https://www.algolia.com/) for the Search feature.\n- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)\
              \ for animations.\n- [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for linting and code\
              \ formatting.\n- [`feed`](https://github.com/jpmonette/feed) for RSS support.\n- [`next-sitemap`](https://github.com/iamvishnusankar/next-sitemap)\
              \ to generate sitemap.\n- [KaTeX](https://katex.org/) to render LaTeX math syntax.\n\n### Local development\n\
              \nThis is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).\n\
              \n#### Getting Started\n\nFirst, clone the repository:\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/ethereum/blog.git\n\
              cd blog\nyarn\n\n```\n\nInstall dependencies:\n\n```\nyarn\n\n```\n\nRun the development server:\n\n```\nyarn\
              \ dev\n\n```\n\nOpen [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.\n\n\
              #### `react-intl`, TypeScript & `eslint` setup\n\nWhen using `react-intl` together with TypeScript, `id` prop\
              \ is mandatory for [`FormattedMessage`](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/components/#formattedmessage) component\
              \ to avoid compiler issues on strict mode. A way to fix this is setting up an `eslint` rule to trigger an error,\
              \ which you can find on `.eslintrc.json` to enforce the id generation based on the string content. Then you’ll\
              \ be able to generate the proper id by using the TypeScript quick-fix tools.\n\n```\n\"rules\": {\n \"formatjs/enforce-id\"\
              : [\n \"error\",\n {\n \"idInterpolationPattern\": \"[sha512:contenthash:base64:6]\"\n }\n ]\n}\n\n```\n\n###\

              # lean Ethereum


              ## Posted by Justin Drake on July 31, 2025


              [Research & Development](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/research-and-development)


              Yesterday Ethereum turned 10. Today, _lean Ethereum_ is unveiled as a vision—and personal mission—for the next
              10 years.


              We stand at the dawn of a new era. Millions of TPS. Quantum adversaries. How does Ethereum marry extreme performance
              with uncompromising security and decentralization?


              **TLDR**: next-generation cryptography is central to winning both offense and defense.


              _Disclaimer: This is a Drake take™ aimed at a broad audience. A technical deep dive into hash-based post-quantum
              signatures and SNARKs will follow. A healthy diversity of views across Protocol, the EF, and the broader Ethereum
              community is expected and welcome. It strengthens us._


              ## defense—fort mode


              Ethereum is special. [100% uptime](https://ethereumuptime.org) since genesis. Unrivaled client diversity. **130B
              USD in economic security** (35.7M ETH staked × 3.7K USD)—maybe soon 1T USD.


              Ethereum is poised to become the bedrock of **the internet of value**, securing hundreds of trillions over decades,
              even centuries.


              Ethereum must survive anything: nation states, quantum computers. Whatever comes. Call it _fort mode_. If the
              internet is up, Ethereum is up. **If the world is online, the world is onchain.**


              ## offense—beast mode


              Ethereum is hungry. "Scale L1, scale blobs" is a strategic urgency inside the EF''s Protocol cluster. Expect
              low-hanging performance gains over the next 6–12 months.


              Longer term? Think gigagas L1, teragas L2. Call it _beast mode_.


              - **1 gigagas/sec on L1**: 10K TPS, ambitious vertical scale

              - **1 teragas/sec on L2**: 10M TPS, sprawling horizontal scale


              Scale vs decentralization? Why not both. The moon math we need is now tamed:


              - **real-time zkVMs** for lean execution

              - **data availability sampling** (DAS) for lean data


              A delicious cherry on top: full chain verification across every browser, wallet, phone.


              ## lean upgrades


              Lean Ethereum proposes bold upgrades across all three L1 sublayers:


              - **lean consensus** is _beacon chain 2.0:_ hardened for ultimate security and decentralization, plus finality
              in seconds; formerly branded as "beam chain"

              - **lean data** is _blobs 2.0:_ post-quantum blobs, plus granular blob sizing for a calldata-like developer
              experience

              - **lean execution** is _EVM 2.0:_ a minimal, SNARK-friendly instruction set (possibly RISC-V; pronounced "risk
              five"), boosting performance while preserving EVM compatibility and its network effects


              The consensus layer (CL), data layer (DL), execution layer (EL) have each been reimagined from first principles.
              Together, they unlock fort mode and beast mode.


              **The goal:** performance abundance under the constraint of non-negotiable continuity, maximum hardness, and
              refreshing simplicity.


              ## lean cryptography


              Hash-based cryptography is emerging as the ideal foundation for lean Ethereum. It offers a compelling, unified
              answer to two megatrends reshaping the ecosystem:


              - the explosive **rise of SNARKs**

              - the looming **quantum threat**


              Imagine the leanest cryptographic brick—the hash function—singlehandedly powering L1:


              - **CL**: _hash-based aggregate signatures_ upgrade BLS signatures

              - **DL**: _hash-based DAS commitments_ upgrade KZG commitments

              - **EL**: _hash-based real-time zkVMs_ upgrade EVM re-execution


              A cryptographic jewel in each of lean CL, lean DL, lean EL.


              ## lean craft


              Lean Ethereum is more than a blueprint for hardening and scaling Ethereum. More than just doubling down on security,
              decentralisation, and cutting-edge cryptography. It is an aesthetic. An art form. A craft. Think Jiro in _Dreams
              of Sushi_. When we can go the extra mile, we do.


              Minimalism. Modularity. Encapsulated complexity. Formal verification. Provable security. Provable optimality.
              These are subtle yet important technical considerations. Stay tuned for the post on post-quantum cryptography
              that will make them explicit.


              ## lean legacy


              After 10 fantastic years, lean Ethereum is a generational oath. To keep Ethereum online no matter what. To scale
              it without compromise. To make it worthy of those who come next.


              This is about legacy. We are builders, we are missionaries. We are Ethereum. I hope you **join us**.

              # Announcing Protocol


              ## Posted by Barnabé Monnot, Tim Beiko, Alex Stokes on June 2, 2025


              [Organizational](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/organizational)


              Ethereum stands at the edge of major breakthroughs. zkEVMs have rapidly accelerated, enabling us to rearchitect
              L1 to simultaneously support scale, verifiability, security and censorship-resistance. L2s are hardening, meeting
              users where they are, and eager to double down on using Ethereum as their root of trust. In short, the world
              is ready for the world computer.


              These significant innovations both unlock massive benefits for our users and will allow us to onboard many,
              many more. The stakes are high: This moment may be Ethereum’s best shot at deploying not only our technology,
              but our values, at planetary scale.


              As a response, we must rethink our current approach to designing, developing and stewarding the protocol. This
              process of “shipping protocol” is messy, asking us to respond proactively to demands that are hard to articulate
              and even harder to fulfill. It is our responsibility to use our skills to benefit the broader community.


              Executing on this mandate will require a new level of focus and collaboration for our group, the Protocol Research
              & Development teams within the EF. This means doubling down on areas where the EF has unique domain knowledge
              and deep expertise unmatched in our ecosystem: from writing mission-critical code, to publishing breakthrough
              research and coordinating large initiatives.


              To support this vision, we are making changes to the way that we operate, re-orienting towards our [three strategic
              goals](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/04/28/next-chapter): scaling the L1, scaling the blobs, and improving
              UX. Practically, this means restructuring our teams and creating explicit coordination structures around these
              strategic goals.


              This also means some members of PR&D won’t be continuing with the Ethereum Foundation. We hope these individuals
              continue on in the Ethereum ecosystem and encourage others building out their teams to seek them out.


              The changes we’re announcing today are a departure from our previous ways of working, but we feel these set
              us on a more responsive and effective path. To mark the beginning of this new chapter and structure, we’d like
              to reintroduce “Protocol R&D” to the world under a new name: [Protocol](https://protocol.ethereum.foundation).


              ## Strategic initiatives


              Over the last year, many of us concluded that we needed to do a better job articulating our priorities. In conversation
              with our community, our collective mind has produced three ambitious goals for us to achieve in short order:
              _scale L1, scale blobs, improve UX_. Doing so successfully is the most valuable work we could be doing on behalf
              of our community, and it is our responsibility to deliver on it.


              It is time for us to ensure that these goals directly drive our attention and resource allocation. Each of these
              goals is now mapped to a _strategic initiative_ for Protocol, a shared workspace to bring our complementary
              talents together. We encourage every team in Protocol to consider how their work is supporting our execution
              of these strategic initiatives.


              Critical to our execution is the presence of leaders in our group whom the community trusts. We are being more
              explicit in assigning leaders to accelerate our strategic initiatives in order to increase accountability.


              Specifically, the following people are responsible for ensuring the EF executes on each of its strategic goals:


              - Scale L1: Tim Beiko & Ansgar Dietrichs

              - Scale L2: Alex Stokes & Francesco D’Amato

              - Improve UX: Barnabé Monnot & Josh Rudolf


              They will be supported by Dankrad Feist, who will act as a strategic advisor to all tracks, as well as the leads
              for the projects defined to move these goals forward.


              You can find more details on our three strategic initiatives [here](https://protocol.ethereum.foundation/strategic-initiatives).


              ## Teams


              More than ever, we are required to solve problems bringing the abilities of all Protocol members at once. Rapidly
              transitioning research into prototypes and to production means that we need tighter collaboration and feedback
              loops. We have seen [many](https://github.com/ethereum/pm/issues/1554) [more](https://blog.ethereum.org/2025/02/21/pectra-audit)
              [bridges](https://x.com/ignaciohagopian/status/1925880149750272100) [form](https://ethresear.ch/t/zkfocil-inclusion-list-privacy-using-linkable-ring-signatures/21688)
              [across](https://ethresear.ch/t/the-road-to-post-quantum-ethereum-transaction-is-paved-with-account-abstraction-aa/21783)
              [our](https://efdn.notion.site/prc2) [teams](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJkuwuh2Nrs) over the past years,
              bringing tangible results. With a shared vision, we must ensure that our shared home is incredible to work in.


              Being open in our collaboration with every member of Protocol requires shared expectations and high trust that
              each of us is delivering at their highest level. Team leads will be responsible for ensuring that their members
              meet our bar for technical excellence and enjoy continuous growth, pushing themselves ever further.


              Protocol is now a more united and leaner organization with more focused teams. You can find our updated org
              chart [here](https://protocol.ethereum.foundation/teams).


              ## Our community


              Protocol cannot accomplish everything on its own. Our ecosystem is made stronger from the work of many other
              core research and development teams, who amplify our own efforts and bring features to reality. Our role is
              not to replace these teams, but to set a high standard for ourselves in our work with them.


              Protocol is driving efforts towards [reconfiguring our main governance forums](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/reconfiguring-allcoredevs/23370)
              and [introducing new ones](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/protocol-research-call/23261). It is critical to
              continue eliciting the right signals and translating them into action.


              We are looking for new members to join us in this effort, and become a part of the larger Ethereum core development
              community. Two roles we believe are critical to help us solve real problems for Ethereum users are a [**UX Lead**](https://jobs.lever.co/ethereumfoundation/07366f81-c0a4-4ddb-ad66-b6c95fc217dc)
              and [**Performance Engineering Lead**](https://jobs.lever.co/ethereumfoundation/be6ed94c-c52f-4e83-a9d4-79901389c45d).
              In addition to these, we welcome exceptional applicants who are excited about our mission to let us know in
              our [**General Application**](https://jobs.lever.co/ethereumfoundation/824e5aa6-cda4-438b-8901-125ab53cdacb).


              So let’s do it together. **Let’s ship Protocol.**

              # Announcing the 2025 EF Internship Program!


              ## Posted by Protocol Support Team on November 16, 2024


              [Research & Development](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/research-and-development)


              > The 2025 Ethereum Foundation internship applications are open! Both [research](https://jobs.lever.co/ethereumfoundation/bac0fd4a-a8de-45f0-9223-2df882a7022e)
              and [development](https://jobs.lever.co/ethereumfoundation/4881baf8-f006-4885-aaac-8bd5c9ca836a) teams have
              open positions. Applications close on December 9, 2024.


              The Ethereum Foundation is running its first formal summer internship program in 2025 aimed at nurturing the
              next generation of Ethereum developers and researchers.


              Interns will work alongside EF teams and, with the help of dedicated mentors, contribute directly to core projects
              in key areas such as protocol security, account abstraction, scaling research, client development, and more.
              For example, a past intern worked on [MEV smoothing research](https://ethresear.ch/t/committee-driven-mev-smoothing/10408)
              before eventually joining the EF full time.


              ### Who is this for?


              Applicants should be [familiar with the Ethereum protocol](https://epf.wiki/#/) and available for full-time
              work. If currently in university, they should be advanced in their studies. Applicants should have demonstrable
              interest in the speciality of the team with whom they apply to work.


              ### Program


              Selected interns will be assigned a short-term project and a mentor and should expect to work somewhat autonomously.
              Interns can choose to either work remotely, or in one of the EF offices, in Boulder (USA) or Berlin (Germany).
              In addition, interns will be invited for an in-person cohort meetup in the summer.


              ### EPF vs internship


              The internship is geared toward those available for a defined ''summer time'' commitment with a general skillset
              and a desire to learn how to apply that skillset to the Ethereum domain. In contrast, the existing [Ethereum
              Protocol Fellowship](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/05/13/epf-5-announcement) is a six month program that assumes
              advanced knowledge and a desire for full-time work in Ethereum.


              ### Application Process


              Applications are live and will close on December 9, 2024. Initial screenings will be followed by formal interviews,
              with the notification process expected to be complete by 10 Jan.


              The duration of the program will be approximately 12 weeks with start and end dates flexible depending on university
              schedules.


              You can apply for the roles here:


              - [Reseach internship](https://jobs.lever.co/ethereumfoundation/bac0fd4a-a8de-45f0-9223-2df882a7022e)

              - [Software engineering internship](https://jobs.lever.co/ethereumfoundation/4881baf8-f006-4885-aaac-8bd5c9ca836a)

              1. **Protocol Security** \- The Protocol Security Research team safeguards Ethereum’s integrity. Through coordination,
              meticulous code reviews, research, developing advanced tooling, and real-world simulations, we focus on securing
              the network and its critical components. Our hands-on approach includes managing the bug bounty program, continuously
              monitoring the network, and collaborating with client teams. We’re committed to identifying and mitigating risks
              to Ethereum mainnet. Check out the [Protocol Security README](https://github.com/ethereum/protocol-security?tab=readme-ov-file)


              _Preferred skills:_ Cybersecurity classes or experience


              2. **Robust Incentives Group** \- The Robust Incentives Group is a research team dedicated to the study of mechanism
              design and cryptoeconomics for Ethereum. Our work maps all the ways that incentives directly or indirectly affect
              users and protocol stakeholders of Ethereum. Where possible, we propose mechanisms to recover incentive compatibility
              and system optimality. Our methods are varied, from formal analysis to data science and simulations, and we
              engage academic and general audiences with diverse formats of grants, publications and talks. Check out our
              work [on our homepage](https://tinyurl.com/ethrig) and follow our updates with [our newsletter](https://robustincentives.substack.com/)!


              _Preferred skills:_ Familiarity with RIG initiatives, previous work or writings in mechanism design or economics
              research


              3. **Portal Network** \- The Portal Network is a new networking design for Ethereum that aims to solve the data
              availability problem for "light" nodes without having to trust or put extra strain on full nodes, by sharing
              the necessary data in small chunks across the network. Check out the [ethereum.org explainer](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/networking-layer/portal-network/),
              talks from [Devcon SEA 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZ_yWmm7ISg), [Devcon Bogotá 2022](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0stc9jnQLXA),
              the [network specs](https://github.com/ethereum/portal-network-specs).


              _Preferred skills:_ Computer science classes, some Rust knowledge


              4. **Testing** \- The EEST project is responsible for the Ethereum protocol reference tests, used by all clients
              to detect consensus issues during new hard-fork implementations and regressions.

              The team also takes care of maintaining and improving the tooling, frameworks, documentation and guidance required
              to facilitate the client developers with the consumption of the tests, which includes the EEST, the legacy ethereum/tests
              repository, and also integration tests in the form of various hive simulators.

              Check out the [Devcon SEA 2024 talk](https://app.devcon.org/schedule/GZBP8A) on EEST.


              _Preferred skills:_ Testing frameworks (Hive) and methodologies (fuzzing, simulations)


              5. **EELS** \- The EELS project is responsible for the main Ethereum protocol reference specification written
              in Python, which aims towards replacing the yellow-paper specification and being a crucial aid to the EIP process
              in order to provide a prototyping framework for new updates.

              Check out the [Devcon SEA 2024 talk](https://app.devcon.org/schedule/3GCD7S) on EELS.


              _Preferred skills:_ Spec writing, technical documentation, formal verification


              6. **Geth** \- Geth (go-ethereum) is a Go implementation of Ethereum - a gateway into the decentralized web.
              Geth has been a core part of Ethereum since the very beginning. Geth was one of the original Ethereum implementations
              making it the most battle-hardened and tested client.

              Geth is an Ethereum execution client meaning it handles transactions, deployment and execution of smart contracts
              and contains an embedded computer known as the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Running Geth alongside a consensus
              client turns a computer into an Ethereum node.

              You can find more information on [Geth''s website](https://geth.ethereum.org/).


              _Preferred skills:_ Go, devp2p


              7. **Account Abstraction** \- The [AA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDDXd5jTwpU) team focuses on the development,
              growth and coordination efforts related to account abstraction and chain abstraction, which started via the
              [ERC-4337 standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4337), and continue through additional standards and
              protocol level changes on L1 as well as L2s.

              The team is responsible for research and development of various components and standards of [account abstraction](https://app.devcon.org/schedule/S7NYUJ),
              chain abstraction and cross-L2 communication. It also supports entities in the ecosystem that are building on
              top of these standards, while advocating for their overall adoption in the space through education, conferences,
              grants and other growth strategies.


              _Preferred skills:_ Solidity, EVM, ERC4337, wallet design


              8. **Generalist** \- If you have a specific project in mind that deals with the general Ethereum governance
              process or another core protocol project, propose it!


              _Skills:_ This role is for exceptional individuals with specific projects in mind and intimate familiarity with
              the Ethereum governance process.

              ## Posted by EF EcoDev Research Team on October 11, 2024


              [Organizational](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/organizational)


              The EcoDev Research Team at the Ethereum Foundation is excited to announce the launch of five six-month research
              fellowship positions. **This fellowship offers the opportunity for participants to dive deep into underexplored

              # 4844 Data Challenge: Insights and Winners


              ## Posted by Rodrigo Vasquez on September 13, 2024


              [Research & Development](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/research-and-development)


              In March 2024, the Ethereum network underwent a significant upgrade with the implementation of EIP-4844, an
              essential part of the Dencun hardfork, aimed at bolstering Ethereum’s role as a data availability layer. This
              upgrade introduced "blobs" of data, dramatically enhancing the scalability of Layer 2 solutions by increasing
              data availability by approximately 100 times. As with any major upgrade, it’s crucial to evaluate its impact,
              understand its implications, and refine our approach moving forward.


              To that end, we launched a dedicated data collection round, inviting researchers and developers to delve into
              the empirical impacts of EIP-4844. The response was overwhelming, with submissions exploring everything from
              consensus layer security to rollup economics. Today, we are thrilled to announce the winners of this round,
              who have provided critical insights into how this pivotal upgrade is reshaping the Ethereum ecosystem.

              # Sepolia Incident


              ## Posted by Marius van der Wijden, Toni Wahrstätter, Parithosh Jayanthi on March 21, 2024


              [Security](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/security)


              This blog post discloses a threat against the Ethereum network that was present from the Merge up until the
              Dencun hard fork.


              ## Background


              Prior to the merge, different message size limits for RPC communication were set to protect clients from denial-of-service
              (DOS) attacks. These limits, applied to messages received via HTTP endpoints, were carried over to the engine
              API, which plays a crucial role in connecting Execution and Consensus Layer clients during block production.
              Due to the engine API''s involvement in block production, it became possible for blocks to be produced that
              surpassed the RPC size limits of some clients but remained within the acceptable range for others.


              If an attacker creates a message that exceeds the size limit of the client with the lowest setting, while still
              adhering to the gas limit requirements, and then waits for a block to be produced, it could result in a situation
              where some clients regard the block as valid, while others reject it, issuing a HTTP error code "413: Content
              Too Large."


              ## Impact


              An attacker that could craft these messages would be able to force the majority of nodes (=geth) to reject blocks
              that a minority would accept. These blocks would be forked away and the proposer would miss out on rewards.


              In the beginning we thought that it was only possible to create these blocks by using builders or a modified
              version of a client. Geth has a builtin limit of 128KB for transactions, which means that a big transaction
              like the one under discussion would not end up in the transaction pools of any geth node. It was however possible
              to still trigger the limit by having a client with a higher limit propose the block and the CL requesting validation
              of this proposed bigger block.


              We proposed a solution in temporarily lowering the RPC limit on all clients to the lowest value (5MB). This
              would make the block invalid and an attacker would be very limited in the chaos they can cause in the network
              since the majority of the nodes would reject their blocks.


              However on February 7th we discovered that it was possible to create a block that would hit the 5MB limit with
              a bunch of transactions that are below the 128KB limit and not exceed 30 million gas.


              This is a bigger issue because we realized an attacker could create a bunch of high paying transactions and
              send them to the network. Since he outpays everyone else in the mempool, every node (even geth nodes) would
              include the attack transactions in their block thus creating a block that would not be accepted by the majority
              of the network, resulting in a lot of forks (all being deemed valid by the minority nodes) and the chain keeps
              reorging over and over again.


              Later on February 7th, we came to the conclusion that everyone raising their RPC limits would be the safer alternative.


              ## Timeline


              - 2024-02-06 13:00: Toni (EF), Pari (EF) and Justin (Besu) try to submit a specificly grinded transaction to
              the network. The transaction contributes to up to 2.7 MB blocks when snappy compressed.

              - 2024-02-06 13:25: Pari receives errors from his local Geth node although the transaction should be valid.

              - 2024-02-06 15:14: Justin managed to put the transaction in a block and submitted it through the Besu client.

              - 2024-02-06 20:46: Sam (EF) alerts Pari (special thanks to [mysticryuujin](https://twitter.com/mysticryuujin)
              on X), Toni and Alex about certain Sepolia nodes struggeling.

              - 2024-02-06 21:05: Team double checks with Marius from Geth and confirms the bug.

              - 2024-02-06 21:10: The gang gets together to debug it

              - 2024-02-07 23:40: We decided for all clients to limit their RPC request limit to 5MB

              - 2024-02-07 6:40: We discovered that there might be a bigger issue and the attack can be executed with transactions
              less than 128KB size.

              - 2024-02-07 10:00: We decided for all clients to increase the RPC request limit.

              - 2024-02-07 21:00: The fix was merged in geth.

              - 2024-02-09: Geth was released


              ## Remediation


              While Geth was the only client affected by this bug, other clients have also updated their defaults to be safe
              of this attack even if gas limits are increased.

              The client teams indicated that the following updates have the safe rpc limits:


              Geth: v1.13.12


              Nethermind: v1.25.4


              Besu: 24.1.2


              Erigon: v2.58.0


              Reth: v0.1.0-alpha.18

              ## Posted by Devcon Team on June 14, 2024


              [Events](https://blog.ethereum.org/category/events)


              Dear Ethereum explorers,


              Announcements are coming [one](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/06/11/devcon7-ticket-detail) [after](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/06/07/devcon7-scholars)
              [another](https://blog.ethereum.org/2024/05/29/devcon7-supporters-impact) as we get closer to Devcon. Today
              we’re thrilled to announce the launch of a quadratic funding round for SEA communities by [clr.fund](https://clr.fund/#/)!


              We see the excitement and grassroots energy in Southeast Asia growing and have witnessed the passion from local
              builders firsthand during our SEA tour in April.


              ## A special initiative: Quadratic funding for SEA communities 👏


              Southeast Asian Ethereum communities are organizing a quadratic funding round together with clr.fund specifically
              for the region! The Devcon team is proud to support this initiative by contributing to the matching pool with
              30.000 USD. This funding method emphasizes the importance of community choice, allowing the preference of community
              members to guide the distribution of funds.

              ## A new way to use the internet


              ### Crypto without volatility


              Stablecoins are currencies that maintain stable value. Their price matches the U.S. dollar or other steady assets.


              [Discover stablecoins](https://ethereum.org/en/stablecoins/)


              ### A fairer financial system


              Billions can''t open bank accounts or freely use their money. Ethereum''s financial system is always open and
              unbiased.

          in blockchain, allowing complex off-chain computations to be compressed into succinct, verifiable proofs without
          relying on third-party trust or revealing sensitive inputs.** This technology has moved beyond theoretical foundations
          and early blockchain applications, experiencing explosive growth in the 2020s with the rise of ZK Rollups, zk-STARKs,
          zkEVMs, and general-purpose zkVMs. **ZK Rollups, including zkSync and Polygon zkEVM, are a core Layer 2 scaling
          path as they compress batches of transactions for scaling.** Polygon zkEVM is categorized as a Type 2.5 zkEVM, which
          makes slight modifications to the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) for better performance while maintaining high EVM
          equivalence. **zkSync Era is a Type 3 zkEVM, featuring deeper architectural modifications that allow most applications
          to run but cannot fully reuse Ethereum infrastructure.** The efficiency of ZKPs can be significantly enhanced by
          leveraging massively parallel computing architectures like NVIDIA CUDA, especially for computationally intensive
          processes like ZKP generation, which involves complex mathematical operations such as polynomial commitments and
          elliptic curve cryptography. This acceleration directly contributes to increased transaction throughput and reduced
          fees on Layer 2 solutions like Polygon zkEVM. Furthermore, ZKPs are crucial for enterprises requiring privacy in
          sensitive areas like supply chain or healthcare, while still benefiting from the security and auditability of a
          public blockchain, and they are also a leading Layer-2 scaling solution.

          **Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are utilized in decentralized dark pools to achieve universal trade privacy, both
          pre- and post-trade, by keeping order books encrypted and settling trades in zero-knowledge.** This technology prevents
          front-running and minimizes slippage for large orders in DeFi, as seen with projects like Renegade, which operates
          on Arbitrum (an Ethereum layer-2) and uses multi-party computation and zero-knowledge proofs to hide order details
          from validators. The Poseidon hash function, introduced in 2019, is designed for arithmetic circuits and specifically
          optimized for zero-knowledge systems, reducing computational costs significantly compared to older hashes. **It
          is already being used in Layer 2 solutions such as Polygon''s zkEVM and StarkNet to enable faster, more efficient
          rollups.** The Ethereum Foundation has launched the Poseidon Cryptanalysis Initiative to stress-test this function
          before its potential integration into Ethereum''s Layer 1, aiming to ensure its security and validate its role in
          making Ethereum faster, leaner, and quantum-proof.
