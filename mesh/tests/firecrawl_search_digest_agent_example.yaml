  output:
    response: '**Blockchain integration in Web3 AI is often driven by the need to access funding rather than technical necessity,
      which can stifle innovation.** "Web3 AI projects often force blockchain integration to access capital, harming innovation
      by prioritizing ecosystem compatibility over practical AI solutions." https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-ai-de-ai
      (August 08, 2025). This trend creates a "false equivalency where decentralized AI is equated with blockchain AI, stifling

      **Decentralized AI encompasses various technologies like distributed computing, federated learning, P2P networks, and
      edge computing, none of which inherently require blockchain infrastructure.** "Decentralized AI includes distributed
      computing, federated learning, P2P networks and edge computing, none of which inherently require blockchain infrastructure."
      https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-ai-de-ai (August 08, 2025). Federated learning, for example, allows multiple

      (August 8, 2025).


      **While blockchain can be a useful tool for specific decentralized AI functions, such as on-chain settlement for payments
      between AI agents, cryptographic proofs for reputation systems, and token-aligned incentives, it is not a universal
      solution.** "Onchain settlement can simplify payments between AI agents, cryptographic proofs can improve reputation
      systems, and tokens can align incentives in collaborative training. But those are specialized tools, not one-size-all
      solutions." https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-ai-de-ai (August 08, 2025). For many decentralized AI problems,
      blockchain can add latency, complexity, and cost. https://cointelegraph.com/news/blockchain-ai-de-ai (August 08, 2025).


      **Successful decentralized AI projects exist without blockchain integration, but they are often overlooked within the
      Web3 community due to the "blockchain-first" mentality.** "Prime Intellect has trained large language models at scale
      while preserving decentralization. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s NANDA is building a decentralized internet
      of agents. LAION is democratizing AI research. These systems achieve genuine decentralization; they don’t carry a blockchain

          \ plans to **\"transition from its PoW consensus mechanism to a proof-of-stake (PoS) model\"** to address scalability\
          \ concerns. This transition will \"reduce computational requirements and improve the blockchain’s energy efficiency.\"\
          \ Additionally, Ethereum relies on **\"layer-1 scaling solutions such as sharding to eventually scale to 100,000\
          \ transactions per second.\"** Sharding involves \"splitting up transactions into small data sets and then using\
          \ a horizontally split processing algorithm to parallelly process them.\" (August 8, 2025)\n*   **Layer-2 Scaling\
          \ Solutions:** Layer-2 solutions were \"originally coined as a collective term to describe a specific set of Ethereum\
          \ scaling solutions\" and were \"intended to cater to demand exceeding the blockchain’s 1+ million transactions\
          \ per day capacity.\" These solutions \"enable thousands of low-value transactions to be processed after validation\
          \ on parallel blockchains, with records then being transferred to the main blockchain, or mainnet, to ensure that\
          \ they are immutably recorded.\" (August 8, 2025)\n    *   **Rollups:** These are \"layer-2 scaling solutions that\
          \ ultimately inherit the security provided by Ethereum.\" They \"packet multiple transactions into a single mainnet\
          \ transaction.\"\n        *   **Optimistic Rollups:** These \"are blockchains that sit parallel to the main chain\
          \ and avoid the computation that makes Ethereum expensive.\" They \"essentially assum[e] all posted transactions\
          \ to be valid\" and offer security by \"being able to run fault proofs in the event of an invalid transaction being\
          \ suspected.\" They also \"enjoy complete Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) and Solidity compatibility.\" (August 8,\
          \ 2025)\n        *   **Zero-knowledge Rollups (zk-Rollups):** These \"employ validity proofs to compute transactions\
          \ off-chain and subsequently compress hundreds of transactions before posting cryptographic validity proofs on the\
          \ Ethereum mainnet.\" They provide \"near-zero delays in cryptocurrency fund transfer from layer-2 to layer-1 chain.\"\
          \ (August 8, 2025)\n    *   **Sidechains:** These are \"separate blockchains that operate independently with their\
          \ own consensus mechanisms but also run in parallel to the Ethereum mainnet with a two-way bridge connecting both\
          \ blockchains.\" They are not technically layer-2 solutions due to a \"lower degree of decentralization.\" (August\
          \ 8, 2025)\n    *   **State Channels (Payment Channels):** In these, \"crypto funds are deposited in a smart contract\
          \ on the layer-1 blockchain, and signed tickets are produced on the former.\" An example is the Raiden Network for\
          \ Ethereum. (August 8, 2025)\n    *   **Plasma Chains:** These are \"anchored to the Ethereum mainnet and use fraud\
          \ proofs, similar to Optimistic Rollups, to check for transaction validity in case of a dispute.\" They are preferred\
          \ for \"high speeds with lower gas fees.\" (August 8, 2025)\n    *   **Nested Blockchains:** Similar to plasma chains,\
          \ these \"involve multiple interconnected secondary chains that run on top of the layer-1 blockchain,\" forming\
          \ a parent-child relationship to distribute work. (August 8, 2025)\n    *   **Validiums:** These are \"eerily similar\

          \ high amounts of computational power.\" (August 8, 2025)\n*   **Scalability Trilemma:** Both layer-1 and layer-2\
          \ solutions aim to solve the \"scalability trilemma,\" a term coined by Vitalik Buterin, which refers to the challenge\
          \ of simultaneously achieving decentralization, security, and scalability in distributed ledger technology networks.\

          \ own validators rather than centralized sequencers\" and \"represent the purest form of Ethereum scaling.\" (August\
          \ 13, 2025)\n*   **Preconfirmation Technology:** Taiko's preconfirmation system aims to \"improve transaction predictability\
          \ and overall usability of based rollups.\" With phase one, Taiko delivers \"transaction times of approximately\
          \ 2 seconds while maintaining complete decentralization.\" This technology \"enables near-instant transaction finality\

        processed_summary: '**Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in zkSync and Polygon Ecosystems**


          Zero-knowledge proofs are a core technology for scaling Ethereum, and both zkSync and Polygon are actively utilizing
          them.


          **zkSync and ZKPs:**

          *   **zkSync** is a ZK-rollup that bundles and compresses transactions, proving their correctness with ZKPs before
          sending those proofs back to Ethereum. This allows for faster finality with an emphasis on user-friendly interfaces
          and performance. It is **ideal for NFT platforms, games, and fast-paced dApps**.

          *   **zkSync Era''s Account Abstraction (AA)** simplifies user onboarding and enables gas sponsorship or paying
          gas with a project''s native token instead of ETH, significantly improving user experience while maintaining decentralization.

          *   The **zkStack from Matter Labs** (creators of zkSync) uses zk-SNARK proofs to enable confidential smart contract
          execution. It features Hyperbridges with account-abstraction wallet integration and a TypeScript-first development
          environment, useful for privacy-preserving DeFi and AI model verification.

          *   Projects like **DOVU** use zkSync to issue carbon credits with minimal gas usage by batching actions and submitting
          only essential data on-chain, proving efficient sustainable finance.

          *   zkSync is mentioned as a platform offering **ready-to-go frameworks** for developing ZK rollup solutions.


          **Polygon and ZKPs:**

          *   **Polygon Zero** is explicitly mentioned as a project using ZK-rollups to scale Ethereum without sacrificing
          decentralization.

          *   **Polygon zkEVM** is a Layer 2 solution that integrates with ecosystems like Linea to launch institutional settlement
          APIs for zkEVM trading environments. It aims to achieve high throughput, with benchmarks showing it can achieve
          **2,000+ transactions per second (TPS) with Ethereum security guarantees**.

          *   The **Polygon CDK (Chain Development Kit)** is highlighted for its multi-client zkEVM with unified liquidity
          through AggLayer. It supports parallel transaction execution with a shared sequencer architecture and native bridging
          to Ethereum mainnet, catering to enterprises requiring public liquidity with private execution.

          *   The **Poseidon hash function**, a rising star in zero-knowledge proofs designed for arithmetic circuits, is
          actively being vetted by the Ethereum Foundation through the Poseidon Cryptanalysis Initiative. This initiative
          is crucial for its potential integration into Ethereum''s Layer 1 via the Pectra hard fork, and **Polygon''s zkEVM**
          already utilizes Poseidon.

          *   The Polygon CDK is also listed as a platform offering **ready-to-go frameworks** for developing ZK rollup solutions.


          **General ZKP Information & Context:**

          *   Zero-knowledge proofs allow proving something is true without revealing the underlying data, offering a new
          path where trust doesn''t require disclosure.

          *   **ZK-rollups** are a Layer-2 scaling solution that bundles thousands of transactions off-chain, computes a validity
          proof (a single succinct proof), and publishes that proof back to the main chain, significantly reducing gas fees
          and increasing transaction speeds.

          *   **ZK-SNARKs** (Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge) are compact, fast, and efficient but require
          a trusted setup.

          *   **ZK-STARKs** (Scalable Transparent ARgument of Knowledge) do not require a trusted setup but have larger proofs
          and more overhead.

          *   Both SNARKs and STARKs rely on transforming logic into **arithmetic circuits** to demonstrate valid computation
          without revealing inputs.

          *   Zero-knowledge proofs enable **confidential audits and privacy-preserving machine learning model verification**
          in enterprise applications like confidential voting systems and selective financial disclosure.

          *   The development of a ZK rollup solution can range from **$25,000 to over $500,000**, influenced by project scope,
          proof system complexity, developer experience, framework usage (e.g., zkSync, Polygon CDK), Layer-1 integration
          costs, infrastructure, and security audits.

          *   Ongoing costs for ZK rollups include infrastructure and hosting (e.g., $1,000 to $5,000+ per month), proof generation
          and data availability fees (e.g., $0.10 to $1+ per proof), Layer-1 settlement costs (e.g., $5,000 to $10,000+ monthly
          for high-throughput rollups), and maintenance.

          *   **Optimizing ZK rollup development costs** can be achieved by utilizing open-source frameworks like zkSync and
          Polygon CDK, outsourcing ZK expertise, using Rollup-as-a-Service (RaaS) providers, and batching transactions.


          The search results are highly relevant to the query, providing specific details on how both zkSync and Polygon utilize
          zero-knowledge proofs for scaling Ethereum, offering concrete examples of their implementation and discussing the
          associated costs and benefits.'
