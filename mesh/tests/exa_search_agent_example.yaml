            \ distribution is one example of a theoretically secure communication\
            \ technique. \n Exploiting the coherence of light waves (their potential\
            \ to interact predictably) can extend the range of quantum communications,\
            \ but scalability has been limited by the need for specialized equipment,\
            \ such as cryogenic coolers. \n An approach that enables the distribution\
            \ of quantum information through optical fiber cables, without the need\
            \ for cryogenic cooling, is described by Mirko Pittaluga and colleagues.\
            \ \n Their system uses a coherence-based twin-field quantum key distribution,\
            \ which facilitates the distribution of secure information over long distances.\
            \ \n The quantum communications network was deployed over three telecommunication\
            \ data centers in Germany (Frankfurt, Kehl and Kirchfeld), connected by\
            \ 254 km of commercial optical fiber—a new record distance for real-world\

          text: 'Sundar Pichai with one of Google’s Quantum Computers in the Santa
            Barbara lab, California, in October 2019. Handout . | Reuters While there
            are still differing perspectives on how long it will be until certain
            types of quantum computing hit commercial viability, experts from big
            tech companies like Google and IBM as well as smaller organizations like
            D-Wave Quantum and TreQ generally agree on quantum’s most mature, promising
            industry applications, which range from medical insights to last-mile
            delivery optimization. Yet, in a space teeming with unknowns, there’s
            still a lot to learn about the potential fate of a world in quantum’s
            hands. Unlike classical computing, which processes information through
            bits that can exist in either zeros or ones, quantum computing is an evolving
            field where quantum bits (or qubits) can occupy both zero and one in a
            single unit. These qubits can then basically communicate with each other
            to further increase the speed and complexity of information processing
            in a calculation. Within the field of quantum computing, there are two
            types of technologies. What most people refer to when they talk about
            it is universal gate-based models. The second model is called annealing
            quantum. “It’s a different technology,” explained Mandy Birch, CEO and
            founder of TreQ, a quantum systems engineering company focused on manufacturing
            applications. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Amazon and IBM are aggressively
            pursuing gate-model quantum computing, each with different qubit technologies
            and strategies. D-Wave is largely working with annealing technology, which
            primarily serves companies that want to optimize their operations. Annealing
            models still have a ways to go, but unlike gate models that researchers
            are still developing, annealing is able to deliver commercial value today.
            “It’s more of a heuristic than it is an absolute solution,” Birch said
            about annealing technology. Still, these systems can generally help companies
            improve operational efficiency compared to what they can achieve with
            classical computing systems. Quantum chip applications: Hype vs. reality
            “Quantum computers are capable of solving problems that are impossible
            for AI or supercomputers even in the best case,” said Charina Chou, chief
            operating officer at Google Quantum AI, maker of the quantum computing
            processor Willow chip at the recent SXSW conference. Here, Chou is referring
            to a concept called quantum supremacy, where quantum technology completes
            complex calculations no classical computer could realistically complete
            (for example, a five-minute quantum calculation might take 10 septillion
            years on a binary supercomputer). Alternatively, some quantum systems
            may achieve quantum advantage, where they simply do better than classical
            computing. Scientists at D-Wave as well as institutions like Vancouver’s
            Quantum Matter Institute published a breakthrough report in March announcing
            that its annealing quantum technology achieved “the world’s first and
            only demonstration of quantum computational supremacy on a useful, real-world
            problem.” The company performed magnetic materials simulation in minutes
            with a level of accuracy that would take nearly one million years using
            a classical supercomputer. In an interview, D-Wave CEO Alan Baratz explained
            that this capability can advance technologies like smartphones and sensors.
            “We use sensors in MRIs, brain scanners, heart scanners. These sensors
            are magnetic material,” he said. “The benefit that comes from this is
            the ability to see things in the human body that we still can’t see for
            better understanding, better diagnosis.” Barataz also told CNBC back in
            January that D-Wave is “commercial today,” and companies including Mastercard and
            Japan’s NTT Docomo are using its quantum computers in production to benefit
            their business operations. “Not 30 years from now, not 20 years from now,
            not 15 years from now,” Baratz said. It is also used by Patterson Food
            Group to optimize workforce scheduling. D-Wave’s revenue is still low,
            with the most recent quarterly sales reported at $1.9 million. Chou also
            pointed to the importance of quantum’s advancements in the medical space.
            “Twenty-one years ago, my husband [...] was facing a very tough cancer
            diagnosis,” she said. He went through chemo and radiation, neither of
            which worked, but he was fortunate enough to get on a clinical trial that
            saved him. Today, Chou’s husband is an oncologist. Using quantum computing
            for “calculating fundamentally what is happening inside these molecules
            themselves” could increase our ability to solve these problems, Chou said.
            Drug discovery a good quantum bet for future On the gate-model side of
            the quantum equation, Birch is confident that any place a high-performance
            computer is important today is going to be majorly changed by quantum
            in the future. But she added, “I don’t know if that means in five years,
            10 years or 20 years.” She foresees the financial industry making use
            of quantum optimization, but she’s particularly excited about the impact
            on the pharmaceutical industry, which is inherently quantum mechanical
            because of its use of organic compounds (actually, all matter and energy
            is quantum mechanical by nature). Referring to pharmaceutical work, Birch
            said, “Right now, the molecular dynamics are so complex that the math
            quickly gets out of hand. ... But just imagine, in a drug discovery process,
            instead of having to do all the wet chemistry one experiment at a time,
            to be able to run through millions of simulations on a computer at a molecular
            dynamics level before you ever get into the wet chemistry and the trial.”
            This, she said, would give scientists a much higher probability of finding
            solutions, and that would also inform industries including aerospace and
            defense. Some worry about potential negative impact given how powerful
            the tech could be, but Birch said, “Technology is always neutral. It’s
            when you put it into human hands that it does good or bad.” “Then there’s
            more boring and ubiquitous things like optimization,” Birch said. “If
            you can save 1% on your fuel bill if you’re FedEx, UPS, that’s really
            important.” Port logistics optimization is already in action today. One
            thing that any quantum solution will likely do is perform computations
            using hybrid solutions that partner with supercomputers and AI computers.
            Some work can be done natively on quantum alone, but with all of the infrastructure
            that is already in place, it makes sense to use what’s out there.'

        - title: DARPA announces 15 companies selected for first phase of its Quantum
            Benchmarking Initiative

          text: The United States’ Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA)
            has announced 15 of the 18 quantum computing companies chosen to enter
            the initial phase of its Quantum Benchmarking Initiative (QBI). The program
            aims to determine whether it's possible to build a fault-tolerant quantum
            computer within a decade and if any quantum computing approach can achieve
            utility-scale operation by 2033. The chosen companies are based across
            the globe and include Alice &amp; Bob, Atlantic Quantum, Atom Computing,
            Diraq, HPE, IonQ, Nord Quantique, Oxford Ionics, Photonic Inc., Quantinuum,
            Quantum Motion, Rigetti, Silicon Quantum Computing, and Xanadu. Over the
            next six months, the companies will provide “comprehensive technical details
            of their concepts to show that they hold water and could plausibly lead
            to a transformative, fault-tolerant quantum computer in under 10 years,”
            Joe Altepeter, DARPA QBI program manager, said. Companies that successfully
            complete Stage A will move to a yearlong Stage B, during which DARPA will
            analyze their research and development approach. A final Stage C will
            follow, where the QBI independent verification and validation (IV&amp;V)
            team will test the companies' computer hardware. "During Stage B, we'll
            thoroughly review all aspects of their R&amp;D plans to see if they can
            go the distance — not just meet next year's milestones — and stand the
            test of trying to build a transformative technology on this kind of a
            timeline," Altepeter said. "Those who make it through Stages A and B will
            enter the final portion of the program, Stage C, where a full-size IV&amp;V
            team will conduct real-time, rigorous evaluation of the components, subsystems,
            and algorithms – everything that goes into building a fault-tolerant quantum
            computer for real. And we’ll do all these evaluations without slowing
            the companies down." In a statement, DARPA said QBI is not a competition
            between companies but instead is looking to evaluate the current landscape
            of commercial quantum computing efforts and “spot every company on a plausible
            path to a useful quantum computer.” QBI is not the only quantum initiative
            currently being overseen by DARPA. In February 2025, it announced that
            Microsoft and PsiQuantum had entered the third and final phase of its
            Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) initiative.
            US2QC is a pilot program that was ultimately expanded to become QBI following
            the two companies’ successful completion of Stages A and B. The final
            phase of US2QC has the same technical goals as Stage C of QBI, DARPA said.

            \ behaves like a one-dimensional magnet — something previously thought\
            \ nearly impossible — opening exciting paths for next-gen quantum technologies.\
            \ Credit: SciTechDaily.com \n Scientists have discovered a rare form of\
            \ one-dimensional quantum magnetism in a metallic compound called Ti 4\
            \ MnBi 2, marking a major leap in quantum materials research. \n Unlike\
            \ previous materials that were insulators, this system is metallic and\
            \ shows strong interaction between magnetism and conduction, hinting at\
            \ entirely new possibilities in quantum computing and spintronics. The\
            \ experimental confirmation — supported by neutron scattering and advanced\
            \ simulations — opens the door to new classes of materials that could\
            \ redefine how we understand magnetism and electronic behavior at the\
            \ quantum level. \n Discovery of Rare Quantum Magnetism \n Researchers\
            \ at the University of British Columbia’s Blusson Quantum Matter Institute\
            \ (UBC Blusson QMI) have discovered a rare type of one-dimensional quantum\
            \ magnetism in a metallic compound called Ti 4 MnBi 2. This finding provides\
            \ the first experimental evidence for a state of matter that, until now,\
            \ had mostly existed in theory. The study, published on April 8 in Nature\
            \ Materials, arrives amid growing global interest in quantum materials\
            \ that blur the lines between magnetism, electrical conductivity, and\
            \ quantum coherence. \n “We proved the existence of a new class of quantum\
            \ materials that are both metallic and one-dimensional magnets, with strong\
            \ coupling between the magnetic moments and their metallic host,” said\
            \ UBC Blusson QMI Investigator Prof. Meigan Aronson. \n The Challenge\
            \ of True One-Dimensional Systems \n “Virtually all spin chain systems\
            \ studied so far are insulators that ultimately become three-dimensional\
            \ at low temperature due to coupling among the chains. This means that\
            \ the hallmark instabilities of quantum metals: superconductivity, metal-insulator\
            \ transitions, and also the origin of magnetism itself have not yet been\
            \ established in systems that are truly one-dimensional, either experimentally,\
            \ or (to a lesser extent) by theory,” Prof. Aronson said. \n A spin chain is\
            \ a one-dimensional arrangement of tiny magnets, called spins, that interact\
            \ with one another. Using neutron scattering measurements complemented\
            \ by Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and electronic structure\
            \ calculations, the team was able to show that Ti 4 MnBi 2  is a realization\
            \ of a very particular physical model consisting of spin chains where\
            \ the interactions among the spins are highly frustrated, leading to a\
            \ rich array of ordered phases that only exist at zero temperature. \n\
            \ One-Dimensional, Metallic, and Quantum Entangled \n Unlike three-dimensional\
            \ systems that order at nonzero temperatures, one-dimensional systems\
            \ like Ti₄MnBi₂ do not undergo true ordering due to strong quantum fluctuations\
            \ that dominate most measurable quantities. Ti₄MnBi₂ is only the second\
            \ known metallic system with confirmed one-dimensional magnetism (the\
            \ other is Yb 2 Pt 2 Pb), and the first in which the magnetism and metallic\
            \ host are strongly entangled. \n “By proving that this middle ground\
            \ exists, Ti 4 MnBi 2 presents an important step towards establishing\
            \ a broad quantum landscape ripe for exploration. It is possible that\
            \ the excellent correspondence between experiment and computational theory\
            \ that we have demonstrated might serve as a benchmark for quantum simulations.\
            \ In particular, we are interested in using the neutron scattering results\
            \ as a basis for comparison to different theoretical measures of quantum\
            \ entanglement,” Prof. Aronson said. \n The study was made possible by\
            \ the collaborative expertise housed within UBC Blusson QMI. On the experimental\
            \ front, the team included Dr. Xiyang Li and Dr. Mohamed Oudah, while\
            \ theoretical modeling and analysis were led by Scientific Staff Dr. Alberto\
            \ Nocera and Dr. Kateryna Foyevtsova, as well as Investigators Prof. George\
            \ Sawatzky and Prof. Meigan Aronson. The neutron scattering experiments,\
            \ which were critical to identifying the quantum spin behavior, were conducted\
            \ using the instruments at J-PARC in Japan. \n Implications for Spintronics\
            \ and Quantum Tech \n By bridging the gap between traditional magnetic\
            \ insulators and more complex electronic systems, the study opens new\
            \ avenues for advancements in spintronics and quantum computing. \n “Our\
            \ work represents an ideal testbed for quantum advantage demonstrations\
            \ within the context of quantum analog simulation. It also offers insights\
            \ that could be useful for the development of unique magnetic memories\
            \ with high density and speed,” said UBC Blusson QMI Staff Scientist Dr.\
            \ Alberto Nocera. \n Crystals, Collaboration, and Future Potential \n\
            \ “We grew more than 100 batches of high-quality single crystals of this\
            \ material, with more than 400 crystals co-aligned for use in the neutron\
            \ scattering experiments,” said Dr. Xiyang Li, the study’s first author\
            \ and a postdoctoral researcher at UBC Blusson QMI. “Our results unlock\

          text: "Quantum states can only be prepared and observed under highly controlled\
            \ conditions. A research team from Innsbruck, Austria, has now succeeded\
            \ in creating so-called hot Schrödinger cat states in a superconducting\
            \ microwave resonator. The study, recently published in Science Advances,\
            \ shows that quantum phenomena can also be observed and used in less perfect,\
            \ warmer conditions. \n Schrödinger cat states are a fascinating phenomenon\
            \ in quantum physics in which a quantum object exists simultaneously in\
            \ two different states. In Erwin Schrödinger's thought experiment, it\
            \ is a cat that is alive and dead at the same time. In real experiments,\
            \ such simultaneity has been seen in the locations of atoms and molecules\
            \ and in the oscillations of electromagnetic resonators. Previously, these\
            \ analogues to Schrödinger's thought experiment were created by first\
            \ cooling the quantum object to its ground state, the state with the lowest\
            \ possible energy. Now, researchers led by Gerhard Kirchmair and Oriol\
            \ Romero-Isart have demonstrated for the first time that it is indeed\
            \ possible to create quantum superpositions from thermally excited states.\
            \ \"Schrödinger also assumed a living, i.e. 'hot' cat in his thought experiment,\"\
            \ remarks Gerhard Kirchmair from the Department of Experimental Physics\
            \ at the University of Innsbruck and the Institute of Quantum Optics and\
            \ Quantum Information (IQOQI) of the Austrian Academy of Sciences (ÖAW).\
            \ \"We wanted to know whether these quantum effects can also be generated\
            \ if we don't start from the 'cold' ground state,\" says Kirchmair. \n\
            \ In their study published in the Science Advances, the researchers used\
            \ a transmon qubit in a microwave resonator to generate the cat states.\
            \ They succeeded in creating the quantum superpositions at temperatures\
            \ of up to 1.8 Kelvin -- which is sixty times hotter than the ambient\
            \ temperature in the cavity. \"Our results show that it is possible to\
            \ generate highly mixed quantum states with distinct quantum properties,\"\
            \ explains Ian Yang, who performed the experiments reported in the study.\
            \ \n The researchers used two special protocols to create the hot Schrödinger\
            \ cat states. These protocols were previously used to produce cat states\
            \ starting from the ground state of the system. \"It turned out that adapted\
            \ protocols also work at higher temperatures, generating distinct quantum\
            \ interferences,\" says Oriol Romero-Isart, until recently Professor of\
            \ Theoretical Physics at the University of Innsbruck and research group\
            \ leader at IQOQI Innsbruck and since 2024 Director of ICFO -- the Institute\
            \ of Photonic Sciences in Barcelona. \"This opens up new opportunities\
            \ for the creation and use of quantum superpositions, for example in nanomechanical\
            \ oscillators, for which achieving the ground state can be technically\
            \ challenging.\" \n \"Many of our colleagues were surprised when we first\
            \ told them about our results, because we usually think of temperature\
            \ as something that destroys quantum effects,\" adds Thomas Agrenius,\
            \ who helped develop the theoretical understanding of the experiment.\
            \ \"Our measurements confirm that quantum interference can persist even\
            \ at high temperature.\" \n These research findings could benefit the\
            \ development of quantum technologies. \"Our work reveals that it is possible\
            \ to observe and use quantum phenomena even in less ideal, warmer environments,\"\
            \ emphasizes Gerhard Kirchmair. \"If we can create the necessary interactions\
            \ in a system, the temperature ultimately doesn't matter.\" \n The study\
            \ was funded by the Austrian Research Fund FWF and the European Union,\

            \ with one common goal: creating a utility scale quantum computer. An\
            \ additional three companies are still in contract negotiations.  Joe\
            \ Altpeter, the program manager of DARPA's Defense Sciences Office, told\
            \ Nextgov/FCW that the initiative is broken up into three stages, each\
            \ with specific milestones that a given company’s technology must meet\
            \ to advance. “We really have built this to be an increasingly robust,\
            \ increasingly deep evaluation,” Altpeter said. “There’s like 12 different\
            \ technologies that are competing for this.” While there is some overlap\
            \ in how the 15 participating companies anticipate bringing a cryptographically-relevant\
            \ quantum computer to life — such as superconducting qubits, neutral atoms,\
            \ trapped ions and photonics — each company employs these techniques differently\
            \ to transmit data in superposition, a key feature of quantum computing.\
            \ Including this diverse array of companies is part of DARPA’s broader\
            \ goal to track multiple avenues for quantum supremacy.  When asked which\
            \ method will be the likely winner of the initiative, Altpeter said that\
            \ his inability to answer that question is the entire point of DARPA’s\
            \ program. “There's no reason to believe that the systems that even the\
            \ winning company has today are going to look anything like the systems\
            \ that they need to win this race 10 years from now, 20 years [from now],”\
            \ he said. “That's really what we're trying to do in the Quantum Benchmarking\
            \ Initiative, is do that deep technical dive and deep technical due diligence.”\
            \ Altpeter added that they aim to figure out what they should be tracking\
            \ now in order to get to that system that will change the world in 10\
            \ years. Participants within the Quantum Benchmarking Initiative begin\
            \ in Stage A, which launches a six-month tech sprint focused on deliverables.\
            \ The sprint will consist of three evaluations: explaining use cases,\
            \ identifying weak links in scaling procedures and answering a final evaluation\
            \ featuring 60 questions that will dictate if a company’s system advances.\
            \ “We ask them: ‘Which system eventually do you think is really going\
            \ to start to be industrially useful, which is the one where you're really\
            \ going to start making money on this technology? Why do you think that,\
            \ what does that system need to do?’” Altpeter said.  He said that despite\
            \ the relatively short timeframe of six months, Stage A’s parameters will\
            \ offer researchers a good idea of what technologies should move on to\
            \ Stage B in the next 12 months. The first participating companies in\
            \ Stage A include: \n Alice &amp; Bob \n Atlantic Quantum  \n Atom Computing \
            \ \n Diraq  \n Hewlett Packard Enterprise  \n IBM \n IonQ  \n Nord Quantique \
            \ \n Oxford Ionics \n Photonic Inc.  \n Quantinuum  \n Quantum Motion \
            \ \n Rigetti Computing  \n Silicon Quantum Computing Pty. Ltd. \n Xanadu \
            \ \n DARPA has explored the science needed for viable quantum computing\
            \ as well as its applications for several years now, with scalability\
            \ always being a leading priority. Along with the companies included in\
            \ the Quantum Benchmarking Initiative, the agency is working with Microsoft\
            \ and PsiQuantum in a similar collaboration to examine their quantum computing\
            \ methodology in greater detail."

            \ Breakthroughs, Challenges, and What Lies Ahead\n\nSeptember 5, 2024\\\
            |[Microtime Computers](https://microtime.com/author/marketingformsps/)\\\
            |\n\nQuantum computing (QC), once a theoretical concept confined to academic\
            \ research, has rapidly evolved into one of the most exciting and promising\
            \ fields in technology. As we move through 2024, QC is inching closer\
            \ to practical applications that could revolutionize industries from cryptography\
            \ to drug discovery. However, alongside these breakthroughs come significant\
            \ challenges that must be addressed before quantum computing can reach\
            \ its full potential. Let’s explore the latest developments in quantum\
            \ computing, the obstacles that remain, and what the future may hold for\
            \ this transformative technology.\n\n## Breakthroughs in Quantum Computing\
            \ in 2024\n\n2024 has been a year of significant progress in the field\
            \ of QC, with several key breakthroughs that are bringing us closer to\
            \ realizing its potential:\n\n**1\\. Increased Qubit Stability and Error\
            \ Correction**\n\nOne of the most critical challenges in quantum computing\
            \ has always been maintaining the stability of qubits—the basic units\
            \ of quantum information. In 2024, researchers have made notable advancements\
            \ in error correction techniques, which are essential for stabilizing\
            \ qubits and reducing the errors that occur during quantum computations.\
            \ Improved error correction codes and the development of more stable qubits,\
            \ such as topological qubits, have pushed the boundaries of what is possible,\
            \ bringing us closer to achieving reliable quantum computing.\n\n**2\\\
            . Quantum Supremacy Milestones**\n\nQuantum supremacy—the point at which\
            \ a quantum computer can solve a problem that classical computers cannot—has\
            \ been a hot topic in recent years. In 2024, several QC firms and research\
            \ institutions have announced new milestones in this area. While there\
            \ is still debate over what constitutes true quantum supremacy, the latest\
            \ demonstrations have shown quantum computers tackling increasingly complex\
            \ problems, outpacing their classical counterparts in specific tasks such\
            \ as complex simulations and optimization problems.\n\n**3\\. Advancements\
            \ in Quantum Algorithms**\n\nThe development of quantum algorithms has\
            \ seen significant progress in 2024. New algorithms designed to take advantage\
            \ of quantum computing’s unique capabilities are being developed, offering\
            \ the potential to solve problems in fields such as cryptography, materials\
            \ science, and machine learning more efficiently than ever before. For\
            \ instance, advances in quantum algorithms for factoring large numbers\
            \ have implications for breaking traditional encryption methods, a development\
            \ that could reshape the field of [cybersecurity](https://microtime.com/cybersecurity-services/).\n\
            \n**4\\. Commercial Quantum [Cloud Services](https://microtime.com/cloud-computing/)**\n\
            \nQuantum computing is gradually becoming more accessible, thanks to the\
            \ expansion of quantum [cloud services](https://microtime.com/cloud-computing/)\
            \ offered by tech giants such as IBM, Google, and Amazon. In 2024, these\
            \ platforms have introduced more powerful quantum processors, allowing\
            \ businesses and researchers to experiment with QC without needing to\
            \ build and maintain their own quantum hardware. These services are making\
            \ it easier for organizations to explore quantum computing applications\
            \ in a real-world context, accelerating innovation across industries.\n\
            \n## Challenges Facing Quantum Computing\n\nDespite these exciting breakthroughs,\
            \ significant challenges remain before quantum computing can be fully\
            \ realized and integrated into everyday use:\n\n**1\\. Scalability Issues**\n\
            \nWhile qubit stability has improved, scaling quantum computers to the\
            \ level necessary for solving large, complex problems remains a daunting\
            \ challenge. Building quantum computers with millions of qubits that can\
            \ operate reliably in tandem is still beyond our current capabilities.\
            \ As researchers work to overcome these scalability issues, the goal of\
            \ creating large-scale quantum computers remains on the horizon.\n\n**2\\\
            . Quantum Error Correction**\n\nAlthough error correction has improved,\
            \ it is not yet at the level required for fully fault-tolerant QC. Quantum\
            \ systems are inherently susceptible to noise and decoherence, which can\
            \ introduce errors into computations. Developing more efficient and effective\
            \ error correction methods is essential for the future of quantum computing,\
            \ and remains an active area of research in 2024.\n\n**3\\. Hardware Limitations**\n\
            \nThe physical construction of quantum computers presents significant\
            \ engineering challenges. Quantum processors need to operate at extremely\
            \ low temperatures, close to absolute zero, and are highly sensitive to\
            \ environmental disturbances. Maintaining the delicate balance required\
            \ for quantum operations is difficult, and building robust, reliable quantum\
            \ hardware that can function outside of highly controlled laboratory environments\
            \ is still a major hurdle.\n\n**4\\. Security Concerns**\n\nThe potential\
            \ of QC to break current cryptographic systems is both a promise and a\
            \ threat. As quantum computers become more powerful, they could render\
            \ many of the encryption methods that secure today’s digital communications\
            \ obsolete. This has led to a race to develop quantum-resistant cryptography,\
            \ but widespread adoption is still years away. The looming threat of quantum-enabled\
            \ cyberattacks is a significant concern for governments and industries\
            \ worldwide.\n\n**5\\. High Costs and Accessibility**\n\nQuantum computing\
            \ technology remains expensive, and the expertise required to work with\
            \ quantum systems is still relatively rare. This limits access to QC for\
            \ many businesses and researchers, particularly smaller organizations\
            \ without the resources to invest in cutting-edge technology. While quantum\
            \ [cloud services](https://microtime.com/cloud-computing/) are helping\
            \ to bridge this gap, the costs and complexity of quantum computing remain\
            \ barriers to widespread adoption.\n\n## What Lies Ahead for QC\n\nAs\
            \ we look to the future, the road ahead for quantum computing is both\
            \ challenging and full of potential. Here are some key developments to\
            \ watch for in the coming years:\n\n**1\\. Quantum-Classical Hybrid Systems**\n\
            \nOne of the most promising directions for QC is the development of quantum-classical\
            \ hybrid systems. These systems combine the strengths of classical computing\
            \ with the unique capabilities of quantum processors, allowing for more\
            \ efficient problem-solving. In the near term, we are likely to see more\
            \ hybrid approaches that leverage quantum computing for specific tasks\
            \ while relying on classical computing for others.\n\n**2\\. Quantum Networking\
            \ and the Quantum Internet**\n\nQuantum networking, which involves connecting\
            \ quantum computers over long distances, is an emerging field with the\
            \ potential to revolutionize communication and data sharing. The concept\
            \ of a quantum internet, where quantum information is transmitted securely\
            \ over vast distances, is still in its early stages but could become a\
            \ reality within the next decade. This would open up new possibilities\
            \ for secure communication, distributed quantum computing, and more.\n\
            \n**3\\. Wider Industry Adoption**\n\nAs quantum computing technology\
            \ matures and becomes more accessible, we can expect to see broader adoption\
            \ across various industries. Sectors such as finance, healthcare, energy,\
            \ and logistics are likely to be early adopters, using QC to optimize\
            \ processes, develop new materials, and solve complex logistical challenges.\
            \ The potential applications are vast, and as businesses begin to see\
            \ tangible benefits from QC, its adoption will accelerate.\n\n**4\\. Ongoing\
            \ Research and Development**\n\nThe future of QC will be shaped by ongoing\
            \ research and development efforts. Governments, academic institutions,\
            \ and private companies are investing heavily in quantum research, with\
            \ the goal of overcoming current challenges and unlocking the full potential\
            \ of this technology. As breakthroughs continue to occur, we will move\
            \ closer to the realization of quantum computing’s promise.\n\nAs we look\
            \ ahead, the continued advancement of quantum computing will depend on\
            \ the collaboration between researchers, engineers, and businesses. The\
            \ journey to fully functional QC is still in its early stages, but the\
            \ progress made in 2024 demonstrates that the quantum revolution is well\
            \ underway. By staying informed and engaged with the [developments](https://www.localitcompanies.com/boston-ma/)\
            \ in this field, businesses and individuals alike can prepare for the\
            \ transformative impact that quantum computing is set to have on the world.\n\

          url: https://thequantuminsider.com/2024/12/25/its-starting-to-look-a-lot-like-quantum-unwrap-the-top-10-quantum-research-stories-of-2024/
          published_date: N/A
          text: "\n \n As 2024 wraps up, it’s impossible not to marvel at the sheer\
            \ scope of quantum discoveries we’ve witnessed this year. From developments\
            \ in quantum chemistry to incremental movement towards the ever-elusive\
            \ fault-tolerant computing, the field has pushed boundaries in ways that\
            \ were science fiction just yesteryear. \n Pulling together a list of\
            \ the top research stories is no trivial task—the quantum universe does\
            \ not go gently into a single post. Many deserving moments are not listed\
            \ here, but that’s the nature of gift-giving: what fits under the tree\
            \ is unfortunately bound by classical constraints. \n It’s important to\
            \ note that this list is not exhaustive and leans toward application-based\
            \ research rather than hardware developments (or else Microsoft’s logical\
            \ qubits and Google’s Willow would have certainly made the roundup). It\
            \ reflects stories that resonated notably–a curated collection of quantum\
            \ highlights, with a little nod to the community for helping shape the\
            \ narrative through your clicks, shares, and conversations. \n And now\
            \ for the always anticipated unboxing: \n Microsoft Integrates HPC, Quantum\
            \ Computing, and AI for Chemical Reactions Study \n \n Microsoft integrated\
            \ HPC, quantum computing, and AI on the Azure Quantum Elements platform\
            \ to study catalytic reactions, exploring applications of quantum simulations\
            \ in quantum chemistry. \n \n What Happened: Researchers conducted over\
            \ one million density functional theory (DFT) calculations to map chemical\
            \ reaction networks, identifying more than 3,000 unique molecular configurations.\
            \ Quantum simulations using logical qubits and error-correction techniques\
            \ refined results where classical methods encountered limitations. \n\
            \ \n \n Key Findings: Encoded quantum computations achieved chemical accuracy\
            \ (0.15 milli-Hartree error), surpassing the performance of unencoded\
            \ methods. \n \n \n Significance: The study illustrates the potential\
            \ of logical qubits in improving the reliability of quantum calculations,\
            \ a necessary step toward scaling quantum chemistry applications. Future\
            \ efforts will focus on enhancing error correction methods and improving\
            \ algorithmic scalability. \n \n Quantinuum Unveils First Contribution\
            \ Toward Responsible AI — Uniting Power of Its Quantum Processors With\
            \ Experimental Work on Integrating Classical, Quantum Computing \n \n\
            \ Quantinuum implemented a scalable Quantum Natural Language Processing\
            \ (QNLP) model, QDisCoCirc, utilizing quantum computing to address text-based\
            \ tasks such as question answering. This work explores the integration\
            \ of quantum computing and AI, with an emphasis on interpretability and\
            \ scalability. \n \n What Happened: Researchers developed QDisCoCirc using\
            \ compositional generalization, a technique inspired by category theory,\
            \ to process text into smaller, interpretable components. The approach\
            \ addressed challenges like the “barren plateau” problem, which complicates\
            \ the scaling of quantum models, and demonstrated the model’s ability\

            # Two advances in quantum error correction share the _Physics World_ 2024
            Breakthrough of the Year


            19 Dec 2024 [Hamish Johnston](https://physicsworld.com/author/hamish-johnston/)


            [![](https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Breakthrough-of-the-year.jpg)](https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Breakthrough-of-the-year.jpg)


            The _Physics World_ 2024 Breakthrough of the Year goes to [Mikhail Lukin](https://www.physics.harvard.edu/people/facpages/lukin), [Dolev
            Bluvstein](https://lukin.physics.harvard.edu/people/dolev-bluvstein) and
            colleagues at Harvard University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology
            and [QuEra Computing](https://www.quera.com/), and independently to [Hartmut
            Neven](https://research.google/people/hartmutneven/) and colleagues at [Google
            Quantum AI](https://quantumai.google/) and their collaborators, for [demonstrating
            quantum error correction on an atomic processor with 48 logical qubits](https://physicsworld.com/a/quantum-processor-integrates-48-logical-qubits/),
            and for [implementing quantum error correction below the surface code
            threshold](https://physicsworld.com/a/quantum-processor-enters-unprecedented-territory-for-error-correction/) in
            a superconducting chip, respectively.


            Errors caused by interactions with the environment – noise – are the Achilles
            heel of every quantum computer, and correcting them has been called a
            “ [defining challenge](https://physicsworld.com/a/why-error-correction-is-quantum-computings-defining-challenge/)”
            for the technology. These two teams, working with very different quantum
            systems, took significant steps towards overcoming this challenge. In
            doing so, they made it far more likely that quantum computers will become
            practical problem-solving machines, not just noisy, intermediate-scale
            tools for scientific research.


            Quantum error correction works by distributing one quantum bit of information
            – called a logical qubit – across several different physical qubits such
            as superconducting circuits or trapped atoms. While each physical qubit
            is noisy, they work together to preserve the quantum state of the logical
            qubit – at least for long enough to do a computation.


            ### Formidable task


            Error correction should become more effective as the number of physical
            qubits in a logical qubit increases. However, integrating large numbers
            of physical qubits to create a processor with multiple logical qubits
            is a formidable task. Furthermore, adding more physical qubits to a logical
            qubit also adds more noise – and it is not clear whether making logical
            qubits bigger would make them significantly better. This year’s winners
            of our Breakthrough of the Year have made significant progress in addressing
            these issues.


            The team led by Lukin and Bluvstein created a quantum processor with 48
            logical qubits that can execute algorithms while correcting errors in
            real time. At the heart of their processor are arrays of neutral atoms.
            These are grids of ultracold rubidium atoms trapped by optical tweezers.
            These atoms can be put into highly excited Rydberg states, which enables
            the atoms to act as physical qubits that can exchange quantum information.


            What is more, the atoms can be moved about within an array to entangle
            them with other atoms. According to Bluvstein, moving groups of atoms
            around the processor was critical for their success at addressing a major
            challenge in using logical qubits: how to get logical qubits to interact
            with each other to perform quantum operations. He describes the system
            as a “living organism that changes during a computation”.


            Their processor used about 300 physical qubits to create up to 48 logical
            qubits, which were used to perform logical operations. In contrast, similar
            attempts using superconducting or trapped-ion qubits have only managed
            to perform logical operations using 1–3 logical qubits.


            ### Willow quantum processor


            Meanwhile, the team led by Hartmut Neven made a significant advance in
            how physical qubits can be combined to create a logical qubit. Using Google’s
            new Willow quantum processor – which offers up to 105 superconducting
            physical qubits – they showed that the noise in their logical qubit remained
            below a maximum threshold as they increased the number of qubits.  This
            means that the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as the number
            of physical qubits per logical qubit is increased.


            Neven told _Physics World_ that the Google system is “the most convincing
            prototype of a logical qubit built today”. He said that that Google is
            on track to develop a quantum processor with 100 or even 1000 logical
            qubits by 2030. He says that a 1000 logical qubit device could do useful
            calculations for the development of new drugs or new materials for batteries.


            Bluvstein, Lukin and colleagues are already exploring how their processor
            could be used to study an effect called quantum scrambling. This could
            shed light on properties of black holes and even provide important clues
            about the nature of quantum gravity.


            You can listen to Neven talk about his team’s research [in this podcast](https://physicsworld.com/a/hartmut-neven-talks-about-google-quantum-ais-breakthrough-in-quantum-error-correction/).

            are listed below in no particular order.


            ## [Light-absorbing dye turns skin of live mouse transparent](https://physicsworld.com/a/light-absorbing-dye-turns-skin-of-a-live-mouse-transparent/)


            [![Zihao Ou holds a vial of the common yellow food dye tartrazine in solution](https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Low-Res_Zihao-Ou-Lab-1a.jpg)](https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Low-Res_Zihao-Ou-Lab-1a.jpg)
            **Achieving optical transparency** First author Zihao Ou holds a vial
            of the common yellow food dye tartrazine in solution. By applying a mixture
            of water and tartrazine, Ou and colleagues made the skin on the skulls
            and abdomens of live mice transparent. (Courtesy: University of Texas
            at Dallas)


            To a team of researchers at Stanford University in the US for developing
            a method to make the [skin of live mice temporarily transparent](https://physicsworld.com/a/light-absorbing-dye-turns-skin-of-a-live-mouse-transparent/).
            One of the challenges of imaging biological tissue using optical techniques
            is that tissue scatters light, which makes it opaque. The team, led by [Zihao
            Ou](https://profiles.utdallas.edu/zihao.ou) (now at The University of
            Texas at Dallas), [Mark Brongersma](https://mse.stanford.edu/people/mark-brongersma) and [Guosong
            Hong](https://mse.stanford.edu/people/guosong-hong), found that the common
            yellow food dye tartrazine strongly absorbs near-ultraviolet and blue
            light and can help make biological tissue transparent. Applying the dye
            onto the abdomen, scalp and hindlimbs of live mice enabled the researchers
            to see internal organs, such as the liver, small intestine and bladder,
            through the skin without requiring any surgery. They could also visualize
            blood flow in the rodents’ brains and the fine structure of muscle sarcomere
            fibres in their hind limbs. The effect can be reversed by simply rinsing
            off the dye. This “optical clearing” technique has so far only been conducted
            on animals. But if extended to humans, it could help make some types of
            invasive biopsies a thing of the past.


            ## [Laser cooling positronium](https://physicsworld.com/a/matter-antimatter-gas-of-positronium-is-laser-cooled/)


            To the [AEgIS](http://aegis.web.cern.ch/aegis/home.html) collaboration
            at CERN, and [Kosuke Yoshioka](https://www.u-tokyo.ac.jp/focus/en/people/people000810.html) and
            colleagues at the University of Tokyo, for independently demonstrating [laser
            cooling of positronium](https://physicsworld.com/a/matter-antimatter-gas-of-positronium-is-laser-cooled/).
            Positronium, an atom-like bound state of an electron and a positron, is
            created in the lab to allow physicists to study antimatter. Currently,
            it is created in “warm” clouds in which the atoms have a large distribution
            of velocities, making precision spectroscopy difficult. Cooling positronium
            to low temperatures could open up novel ways to study the properties of
            antimatter. It also enables researchers to produce one to two orders of
            magnitude more antihydrogen – an antiatom comprising a positron and an
            antiproton that’s of great interest to physicists. The research also paves
            the way to use positronium to test current aspects of the Standard Model
            of particle physics, such as quantum electrodynamics, which predicts specific
            spectral lines, and to probe the effects of gravity on antimatter.


            ## [Modelling lung cells to personalize radiotherapy](https://physicsworld.com/a/modelling-lung-cells-could-help-personalize-radiotherapy/)


            To [Roman Bauer](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/roman-bauer) at the University
            of Surrey, UK, [Marco Durante](https://www.gsi.de/en/work/research/biophysics/team_details?no_cache=1&name=durante&vorname=marco) from
            the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research, Germany, and [Nicolò
            Cogno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nicol%C3%B2cogno/) from GSI and Massachusetts
            General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, US, for [creating a computational
            model](https://physicsworld.com/a/modelling-lung-cells-could-help-personalize-radiotherapy/) that
            could improve radiotherapy outcomes for patients with lung cancer. Radiotherapy
            is an effective treatment for lung cancer but can harm healthy tissue.
            To minimize radiation damage and help personalize treatment, the team
            combined a model of lung tissue with a Monte Carlo simulator to simulate
            irradiation of alveoli (the tiny air sacs within the lungs) at microscopic
            and nanoscopic scales. Based on the radiation dose delivered to each cell
            and its distribution, the model predicts whether each cell will live or
            die, and determines the severity of radiation damage hours, days, months
            or even years after treatment. Importantly, the researchers found that
            their model delivered results that matched experimental observations from
            various labs and hospitals, suggesting that it could, in principle, be
            used within a clinical setting.


            ## A [semiconductor](https://physicsworld.com/a/graphene-based-semiconductor-has-a-useful-bandgap-and-high-electron-mobility/) and [a
            novel switch](https://physicsworld.com/a/graphene-switch-combines-logic-and-memory-functions-in-a-single-device/) made
            from graphene


            [![Epigraphene](https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Epigraphene.jpg)](https://physicsworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Epigraphene.jpg)

            To [Walter de Heer](https://physics.gatech.edu/user/walter-de-heer), [Lei
            Ma](https://ticnn.tju.edu.cn/people.htm) and colleagues at Tianjin University
            and the Georgia Institute of Technology, and independently to [Marcelo
            Lozada-Hidalgo](https://research.manchester.ac.uk/en/persons/marcelo.lozadahidalgo) of
            the University of Manchester and a multinational team of colleagues, for [creating
            a functional semiconductor made from graphene](https://physicsworld.com/a/graphene-based-semiconductor-has-a-useful-bandgap-and-high-electron-mobility/),
            and for using graphene to [make a switch that supports both memory and
            logic functions](https://physicsworld.com/a/graphene-switch-combines-logic-and-memory-functions-in-a-single-device/),
            respectively. The Manchester-led team’s achievement was to harness graphene’s
            ability to conduct both protons and electrons in a device that performs
            logic operations with a proton current while simultaneously encoding a
            bit of memory with an electron current. These functions are normally performed
            by separate circuit elements, which increases data transfer times and
            power consumption. Conversely, de Heer, Ma and colleagues engineered a
            form of graphene that does not conduct as easily. Their new “epigraphene”
            has a bandgap that, like silicon, could allow it to be made into a transistor,
            but with favourable properties that silicon lacks, such as high thermal
            conductivity.


            ## [Detecting the decay of individual nuclei](https://physicsworld.com/a/physicists-detect-nuclear-decay-in-the-recoil-of-a-levitating-sphere/)


            To [David Moore](https://physics.yale.edu/people/david-moore), [Jiaxiang
            Wang](https://physics.yale.edu/people/jiaxiang-wang) and colleagues at
            Yale University, US, for [detecting the nuclear decay of individual helium
            nuclei](https://physicsworld.com/a/physicists-detect-nuclear-decay-in-the-recoil-of-a-levitating-sphere/) by
            embedding radioactive lead-212 atoms in a micron-sized silica sphere and
            measuring the sphere’s recoil as nuclei escape from it. Their technique
            relies on the conservation of momentum, and it can gauge forces as small
            as 10-20 N and accelerations as tiny as 10-7 _g_, where _g_ is the local
            acceleration due to the Earth’s gravitational pull. The researchers hope
            that a similar technique may one day be used to detect neutrinos, which
            are much less massive than helium nuclei but are likewise emitted as decay
            products in certain nuclear reactions.


            ## [Two distinct descriptions of nuclei unified for the first time](https://physicsworld.com/a/two-distinct-descriptions-of-nuclei-unified-for-the-first-time/)


            To [Andrew Denniston](https://www.hen-lab.com/people) at the Massachusetts
            Institute of Technology in the US, [Tomáš Ježo](https://www.uni-muenster.de/Physik.TP/en/institute/members/tomas_jezo.html) at
            Germany’s University of Münster and an international team for being the
            first to [unify two distinct descriptions of atomic nuclei](https://physicsworld.com/a/two-distinct-descriptions-of-nuclei-unified-for-the-first-time/).
            They have combined the particle physics perspective – where nuclei comprise
            quarks and gluons – with the traditional nuclear physics view that treats
            nuclei as collections of interacting nucleons (protons and neutrons).
            The team has provided fresh insights into short-range correlated nucleon
            pairs – which are fleeting interactions where two nucleons come exceptionally
            close and engage in strong interactions for mere femtoseconds. The model
            was tested and refined using experimental data from scattering experiments
            involving 19 different nuclei with very different masses (from helium-3
            to lead-208). The work represents a major step forward in our understanding
            of nuclear structure and strong interactions.


            ## [New titanium:sapphire laser is tiny, low-cost and tuneable](https://physicsworld.com/a/new-titaniumsapphire-laser-is-tiny-low-cost-and-tuneable/)


            To [Jelena Vučković](https://web.stanford.edu/~jela/), Joshua Yang, [Kasper
            Van Gasse](https://profiles.stanford.edu/kasper-van-gasse), [Daniil Lukin](https://profiles.stanford.edu/daniil-lukin),
            and colleagues at Stanford University in the US for developing a [compact,
            integrated titanium:sapphire laser](https://physicsworld.com/a/new-titaniumsapphire-laser-is-tiny-low-cost-and-tuneable/) that
            needs only a simple green LED as a pump source. They have reduced the
            cost and footprint of a titanium:sapphire laser by three orders of magnitude
            and the power consumption by two. Traditional titanium:sapphire lasers
            have to be pumped with high-powered lasers – and therefore cost in excess
            of $100,000. In contrast, the team was able to pump its device using a
            $37 green laser diode. The researchers also achieved two things that had
            not been possible before with a titanium:sapphire laser. They were able
            to adjust the wavelength of the laser light and they were able to create
            a titanium:sapphire laser amplifier. Their device represents a key step
            towards the democratization of a laser type that plays important roles
            in scientific research and industry.


            ## Entangled photons [conceal](https://physicsworld.com/a/researchers-exploit-quantum-entanglement-to-create-hidden-images/) and [enhance](https://physicsworld.com/a/entangled-photons-enhance-adaptive-optical-imaging/) images


            To two related teams for their clever use of entangled photons in imaging.
            Both groups include [Chloé Vernière and Hugo Defienne](https://quantumimagingparis.fr/team/) of
            Sorbonne University in France, who as duo [used quantum entanglement to
            encode an image into a beam of light](https://physicsworld.com/a/researchers-exploit-quantum-entanglement-to-create-hidden-images/).
            The impressive thing is that the image is only visible to an observer
            using a single-photon sensitive camera – otherwise the image is hidden
            from view. The technique could be used to create optical systems with
            reduced sensitivity to scattering. This could be useful for imaging biological
            tissues and long-range optical communications. In separate work, Vernière
            and Defienne teamed up with [Patrick Cameron](https://www.physics.gla.ac.uk/xtremeLight/Patrick.html) at
            the UK’s University of Glasgow and others to [use entangled photons to
            enhance adaptive optical imaging](https://physicsworld.com/a/entangled-photons-enhance-adaptive-optical-imaging/).
            The team showed that the technique can be used to produce higher-resolution
            images than conventional bright-field microscopy. Looking to the future,
            this adaptive optics technique could play a major role in the development
            of quantum microscopes.


            ## [First samples returned from the Moon’s far side](https://physicsworld.com/a/china-launches-change-6-mission-to-return-samples-from-the-moons-far-side/)


            To the [China National Space Administration](https://www.cnsa.gov.cn/english/) for
            the first-ever retrieval of material from the Moon’s far side, confirming
            China as one of the world’s leading space nations. Landing on the lunar
            far side – which always faces away from Earth – is difficult due to its
            distance and terrain of giant craters with few flat surfaces. At the same
            time, scientists are interested in the unexplored far side and why it
            looks so different from the near side. [The Chang’e-6 mission was launched
            on 3 May](https://physicsworld.com/a/china-launches-change-6-mission-to-return-samples-from-the-moons-far-side/) consisting
            of four parts: an ascender, lander, returner and orbiter. The ascender
            and lander successfully touched down on 1 June in the Apollo basin, which
            lies in the north-eastern side of the South Pole-Aitken Basin. The lander
            used its robotic scoop and drill to obtain about 1.9 kg of materials within
            48 h. The ascender then lifted off from the top of the lander and docked
            with the returner-orbiter before the returner headed back to Earth, landing
            in Inner Mongolia on 25 June. In November, scientists released [the first
            results](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt1093) from the
            mission finding that fragments of basalt – a type of volcanic rock – [date
            back to 2.8 billion years ago](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08382-0),
            indicating that the lunar far side was volcanically active at that time.
            Further scientific discoveries can be expected in the coming months and
            years ahead as scientists analyze more fragments.

            Quantum computing made significant strides in 2024, but it’s yet to demonstrate
            a practical advantage over classical digital computers, according to a
            recent trends report released by [Forrester Research](https://go.forrester.com/).


            “Despite improvements in qubit count, coherence time, and gate fidelity,
            the technology remains experimental, with broad-scale applications likely
            still a decade away,” maintained the report written by Forrester Vice

            “Key developments in optimization, quantum simulation, and quantum machine
            learning show promise for specific industries like finance and pharmaceuticals,
            yet challenges such as high error rates and scalability persist,” the
            analysts added.


            [Roger A. Grimes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rogeragrimes/), author of
            “Cryptography Apocalypse: Preparing for the Day When Quantum Computing
            Breaks Today’s Crypto,” published by Wiley, acknowledged that practical,
            usable quantum computers haven’t made a public appearance yet, but some
            useful applications of quantum have been deployed, such as quantum random
            number generators, networks, sensors, and all sorts of other devices.


            “No one has publicly shown a problem solved by a quantum computer that
            is super usable in the real world,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Today, your
            wristwatch has more power than what we have in quantum computers. But
            that is changing. We are making steady progress, and the day when quantum
            computers turn into sufficiently-capable quantum computers is not far
            away.”


            ### Quantum Solving Problems Now


            Trevor Lanting, chief development officer at D-Wave Systems in Vancouver,
            B.C., Canada, agreed that gate-model quantum computing has not yet demonstrated
            a practical quantum advantage but pointed out that annealing quantum computing
            is delivering value over classical computing today.


            Gate-model quantum computers use quantum logic gates to perform operations
            on qubits, similar to how classical computers use logic gates to perform
            operations with digital bits. The gate model is more suitable for general-purpose
            computing, while annealing quantum computing is more narrowly focused
            on optimization problems, such as workforce scheduling and portfolio optimization.


            D-Wave has been using annealing quantum technology in a hybrid solution
            to solve complex optimization problems. For example, it was able to optimize
            the mobile network resources of Japan’s largest telecom provider, NTT
            Docomo, in 40 seconds, compared to 27 hours using classical methods.


            Forrester’s report predicted that gate-based quantum computing platforms
            will likely remain experimental for 10 to 15 years, a prediction that
            Lanting agrees with. “However, annealing quantum computing — which is
            uniquely suited for solving complex optimization problems — is here now,”
            he told TechNewsWorld.


            “Optimization problems are everywhere — from workforce scheduling to vehicle
            routing — and D-Wave’s annealing quantum computers are already delivering
            measurable results for customers,” he said.


            Lanting maintained that D-Wave’s technology helped Pattison Food Group,
            a Canadian grocery chain, reduce an 80-hour scheduling task to just 15
            hours — an 80% time savings — and at the Port of Los Angeles, working
            with SavantX, cargo handling efficiency was improved by 60%.


            “These aren’t theoretical use cases,” he said. “They’re real businesses
            solving real problems right now with quantum and hybrid quantum computing.”


            ### Optimization Apps Will Lead Way


            While D-Wave’s annealing platform has been touted by the company for years
            as superior to gate-based solutions for optimization problems, Forrester
            pointed out that those claims were challenged in 2024.


            “ [Q-CTRL](https://q-ctrl.com) has challenged D-Wave’s claim by using
            IBM’s gate-based quantum computers to outperform D-Wave for an optimization
            problem,” the analysts wrote. “Gate-based algorithms offer the potential
            for greater solution speedups as qubit counts and quality increase.”


            “This makes Q-CTRL’s claim an interesting challenge to D-Wave’s self-proclaimed
            lead in optimization,” they continued.


            Optimization is an important application for quantum computing because
            it matters to most industries, Forrester noted. “For finance, representative
            areas include risk modeling, trading strategy optimization, asset pricing
            optimization, and portfolio optimization,” it explained.


            “Health care use cases include optimizing radiotherapy treatments, generating
            targeted cancer drug therapies, and creating protein models,” it added.
            “And for energy, use cases include energy exploration, seismic survey
            optimization, reserve and spot trading optimization, and reservoir optimization.”


            In the near term, if quantum is going to go beyond experimentation and
            generate a return on investment for users, it’s going to be through optimization
            tools, explained Erik Garcell, director of quantum enterprise development
            for North America for [Classiq](https://www.classiq.io), a global quantum
            computer software maker.


            “Optimization offers more near-term benefits because it scales so well
            on quantum computers,” he told TechNewsWorld. “Even having a few quantum
            resources, you know, 100 qubits on your quantum chip, means a lot for
            that kind of problem.”


            “The bigger the problem, the harder it is for a classical computer to
            solve,” he continued, “but that many more resources aren’t needed for
            a quantum computer because of how it scales. So, you’re going to actually
            see applications in quantum for very large optimization problems that
            are causing classical computers to chug.”


            ### Quantum Machine Learning Shows Signs of Life


            Grimes, though, contends focusing on optimization can be too limiting
            for quantum. “Optimization completely rules out the chances of brand-new
            advancements,” he said. “I’m not sure if quantum is like the AI world,
            but it is getting the same sort of feel.”


            “It really feels like we are possibly on the cusp of tremendous, sudden
            improvement,” he continued. “There are so many organizations making steady
            improvement. It seems strange to me to think that not one of those vendors
            out of the thousands wouldn’t make a substantial breakthrough.”


            Another 2024 quantum breakthrough cited by the Forrester analysts is the
            emergence of quantum machine learning. They explained that quantum-as-a-service
            (QaaS) has expanded access to quantum computing, enabling breakthroughs
            in quantum machine learning. Researchers are now developing quantum neural
            networks, quantum support vector machines, and quantum algorithms for
            complex tasks like image and natural language processing.


            “These advancements are pushing the boundaries of what machine learning
            can achieve, making it a critical area of growth,” they wrote.


            [![Real insights from the largest CX dataset](https://www.ectnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/nice-q125-970x250-statecxrpt.jpg)](https://www.technewsworld.com/story/quantum-computing-remains-experimental-despite-2024-advances-forrester-179514.html)


            Training AI models on classical computers is time-intensive and computationally
            expensive, especially with deep learning networks, observed Skip Sanzeri,
            co-founder and COO of [QuSecure](https://www.qusecure.com), a maker of
            quantum-safe security solutions, in San Mateo, Calif.


            “Using an algorithm like the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm,
            along with other quantum enhancements like gradient descent, could speed
            up the training of machine learning models by orders of magnitude,” he
            told TechNewsWorld.


            Sanzeri also pointed out that AI on classical systems is not exponentially
            scalable, so classical machines tend to struggle with combinatorial problems
            like optimization. “Since quantum computers are exponential in nature,
            they will be able to handle these combinatorial problems much better,”
            he explained.


            Quantum algorithms can also be used to process and analyze large data
            sets more efficiently using the Quantum Fourier Transform, leading to
            faster insights and real-time decision-making, he noted.


            Generative AI models, too, can be challenging for classical computing
            systems, he added. “Superposition and entanglement — quantum properties
            — can be used to generate data distributions more efficiently and accurately,”
            he said.


            ### Preparation for Quantum Threats Becoming Urgent


            As quantum advances push the boundaries of what machine learning can achieve,
            they’re also driving a focus on quantum security. “With NIST \[the U.S.
            Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology\]
            setting standards for quantum-resistant algorithms, the need to safeguard
            data against future quantum threats is becoming more urgent,” the Forrester
            analysts wrote.


            They added that cryptography and machine learning hold substantial potential,
            but their benefits remain years away. Shor’s algorithm could one day break
            today’s PKI cryptography, they noted, although this is likely a decade
            or more in the future.


            Sanzeri disagreed with Forrester. “With the use of ever increasingly powerful
            AI, combined with other breakthroughs in the quantum computing industry
            — like [Google’s Willow chip](https://www.technewsworld.com/story/googles-willow-chip-has-quantum-developers-weeping-with-joy-179499.html)
            — we could see that 10-year time frame getting cut in half,” he argued.


            Meanwhile, Grimes cautioned that government intelligence agencies working
            to break quantum-susceptible encryption don’t need a fully-capable quantum
            computer to break today’s cryptography. “They will make quantum devices
            that are specialized in breaking encryption, just like they do with today’s
            regular non-quantum encryption breaking,” he said.


            “The NSA isn’t using laptops, servers, and regular cloud computing to
            break crypto,” he continued. “They use specialized crypto-devices, maximized
            for crypto-breaking efficiency. Certainly, they are doing the exact same
            thing with quantum cracking. It would be insane to do anything else if
            I was in their shoes.”


            [![Top Analysts Reveal How Al-Powered CX Delivers Business Results](https://www.ectnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/nice-q125-970x250-rlzdtop10.jpg)](https://www.technewsworld.com/story/quantum-computing-remains-experimental-despite-2024-advances-forrester-179514.html)


            He also warned about using [Shor’s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm),
            created in 1994, as a benchmark for what kind of quantum power is needed
            to crack PKI cryptography. “I think there is a good chance that the U.S.
            government has access to another algorithm that is far more efficient
            than Shor’s,” he contended. “If you’re fixated on Shor as the standard
            to meet, you’re probably not focused on the right algorithm.”


            Even if a quantum solution that can crack PKI is 10 years away, the time
            to act on that possibility is now, declared Tomas Gustavsson, chief PKI
            officer at [Keyfactor](https://www.keyfactor.com), a digital identity
            management company, in Cleveland. “A decade is a short time for this type
            of migration, as it is an immense undertaking,” he told TechNewsWorld.


            “We need to act now for the migration to be completed in a decade. Organizations
            must not start in a decade,” Gustavsson said. “So, when saying that a
            practical Shor’s algorithm is at least a decade away, Forrester is reiterating
            what NIST and others are saying. I also hope it’s at least a decade away.
            If not, we are in trouble.”


            ### Winter of Quantum Investor Discontent?


            Despite quantum’s promise, Forrester predicts a “winter” setting in on
            investment in the technology. “Although the number of quantum computing
            deals hit a record in 2023, investment dollar totals peaked in 2021 and
            have declined sharply since as generative AI excitement has claimed investor
            funding,” Forrester’s analysts wrote.


            They added that geopolitical pressures, like vendors in China transferring
            their IP to academia, are also at play. “This will put pressure on startups,
            causing many to seek exits with little to show,” they noted.


            On the plus side, the investment winter will delay the time when quantum
            computing platforms become powerful enough for mainstream use, which means
            a delay of Y2Q: the day when quantum computers break state-of-the-art
            asymmetric cryptography, the analysts reasoned.


            However, they warned about procrastinating about Y2Q. Although this development
            may buy more time to implement post-quantum encryption, they urged security
            leaders to begin planning now on how to protect against “harvest now,
            decrypt later” vulnerabilities, where encrypted data is gobbled up by
            adversaries now with an eye on decrypting it later with a quantum computer.


            [![5 Ways CX Leaders Differentiate for Big Results](https://www.ectnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2025/01/nice-q125-970x250-statecxinfog.jpg)](https://www.technewsworld.com/story/quantum-computing-remains-experimental-despite-2024-advances-forrester-179514.html)


            Forrester’s glum weather forecast isn’t shared by everyone. Growth estimates
            for the quantum computing market by industry forecasters range from a
            low CAGR of 27.04% over the next eight years to a high CAGR of 32.7% over
            the next five years, growing from slightly over a billion dollar market
            in 2024 to US$6.95 billion to $16.22 billion market in the early 2030s.


            “We would not expect a quantum winter but may see the same level of investment
            or increased investment in 2025,” Sanzeri predicted. “There has been significant
            progress in quantum computing in 2024 with some breakthroughs that are
            fundamental. We cannot find a reason why there would be at least the same
            level of investment in 2025 as in 2024.”


            “The recent relative downturn in quantum investment is really just a factor
            of the original, overstated quantum hype dying down at the same time as
            AI took off,” added Grimes. “Quantum will have plenty of investment, and
            as the steady improvements turn into sufficiently-capable quantum computers,
            the needed investment will flood back. I’m not concerned.”

            Computing Advances in 2024 Put Security In Spotlight


            The work on quantum computing hit some major milestones in 2024, making
            the path to a workable quantum computer seem closer than ever. Google,
            Microsoft, and other research efforts hit significant milestones this
            year, but is the cybersecurity world ready?

            The quest to create a useful quantum computer reached a significant milestone
            at the end of 2024 with Google''s announcement of its Willow chip. The
            chip promises reduced noise and fewer errors as the number of qubits grows
            — a necessary step to advance toward advanced quantum computing. Despite
            some debate on when these systems will actually become available, [experts
            still advise making plans](https://www.darkreading.com/endpoint-security/nist-releases-3-post-quantum-standards-urges-orgs-to-start-pqc-journey)
            and migrating to post-quantum technologies.


            The shift from today''s technology, where adding more qubits adds more
            noise, to a future where increasing the number of qubits exponentially
            reduces the amount of noise — an achievement known as "threshold scalability"
            — conquers a major impediment to quantum computers. Creating a 1,000-qubit
            quantum computer requires [foundational advancements](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2023/06/21/microsoft-achieves-first-milestone-towards-a-quantum-supercomputer/)
            beyond today''s noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers to create
            reliable logical qubits that can be used in easily scaled architectures.


            The Google announcement marks "a significant leap forward," says Karl
            Holmqvist, founder and CEO at Lastwall, an identity services provider
            focused on quantum resilience.


            "Companies should be starting to get concerned about a usable quantum
            computer now," Holmqvist says. "This is not because there is proof of
            a cryptographically relevant quantum computer yet. It is because there
            are active campaigns that are currently taking place to capture encrypted
            data and store it until there is a system that can break our asymmetric
            encryption."

            The threat posed by quantum computers seems to be becoming more real every
            day. In addition to [Google''s Willow chip announcement](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/),
            Microsoft announced in November that it had reached a [24-qubit milestone
            with Atom Computing](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2024/11/19/microsoft-and-atom-computing-offer-a-commercial-quantum-machine-with-the-largest-number-of-entangled-logical-qubits-on-record/)
            using lasers, while Japanese researchers from the Riken Quantum Computer
            Research Center [announced a "general-purpose" optical quantum computer](https://www.riken.jp/pr/news/2024/20241108_2/index.html).


            The future implications could be dire. The Hudson Institute, a free-market
            think tank, warns that quantum computers pose a systemic cyber-risk to
            financial systems; it published two papers describing risks of disruption
            to [the US financial system](https://www.hudson.org/technology/prosperity-risk-quantum-computer-threat-us-financial-system)
            and [cryptocurrencies](https://www.hudson.org/technology/decrypting-crypto-cryptocurrencies-and-the-quantum-computer-threat).


            ## Less Than a Decade Away?


            Quantum computing is one of those technologies that many have perennially
            predicted is [only a decade away](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-close-are-we-really-to-building-a-quantum-computer/).
            Currently, the median estimate among experts is that within 15 years,
            a quantum computer will be able to break RSA-2048 in 24 hours, [according
            to the "Quantum Threat Timeline Report 2024."](https://globalriskinstitute.org/publication/2024-quantum-threat-timeline-report/)


            ![GRI quantum computing survey](https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt6d90778a997de1cd/blt49124c40c73091c7/67698437271e5168dd9310fe/GRI-quantum-computing-survey.jpg?width=700&auto=webp&quality=80&disable=upscale)


            The middle-of-the-road estimate of when quantum computers will pose an
            encryption threat is less than 15 years. Source: Global Risk Institute


            While many experts see the possibility of a useful quantum computer in
            less than a decade — based on three key areas: hardware progression, error
            correction, and algorithm development — useful quantum computers still
            have a long way to go before they become possible. For example, while
            Google''s work on Willow is a major step toward making error correction
            — mainly a theoretical field before this decade — more achievable in larger
            quantum computing chips, achieving this step is just the second milestone
            out of six listed on its quantum computer road map.


            Related: [Quantum Leap: Advanced Computing Is a Vulnerable Cyber Target](https://www.darkreading.com/cyber-risk/quantum-leap-advanced-computing-vulnerable-cyber-target)


            In addition, gauging the risk is difficult, with terms such as "threshold
            scalability" and "quantum supercomputers" muddying the waters, says Rebecca
            Krauthamer, co-founder and CEO of QuSecure.


            "There''s so much complicated vocabulary when it comes to quantum, the
            thing that people need to look out for is when they start seeing quantum
            computers beginning to solve problems that they recognize," Krauthamer
            says. "So whether it''s improved battery technology, or route optimization
            for self-driving cars, or optimized portfolio management, or breaking
            encryption — that''s the time everybody should have already migrated to
            post-quantum technologies, and not just post-quantum but crypto-agile
            management of cryptography."


            Yet the lack of significant benefits for the private sector could put
            a damper on development. The Boston Consulting Group, for example, points
            out that quantum computing programs have had difficulty converting effort
            into value.


            "Quantum computing today provides no tangible advantage over classical
            computing in either commercial or scientific applications," BCG [stated
            in a July analysis](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/long-term-forecast-for-quantum-computing-still-looks-bright).
            "Though experts agree that there are clear scientific and commercial problems
            for which quantum solutions will one day far surpass the classical alternative,
            the newer technology has yet to demonstrate this advantage at scale."


            ## Experts Still Urge Preparation


            In addition, the point at which nation-states could use quantum computers
            to break encryption could be sooner, increasing the risk for some industries.
            Quantinuum, for example, accelerated its road map for fully fault-tolerant
            quantum computing to 2030 and warns that quantum secure solutions will
            likely be necessary before 2035.


            "Given where we stand today, the need to complete migration to PQC \[post-quantum
            computing\] to effectively protect sensitive data needs to be prioritized,"
            says Duncan Jones, head of cybersecurity for Quantinuum.


            Quantinuum expects incremental advances in the next few years. That includes
            improvements in error correction and qubit scaling, continued research
            into applications such as quantum decryption, and, as a result, greater
            adoption of PQC technologies, such as post-quantum encryption, quantum
            key distribution, and quantum random number generation (QRNG), says the
            company''s Jones.


            "Organizations implementing quantum-safe strategies today should focus
            on PQC migration while ensuring their cryptographic foundations are as
            strong as possible through the use of QRNGs," he says. "This approach
            provides immediate security benefits while preparing for future quantum-safe
            technologies."


            Google acknowledges that while its error correction breakthrough is significant,
            there is a difference between theory and practice.


            "We still have a long way to go before we reach our goal of building a
            large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer," two members of the Google
            Quantum AI team [stated in a blog post](https://research.google/blog/making-quantum-error-correction-work/).
            "The engineering challenge ahead of us is immense."

            Key Points


            - Google’s new quantum chip, Willow, drastically reduces computation times.

            - Its speed and accuracy could theoretically provide hackers with the
            tools to unlock the algorithms that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies
            are built upon.

            - But Google says it is still 10 years away from quantum that can decode
            crypto, and new quantum-safe cryptocurrencies may emerge.

            Google Quantum AI’s “Willow” chip in an undated handout photo obtained
            by Reuters on Dec. 6, 2024.


            Google \| Via Reuters


            Google’s recent announcement of [the arrival of Willow](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/10/alphabet-shares-jump-5percent-after-google-touts-breakthrough-quantum-chip-.html),
            a quantum chip that has reduced [the error tendencies](https://www.cnbc.com/video/2024/12/10/problem-with-quantum-computing-is-error-correction-says-gene-munster-on-googles-new-chip.html)
            of some of its predecessors, is a milestone in the effort to bring quantum
            computing into the real world, and in the years ahead, it could change
            the way we think about the risk in cryptocurrencies.


            Willow’s speed is almost incomprehensible — [according to Google](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/),
            it’s able to perform a computation in under five minutes that would take
            one of today’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years to solve. Ten
            septillion is 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years.


            But the accuracy of quantum computing has, until now, also been a big
            issue, with quantum like a garden hose on full blast with no one holding
            it: the water is coming out fast, but its aim is not consistently accurate.
            Willow’s combination of speed and accuracy could theoretically provide
            hackers with the tools to unlock the algorithms that bitcoin and other
            cryptocurrencies are built upon.


            ### Qubits and bitcoin can coexist, for now


            If you don’t understand (not many people do) what makes up quantum computing
            — qubits — security company DigiCert’s industry technology strategist,
            Tim Hollebeek, has a simplified way of thinking about the breakthrough.
            He says imagine a maze and how a classical computer would try to find
            its way through the maze from start to finish. It would try one potential
            path at a time. “A quantum computer would be able to try each path at
            the same time, resulting in a much faster solution,” Hollebeek said.


            While Willow [may not be ready for real-world applications](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/12/10/google-claims-quantum-milestone-but-cant-solve-real-world-problems-.html)
            yet, Willow’s speed and accuracy will help pave the way for larger-scale
            quantum computers.


            “Part of the issue with qubits is that they are unstable and produce errors.
            This chip has significant error correction capabilities, which mitigates
            some of the qubit issues,”  Hollebeek said.


            That means chips improving upon Willow’s breakthrough will be able to
            help hackers target crypto — but at least for the moment, the concern
            is only theoretical.


            “Quantum computers can theoretically solve this much faster and pose a
            threat to today’s cryptographic algorithms if a quantum computer with
            sufficient qubits could be developed,” Hollebeek said. But he added that
            the real-world reason for breathing easier today if you own crypto is
            simple. “None exist today and are not expected for at least another 5,
            10, 15 years,” he said, with the fastest five-year timeline contingent
            on some unforeseen technological breakthrough.


            ### A decade-long lead for crypto


            A Google spokesman told CNBC that Willow and crypto can coexist. “The
            Willow chip is incapable of breaking modern cryptography,” he said, adding
            that it is also the view of Google that quantum technology with that capability
            is still years off.


            In fact, according to Park Feierbach, an expert in decentralized finance
            technology who is CEO of Radiant Commons, even if Willow can drastically
            increase the speed at which crypto could be broken, it would still take
            several times the age of the universe for the quantum chip to do it. According
            to NASA, the universe is 13.7 billion years old.


            “There’s almost no reason to deploy Willow on this technology in a way
            that could make tractable progress. It would simply still take too long,”
            Feierbach said.


            “Estimates are we’re at least 10 years out from breaking RSA, and that
            around 4 million physical qubits would be required to do this,” the Google
            spokesman said. RSA is an encryption system used in cryptocurrencies.


            For reference, Google’s processors are now on the scale of about 100 physical
            qubits.


            ### ‘Quantum-safe’ algorithms


            The Google spokesman stressed that the timeline for quantum breakthroughs
            has been widely shared and Willow has not changed it.


            “Google is on track with our planned roadmap,” he said. “The security
            community has long been aware of the projected timeline to break asymmetric
            encryption, and has been working on defining standards and collaboratively
            implementing new algorithms that will resist attacks by both classical
            and quantum computers,” the spokesman added.


            Indeed, Hollebeek says that the crypto industry is working on “quantum-safe”
            crypto.


            The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has released
            several quantum-safe algorithms that are resistant to attacks by future
            quantum computers, Hollebeek said, and NIST has a timeline for governments
            and industry to deploy these algorithms to ensure the safety of the nation’s
            and businesses secrets.


            “Google and other industry leaders have supported standardization and
            experimented with the algorithms in their draft form,” the Google spokesman
            said.


            Despite how efficient quantum is at unlocking algorithms (traditional
            crypto equations based on factoring huge prime numbers), it isn’t infallible,
            and that is where the promise lies in quantum-safe crypto.


            “They’re really, really good at some things, but not everything,” Hollebeek
            said, noting that breaking conventional asymmetric cryptography just happens
            to be one of the things they are really good at. “Luckily, there are other
            hard math problems they are bad at, and asymmetric cryptography can be
            updated to use those hard math problems instead of factoring,” he said.


            Taqi Raza **,** assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering
            at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, said existing cryptos will
            have to evolve to ward off qubits. “As the potential for quantum computers
            to break existing cryptography becomes more of a concern, new cryptocurrencies
            specifically designed to be quantum-safe could be developed. These new
            quantum cryptos would integrate PQC, cryptographic algorithms that are
            resistant to the computational power of quantum computers,” Raza said.


            Jeremy Allaire, co-founder, chairman & CEO of digital currency company
            Circle, told CNBC in an interview last week that the risk is real, but
            his view of the future remains focused on the opportunities that will
            evolve. “The bottom line is quantum crypto means that you can both unlock
            things more easily, things that had bad old locks, but you can also create
            better locks,” Allaire said. “So quantum crypto – this quantum is going
            to be actually a huge turbocharge to crypto computing, to crypto applications,
            and to crypto money.”


            Raza thinks that ultimately the more sweeping changes wrought by quantum
            computing will occur beyond crypto. Breakthroughs will make devices and
            software faster, revolutionize AI, and improve data security with ultra-secure
            encryption methods. In everyday life, there will be advances in computing,
            healthcare, energy, and security, Raza said, and as a result, it is not
            the crypto industry we should be thinking about in isolation while these
            changes are still developing. “They will likely transform industries,”
            he said.

            ## The quantum computing industry still hasn’t settled on a hardware standard
            and we’re still years away from commercial use. But in 2024, all the major
            vendors made significant progress in improving capabilites and reducing
            error rates, and investment hit an all-time high.

            There was a time, back in the early days of computing, when we had vacuum
            tubes, relays, mechanical gears plus several different types of analog
            computers. We’re kind of in that same era today with quantum computers.
            We have analog quantum computers that can be used to solve very specific
            problems, and several different approaches to general purpose quantum
            computers, including those with semiconducting qubits, trapped ions, spin
            qubits, quantum dots, topological qubits, photonic qubits, neutral atom
            qubits — and many more. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses and
            use cases.


            The options furthest along when it comes to actual real-world use cases
            are the analog quantum computers like those that use quantum annealing
            technology. This is useful for solving some quantum-related physics and
            optimization problems in a way similar to how a bathtub full of water
            can solve the problem of calculating the volume of an oddly-shaped physical
            object — such as, say, a crown. Eureka?


            When it comes to the general-purpose quantum computers, the superconducting
            approach seems to be in the lead right now, according to Gartner analyst
            Chirag Dekate. “The physics is much better understood and it’s now an
            engineering problem, not a physics problem,” he says.


            Despite the fact that we seem to be years away from having practical working
            quantum computers, or even a common set of standards for how to build
            these things, investors, governments, and large corporations are taking
            quantum computing seriously.


            For example, this summer, the National Institute of Standards and Technology
            [released a set of quantum-proof encryption algorithms](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3486075/nist-finally-settles-on-quantum-safe-crypto-standards.html),
            so that the world has time to get ready for when quantum computers do
            arrive.


            NIST isn’t alone in seeing massive disruptive potential in quantum computing.
            So do investors.


            As of mid-November, Crunchbase reports that [quantum computing funding](https://news.crunchbase.com/venture/quantum-computing-funding-record-high-ai-quantinuum/)
            has hit a record high — $1.5 billion so far in 2024. That’s nearly twice
            the total of 2023 and significantly higher than the previous record, set
            in 2022, of $963 million.


            And some large, cutting-edge enterprises are already beginning to spend
            money on quantum technology. [Hyperion Research](https://hyperionresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Hyperion-Research-HPC-and-AI-Market-Update-SC24-1.pdf)
            estimates that the global quantum computing market has reached the $1
            billion mark this year and is expected to grow to $1.5 billion in 2026
            — though the top use case for the next couple of years will remain research
            and development in quantum computing.


            According to a September [report](https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/tech-forward/enabling-the-next-frontier-of-quantum-computing)
            from McKinsey, 55% percent of quantum industry leaders said they had a
            quantum use case in production this year, up from 33% last year. This
            means that they have developed an application that shows an advantage
            over a classical approach though not necessarily one that is fully rolled
            out and commercially viable at scale.


            “We’re really at the level of real-world use cases,” says Holger Mueller,
            an analyst at Constellation Research. “We’ve jumped the qubit barrier.”


            ## 1\. QuEra demonstrates new error correction method


            This year started off with a series of announcements about breakthroughs
            in error correction. What’s the deal with error correction? Qubits are
            ridiculously sensitive and unreliable.


            “Error correction is vital for enterprise users of quantum computing,”
            says Yoram Avidan, CTO of Citigroup’s Innovation Lab and global head of
            Citi Accelerator.


            Error correction ensures the accuracy and reliability of quantum computations,
            he says, which is particularly important for financial monitoring. “Error
            correction capabilities are crucial for enabling stable, predictable,
            and accurate quantum-based solutions, especially in the context of financial
            applications we are running in the bank,” Avidan says. “Error correction
            will definitely accelerate the adoption of quantum-based solutions in
            the bank.”


            But while Citigroup waits for that to happen, it’s already experimenting
            with the technology that’s available. Citi is using Amazon Braket, a cloud-based
            service, to see how well quantum computers could handle portfolio optimization
            tasks. Amazon Braket supports a number of physical quantum computers,
            including computers from IonQ, Rigetti, Oxford Quantum Circuits, and QuEra.


            To solve the error problem, quantum computing companies use multiple physical
            qubits to create one error-corrected qubits. And by “multiple,” that can
            mean “thousands.”


            Which brings us to the first major error correction news of the year:
            QuEra’s January announcement that it achieved a logical qubit using only
            eight physical qubits, [demonstrating a new error correction method](https://www.networkworld.com/article/1308630/error-correction-breakthroughs-brings-quantum-computing-a-step-closer.html)
            using transversal gates.


            The company outlined a three-year roadmap that calls for a computer with
            10 logical qubits in 2024, 30 in 2025 using “magic state distillation,”
            and 100 logical qubits by 2026. Their system is already available on Amazon
            Braket.


            The trade-off is speed. QuEra’s system runs slower than alternatives but
            prioritizes error correction quality. On-premises systems can be ordered
            for 2025 delivery.


            ## 2\. Alice & Bob devise cat qubits


            Also in January, quantum computing startup Alice & Bob announced their
            [new quantum error correction architecture](https://www.networkworld.com/article/1308630/error-correction-breakthroughs-brings-quantum-computing-a-step-closer.html).


            Alice & Bob’s biggest breakthrough in error correction comes from cat
            qubits — named after Schroedinger’s Cat — which reduce the number of dimensions
            that noise comes from. And, on top of that, the company also gets some
            error correction by bounding photos around an electronic circuit, says
            CEO Théau Peronnin


            ## 3\. Nord Quantique claims industry-first quantum error correction at
            qubit level


            In February, Nord Quantique [announced a 14% improvement in qubit reliability](https://www.networkworld.com/article/1308630/error-correction-breakthroughs-brings-quantum-computing-a-step-closer.html)
            using a similar error correction technique, one that bounces photons in
            an aluminum container the size of a walnut. And this approach doesn’t
            suffer from QuEra’s speed problem.


            Nord Quantique links the photons to physical qubits, providing redundancy
            without the massive overhead of traditional error correction. The company
            plans to deliver a 100-logical-qubit system by 2028.


            Their approach works particularly well with superconducting circuits and
            operates at megahertz frequency, 100 to 1,000 times faster than competing
            systems, the company says.


            ## 4\. IBM launches Qiskit functions catalog


            After a bit of slowdown in the summer, quantum computing news announcements
            picked up again in the fall. First came a breakthrough on the ecosystem
            side.


            IBM launched its [Qiskit Functions catalog](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3523669/ibm-microsoft-and-boeing-mark-advances-in-quantum-computing.html),
            offering six quantum services designed to make it easier for enterprise
            developers to work with quantum algorithms. The catalog includes functions
            from IBM and partners like Algorithmiq and Q-CTRL that improve error correction
            and simplify quantum circuit development. Two functions remove the need
            to understand quantum circuits, focusing on optimization and chemistry
            applications.


            The system is part of IBM’s vision for quantum-centric supercomputing,
            combining quantum and classical resources. Early users include Cleveland
            Clinic for molecular simulations and RIKEN for materials research.


            ## 5\. Microsoft and Quantinuum announce 12 logical qubits


            Also in September, Microsoft announced that it [partnered with Quantinuum](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3523669/ibm-microsoft-and-boeing-mark-advances-in-quantum-computing.html)
            to create 12 logical qubits, which, according to Krysta Svore, Microsoft’s
            vice president of advanced quantum development, was, at the time, the
            most logical qubits on record. Quantinuum provided the quantum hardware
            and Microsoft handled the error correction.


            These quantum computers are still too small to do anything that classical
            computers can’t do, but they can already allow companies to experiment
            with use cases and test algorithms. “We have entered the era of reliable
            quantum computation,” Svore says.


            ## 6\. Microsoft and Atom Computing’s announce 24 working logical qubits


            Then, since 12 logical qubits weren’t enough, in November Microsoft followed
            up with a [joint announcement](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2024/11/19/microsoft-and-atom-computing-offer-a-commercial-quantum-machine-with-the-largest-number-of-entangled-logical-qubits-on-record/)
            with a different quantum hardware company, Atom Computing. This time,
            the two companies hit a massive milestone by creating 24 working logical
            qubits, the most ever demonstrated, on a base of 112 physical qubits.


            Atom Computing uses the “neutral atoms” approach to quantum computing,
            and in this approach, the neutral atom qubits, in addition to developing
            errors, can also become completely lost. This announcement is the first
            demonstration on record of loss correction in a commercial neutral-atom
            system.


            The team used a clever combination of hardware and software, trapping
            the atoms in a grid using lasers, then applied Microsoft’s error-correction
            software. As a result, they cut error rates by more than four times compared
            to regular physical qubits.


            “Microsoft, with Atom, has a scalable way of achieving logical qubits,”
            says Gartner’s Dekate. “There is real progress happening. The quantum
            industry is building better, larger, more scalable computers. The pace
            of innovation continues to accelerate.”


            Enterprise customers can order the system now through Microsoft Azure,
            with delivery in 2025. It works with regular cloud computing and AI tools,
            so businesses can start integrating quantum capabilities into their existing
            operations.


            According to Microsoft’s Svore, the total number of usable, logical qubits
            will go up to 50, and the bigger number of qubits allow customers to start
            integrating reliable logical quantum computing into their workflows for
            applications such as chemistry and materials science.


            “First deployments are expected to be a hybrid solution of an on-premises
            machine and cloud, to enable easy access to cloud offerings like Azure
            HPC and Azure Elements,” she says. “Full cloud deployment is also possible
            per customer request.”


            ## 7\. IBM doubles capability, increases speed 50-fold


            Not to be outdone, IBM announced in November that it, too, has [doubled
            its quantum computing capacity](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3607725/ibm-announces-50-fold-quantum-speed-improvement.html)
            — its new 156-qubit Heron quantum processor can run circuits with up to
            5,000 two-qubit gate operations. Plus, there was a dramatic speedup in
            performance — the system completed a task in 2.2 hours that previously
            took 112 hours.


            Using Qiskit software, IBM’s system enables researchers to explore quantum
            applications in chemistry, materials science, and other fields, the company
            said. The Cleveland Clinic is already using it to simulate molecular bonds
            for drug discovery.


            The improvements come from both hardware and software advances. IBM’s
            platform now integrates quantum and classical computing resources, allowing
            customers to choose the best tools for each part of their calculations.


            With progress in both error correction and on the software side, IBM is
            the company to watch, says Constellation Research’s Mueller. “It puts
            the whole market into overdrive,” he says.


            ## 8\. RIKEN and NTT launch world first general-purpose optical quantum
            computer


            RIKEN and NTT [launched the world’s first general-purpose optical quantum
            computer](https://www.riken.jp/pr/news/2024/20241108_2/index.html) in
            November. The system operates at nearly room temperature and processes
            at speeds up to several hundred terahertz.


            The computer uses continuous-variable analog design with time-division
            multiplexing, where computations occur through quantum teleportation.
            It can handle approximately 100 continuous quantity inputs. The system
            is accessible through a cloud service and is designed for materials science,
            chemistry, and AI applications.


            One major benefit of this approach to quantum computing is that it operates
            at room temperature. By comparison, superconducting qubits and trapped
            ion cubits operate at temperatures close to absolute zero. According to
            Riken, the optical quantum computer is also faster than other quantum
            computing platforms.


            ## 9\. D-Wave speeds up processing 25,000 times


            And in yet another kind of quantum computing — the analog kind — D-Wave
            released the [benchmark results](https://www.dwavesys.com/company/newsroom/press-release/d-wave-achieves-significant-milestone-with-calibration-of-4-400-qubit-advantage2-processor/)
            for its latest 4,400-plus qubit Advantage2 processor in November, with
            big performance gains. The system solves materials science problems 25,000
            times faster than its previous version, the company claims.


            The new processor doubles qubit coherence time and has improved qubit
            connectivity, enabling solutions to larger problems.


            The system delivered five times better solutions for high-precision applications
            and outperformed the previous version in 99% of satisfiability problem
            tests, the company said. It’s available now through D-Wave’s quantum cloud
            service.


            D-Wave’s qubits can’t be directly compared to those of other companies,
            however, because it’s not a general-purpose computer but a narrow-purpose
            analog one.


            ## 10\. Google uses AI to improve error correction


            We can expect to see even more progress on error correction next year.
            One reason? Artificial intelligence.


            In late November, Google announced an AI system that [spots errors in
            quantum computers](https://blog.google/technology/google-deepmind/alphaqubit-quantum-error-correction/).
            This uses the same transformer technology that’s behind large language
            models and other types of generative AI, but trained specifically on quantum
            processes.


            The system is too slow to be actually used in real-time to spot errors,
            Google says, but, as AI technology improves, it could point to an additional
            way to reduce error rates.


            ## The road ahead


            So, when will we have working quantum computers?


            Analysts at the Boston Consulting Group say they’ve been disappointed
            in the lack of recent progress of actual enterprise use cases.


            “Quantum computing today provides no tangible advantage over classical
            computing in either commercial or scientific applications,” Boston Consulting
            Group researchers wrote in a July [report](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2024/long-term-forecast-for-quantum-computing-still-looks-bright).
            “Though experts agree that there are clear scientific and commercial problems
            for which quantum solutions will one day far surpass the classical alternative,
            the newer technology has yet to demonstrate this advantage at scale.”


            According to the firm, our current era, that of “noisy intermediate-scale
            quantum” will last until 2030.


            At this stage, quantum computers have too few qubits and too many errors
            to be practically useful, but they can be used to test algorithms and
            do other preliminary research.


            Broad quantum advantage — where quantum computers can be used to solve
            problems that traditional computers can’t handle — will last from approximately
            2030 to 2040, according to the Boston Computing Group. At that time, the
            research firm predicts that end users will see between $80 and $170 billion
            in total annual value creations.


            In 2040, according to the research firm, we’ll enter the era of full-scale
            fault tolerance, and end users will see between $450 and $850 billion
            of value creation per year. This is when errors are reduced to the point
            that quantum computers can be scaled up to handle pretty much anything
            thrown at them.


            Some quantum computing companies expect to get there even faster. For
            example, IBM’s [quantum roadmap](https://www.ibm.com/roadmaps/quantum.pdf)
            has the company delivering a fully error-corrected system in 2029. It
            expects to have a quantum computer with over 2,000 error-corrected qubits
            — or logical qubits — after 2033.


            It takes many physical qubits to create one error-corrected logical qubit,
            so IBM expects to have a 100,000-qubit computer by then, capable of running
            1 billion gates.


            IBM is the company to watch, says Gartner’s Dekate. “It’s very clear that
            IBM is leading,” he says. “They’re innovating at every layer of the stack.
            But it is early days.” Achieving workable quantum computers is a marathon,
            he says. “And we’re in the first five minutes.”


            Whoever is ahead today might not necessarily win the race, he says. “Enterprises
            should not fall into the trap of trying to figure out who’s ahead and
            who’s behind — that will lead enterprises to make bad decisions, because
            the leaderboard will change quite dramatically.”


            He suggests that companies looking to take the lead in finding ways to
            take advantage of quantum computing should partner with multiple vendors
            and explore different pathways. And, instead of focusing on finding short-term
            investment returns, they should instead think about skills development,
            building capabilities, investigating use cases, and preparing for disruptions.

        - title: Professor Achieves Major Quantum Computing Breakthrough

            Quantum computers have to be kept cold to function — very cold. These
            machines generally run at “just a few degrees above absolute zero,” says
            [Yoseob Yoon](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/yoon-yoseob/), assistant
            professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at Northeastern University.
            “It’s colder than outer space.”


            Yoon’s research focuses on “controlling material properties using lasers,”
            he says.


            In other words, he shoots light at atomically thin materials to get them
            moving in novel ways.


            One of his principal materials is something called graphene, a two-dimensional
            surface whose discoverers received the [Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2010/summary/),
            Yoon says.


            ![Headshot of Yoseob Yoon. ](https://news.northeastern.edu/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/070224_MM_Yoseob_Yoon_027.jpg)Yoseob

            Yoon produces graphene through what he calls the Scotch Tape method. “We
            use a few millimeter-wide and -thick bulk materials of, for example, graphite,”
            he says, the same carbon derivative found in pencils. “We basically use
            Scotch Tape — literally — to peel off” ultra-thin samples from the bulk
            material.


            These samples are the thickness of a single atom, “smoother than most
            other materials,” he says.


            There already existed a field studying “thermal transport using thin metallic
            films,” Yoon says. By firing lasers at very thin metals, researchers can
            induce controlled oscillations like acoustic waves in drums.


            However, “this has been limited to gigahertz regimes, because these metals
            are very heavy, and they cannot be controlled down to monolayer thickness.


            “And then there is another field, basically a 2D-material field,” he continues.
            “They exfoliate these atomically thin layers.”


            Yoon’s breakthrough came in combining these two fields. By aligning atomically
            thin structures with the study of laser-based thermal transport, “there’s
            a new regime that we couldn’t achieve before.”

            Now, in [a new paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07604-9) published
            in Nature, Yoon and his collaborators have identified novel van der Waals
            heterostructures (created by combining layers of these atomically thin
            materials, including graphene and other varieties) that allow control
            at terahertz frequencies.


            Here’s what that means. Yoon notes that “temperature” is really just atoms
            in motion. The faster the atoms move, the higher the temperature. In a
            quantum computer, this motion translates to random noise, inhibiting the
            computer’s function. Cooling a quantum computer, therefore, increases
            controllability.


            Current transducers in quantum computers are limited to the gigahertz
            range. “That limits the range of temperatures that can be operated,” Yoon
            says. “They can operate only at low temperatures.” Colder than outer space,
            remember.


            “Because of this frequency limit,” he continues, increasing the range
            of these transducers into terahertz frequencies — an increase by a factor
            of a thousand — “we will be able to run \[quantum computers\] at room
            temperatures.”


            In other words, a machine that runs close to negative 460 degrees Fahrenheit
            can suddenly be run at room temperature.


            At least this particular component, Yoon is quick to point out. “There
            are some disadvantages of going to higher temperatures, \[for instance,\]
            quantum signals will decay much faster.”


            So this isn’t the ultimate solution in room temperature quantum computing,
            but it is one major step toward that goal. Additionally, this “discovery
            also allows for the design of more efficient heat management components
            in classical computers,” he wrote in a follow-up.


            What comes next? “We’ve pushed in terms of frequency bandwidth, and how
            high the frequency can be,” he says. “But we didn’t push to the amplitude
            limits.”


            “We want to push the limit.”

          text: 'The annual prize for the Physics Breakthrough of the Year has been
            awarded today to scientists working at the cutting-edge of quantum computing. 
            After drawing up a shortlist of 10 landmark discoveries for the year,
            the editorial team at Physics World has put two teams working on quantum
            computing in joint first place. The first award goes to Mikhail Lukin
            and Dolev Bluvstein, along with colleagues at Harvard University, the
            Massachusetts Institute of Technology and QuEra Computing. And a second,
            independently, has been given to Hartmut Neven and colleagues at Google
            Quantum AI. Both teams have been working on quantum error correction,
            a crucial step in demonstrating that the technology can be made to work
            in real-world settings. Correcting errors caused by interactions with
            the environment has been described as the ‘defining challenge’ for quantum.
            The two teams, working with very different quantum systems, have both
            taken significant steps towards overcoming this challenge. Following the
            announcement, Physics World editor-in-chief Matin Durrani said: “An important
            feature of the award is that the two winners have done very complementary
            experimental work in quantum error correction. “I want to congratulate
            everyone involved, which moves us all closer to a day when quantum computers
            will become practical problem-solving machines, not just noisy, intermediate-scale
            tools for scientific research. “The Harvard team has shown that a large
            number of logical qubits (48) can be integrated in a processor that can
            do logical operations – previously only a handful of logical qubits have
            been integrated. “The Google team has shown that increasing the number
            of physical qubits in a logical qubit can lead to an exponential decrease
            in the error rate. “These may feel like quite technical advances, but
            they are incredibly significant and worthy, joint winners, of our Breakthrough
            of the Year.” The two quantum winners are part of the Physics World Top
            10 Breakthroughs of the Year for 2024, announced last week, which included
            research in nuclear and medical physics, quantum computing, lasers, antimatter
            and more. The full list of the top 10 can be viewed on the Physics World
            website.'

        answer: 'Quantum supremacy, or quantum advantage, refers to the point at which
          a programmable quantum computer can solve a problem that no classical computer
          can ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy),
          [quera.com](https://www.quera.com/glossary/quantum-supremacy)). It demonstrates
          the ability of quantum computers to solve specific calculations faster than
          classical computers ([techtarget.com](https://www.techtarget.com/searchsecurity/definition/quantum-supremacy)).
          This concept highlights the unique resources of quantum computers, such
