          \nFULL STORY\n\n* * *\n\nThe full power of next-generation quantum computing\
          \ could soon be harnessed by millions of individuals and companies, thanks\
          \ to a breakthrough by scientists at Oxford University Physics guaranteeing\
          \ security and privacy. This advance promises to unlock the transformative\
          \ potential of cloud-based quantum computing and is detailed in a new study\
          \ published in the influential U.S. scientific journal _Physical Review\
          \ Letters_.\n\nQuantum computing is developing rapidly, paving the way for\
          \ new applications which could transform services in many areas like healthcare\
          \ and financial services. It works in a fundamentally different way to conventional\
          \ computing and is potentially far more powerful. However, it currently\
          \ requires controlled conditions to remain stable and there are concerns\
          \ around data authenticity and the effectiveness of current security and\
          \ encryption systems.\n\nSeveral leading providers of cloud-based services,\
          \ like Google, Amazon, and IBM, already separately offer some elements of\
          \ quantum computing. Safeguarding the privacy and security of customer data\
          \ is a vital precursor to scaling up and expending its use, and for the\
          \ development of new applications as the technology advances. The new study\
          \ by researchers at Oxford University Physics addresses these challenges.\n\
          \n\"We have shown for the first time that quantum computing in the cloud\
          \ can be accessed in a scalable, practical way which will also give people\
          \ complete security and privacy of data, plus the ability to verify its\
          \ authenticity,\" said Professor David Lucas, who co-heads the Oxford University\
          \ Physics research team and is lead scientist at the UK Quantum Computing\
          \ and Simulation Hub, led from Oxford University Physics.\n\nIn the new\
          \ study, the researchers use an approach dubbed \"blind quantum computing,\"\
          \ which connects two totally separate quantum computing entities -- potentially\
          \ an individual at home or in an office accessing a cloud server -- in a\
          \ completely secure way. Importantly, their new methods could be scaled\
          \ up to large quantum computations.\n\n\"Using blind quantum computing,\
          \ clients can access remote quantum computers to process confidential data\
          \ with secret algorithms and even verify the results are correct, without\
          \ revealing any useful information. Realising this concept is a big step\
          \ forward in both quantum computing and keeping our information safe online''\
          \ said study lead Dr Peter Drmota, of Oxford University Physics.\n\nThe\
          \ researchers created a system comprising a fibre network link between a\
          \ quantum computing server and a simple device detecting photons, or particles\
          \ of light, at an independent computer remotely accessing its cloud services.\
          \ This allows so-called blind quantum computing over a network. Every computation\
          \ incurs a correction which must be applied to all that follow and needs\
          \ real-time information to comply with the algorithm. The researchers used\
          \ a unique combination of quantum memory and photons to achieve this.\n\n\
          \"Never in history have the issues surrounding privacy of data and code\
          \ been more urgently debated than in the present era of cloud computing\
          \ and artificial intelligence,\" said Professor David Lucas. \"As quantum\
          \ computers become more capable, people will seek to use them with complete\
          \ security and privacy over networks, and our new results mark a step change\
          \ in capability in this respect.\"\n\nThe results could ultimately lead\
          \ to commercial development of devices to plug into laptops, to safeguard\
          \ data when people are using quantum cloud computing services.\n\nResearchers\
          \ exploring quantum computing and technologies at Oxford University Physics\
          \ have access to the state-of-the-art Beecroft laboratory facility, specially\
          \ constructed to create stable and secure conditions including eliminating\
          \ vibration.\n\nFunding for the research came from the UK Quantum Computing\
          \ and Simulation (QCS) Hub, with scientists from the UK National Quantum\
          \ Computing Centre, the Paris-Sorbonne University, the University of Edinburgh,\
          \ and the University of Maryland, collaborating on the work.\n\n- [RELATED\

          # Physicists take step toward fault-tolerant quantum computing


          by Kate Blackwood, [Cornell University](http://www.cornell.edu/)

          Some classical computers have error correction built into their memories
          based on bits; quantum computers, to be workable in the future, will need
          error correction mechanisms, too, based on the vastly more sensitive qubits.


          Cornell researchers have recently taken a step toward fault-tolerant quantum
          computing: they constructed a simple model containing exotic particles called
          non-Abelian anyons, compact and practical enough to run on modern quantum
          hardware. Realizing these particles, which can only exist in two dimensions,
          is a move towards implementing it in the real world.


          Thanks to some creative thinking, Yuri Lensky, a former Bethe/Wilkins/Kavli
          Institute at Cornell (KIC) postdoctoral fellow in physics in the College
          of Arts and Sciences (A&S), collaborating with Eun-Ah Kim, professor of
          physics (A&S), came up with a simple "recipe" that could be used for robustly
          computing with non-Abelian anyons, including specific instructions for executing
          the effect experimentally on devices available today.


          Their paper, "Graph Gauge Theory of Mobile Non-Abelian Anyons in a Qubit
          Stabilizer Code," written in collaboration with theorists at Google Quantum
          AI, published March 24 in _Annals of Physics_. Google Quantum AI researchers,
          together with Lensky and Kim, have proved the theory with a successful experiment
          as reported in a preprint publication, "Observation of Non-Abelian Exchange
          Statistics on a Superconducting Processor," on the research-sharing platform
          _arXiv_.


          "This two-dimensional state is interesting both from a quantum condensed
          matter physics perspective—it has some novel properties that are very special
          to 2D physics—and from a quantum information perspective," Lensky said.
          "It''s something truly quantum, but it''s also potentially useful for quantum
          computation. It protects bits of quantum information by storing them non-locally,
          and our protocol allows us to compute with these bits."


          Kim explained the principle that animates non-Abelian anyons by holding
          out two identical one-pound barbells. When she crosses her arms, the identical
          barbells change positions, but as objects defined by classical physics,
          their state remains the same. They are interchangeable.


          If those barbells represent two identical quantum particles, remarkably
          in certain 2D systems their trails through [space-time](https://phys.org/tags/space-time/)
          can produce a measurable record of the change (picture the crossed arms.)
          This process of exchange is called a braid, after the shapes of the particle
          trails.


          "Quantum mechanically, when you move one particle around the other," Kim
          said, holding one weight still and moving the other in a circle around it,
          "the [wave function](https://phys.org/tags/wave+function/), which is a solution
          to the Schrödinger equation describing quantum mechanical motion, can be
          multiplied by a phase factor or it can become something that''s very different."


          When the wave function gains a global sign that can only be observed through
          interferometry, a measurement of the interference of waves, that''s called
          an Abelian anyon. When the wave function becomes measurably different, it''s
          a non-Abelian [anyon](https://phys.org/tags/anyon/), she said.


          Non-Abelian anyons could be harnessed to create qubits defined not on a
          single particle, but on a pair of identical quantum particles: nonlocally
          encoded.


          "If I put the qubit shared between these particles in a zero state and move
          them apart, then whatever happens locally to one of these anyons, the zero
          state will remain. The qubit set to zero is safe from corruption," Kim said.
          "Non-Abelian anyons could be used in a platform for protected qubits."


          But while physicists have theorized about these [exotic particles](https://phys.org/tags/exotic+particles/)
          for years—Alexei Kitaev proposed operating on protected bits of quantum
          memory by braiding non-Abelian anyons back around 2001, Lensky said—they
          have never been observed in a physical system before now.


          When Google Quantum AI developed the quantum processor platform capabilities
          to realize the surface code and braiding of Abelian anyons in a physical
          system, Lensky said, "This was \[our\] inspiration to look for a way to
          realize the physics of non-Abelian anyons as soon as possible."


          "We knew they had the working ingredients, but they didn''t have a recipe,"
          Kim said. "We figured out how to move these non-Abelian anyons, then we
          told the experimentalists what to do. It was possible because Yuri and I
          were thinking in a flexible, creative and open-minded way."


          Past [theoretical research](https://phys.org/tags/theoretical+research/)
          identified non-Abelian properties, but came up short on how to move them,
          a necessary step. A key insight from Lensky and Kim was to give up the regularity
          of a grid and arrange qubits in an almost hand-drawn manner but backed up
          by robust mathematics.


          "After this simple geometric insight, using gauge theory, we were able to
          come up with the protocol of taking this picture and implementing it on
          a chip in a robust and efficient way," Kim said. "With this 10-qubit system,
          we were able to encode multiple non-Abelian anyons, and therefore multiple
          logical information-carrying qubits, and a precise recipe for what the experimentalists
          need to do every step of the way."


          "Although the focus of the theory and experiment is simply to realize non-Abelian
          anyons in the real world, this can also be viewed as a first small step
          towards implementing computation by braiding," Lensky said.

        text: '# Teleportation Achieved Between Quantum Computers in a World First


          [Physics](https://www.sciencealert.com/physics) 12 February 2025


          By [Mike McRae](https://www.sciencealert.com/mike-mcrae)


          ![abstract light connected in a network](https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/TeleportationConceptCover.jpg)(Yuichiro
          Chino/Getty Images)


          In a groundbreaking use of teleportation, critical units of a quantum processor
          have been successfully spread across multiple computers, proving the potential
          of distributing quantum modules without compromising on their performance.


          While the transfer only took place over a space of two meters (about six
          feet) in an Oxford University laboratory, the leap was more than enough
          to emphasize the feasibility of scaling quantum technology by teleporting
          quantum states [across an ''internet'' of connected systems](https://www.sciencealert.com/quantum-teleportation-achieved-over-internet-for-first-time).


          [Teleportation is a quirk of physics](https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-have-teleported-information-between-particles-of-matter-for-the-first-time)
          that only makes sense through a quantum lens, where objects exist in a blur
          of possible characteristics until processes of measurement force them to
          adopt each state.


          By mingling the undecided states of different objects in [an act known as
          entanglement](https://www.sciencealert.com/physicists-just-entangled-a-pair-of-atomic-clocks-six-feet-apart),
          and then carefully choosing the right kinds of measurements to make on one,
          it''s possible to use the answers to force an entangled object some distance
          away to adopt (and destroy) the original object''s quantum identity.


          It might not be the kind of teleportation that would beam passengers through
          the vacuum of space in a blink, but it''s perfect for sharing the blur of
          information necessary for logical operations in a quantum processor.


          " [Previous demonstrations](https://www.sciencealert.com/quantum-gate-operations-teleported-reliably-first-time)
          of quantum teleportation have focused on transferring quantum states between
          physically separated systems," [says](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-02-06-first-distributed-quantum-algorithm-brings-quantum-supercomputers-closer)
          lead author Dougal Main, a physicist at Oxford University.


          "In our study, we use quantum teleportation to create interactions between
          these distant systems."


          ![Dougal Main working on a quantum computer](https://www.sciencealert.com/images/2025/02/teleport_quantum_comps_642.jpg)Dougal
          Main and team member Beth Nichol working on the distributed [quantum computer](https://www.sciencealert.com/quantum-computers).
          ( [John Cairns](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2025-02-06-first-distributed-quantum-algorithm-brings-quantum-supercomputers-closer))


          Where classical computers use binary ''on or off'' switches to perform strings
          of computations on bits of information, [quantum computers](https://www.sciencealert.com/quantum-computers)
          use mathematically complex distributions of possibilities known as qubits,
          typically represented in a simple feature of an uncharged particle such
          as a charged atom.


          [To make this process practical](https://www.sciencealert.com/it-s-official-google-and-nasa-claim-quantum-supremacy-in-controversial-world-first),
          hundreds or even thousands of such particles need to have their yet-to-be-decided
          states entangled with one another in a restricted fashion, without intrusive
          objects weaving their own possibilities in and messing up the calculations.


          Scaling current technology to this level is complicated by obstacles that
          require [error-correcting processes](https://www.sciencealert.com/a-new-quantum-technique-could-change-how-we-study-the-universe)
          or [shielding](https://www.sciencealert.com/natural-radiation-could-be-a-problem-for-our-quantum-computing-future)
          to preserve the delicate quantum states long enough for them to be measured.


          Linking a number of smaller processors across a network to create a kind
          of quantum supercomputer is another solution. While quantum information
          can be transmitted in the form of a light wave, the potential for its state
          to be irreversibly corrupted along the way makes it an impractical option.


          Teleportation requires the receipt of measurements the old-fashioned way
          – through reliable binary data. Once sent, operations at the receiving end
          can tweak their own entangled particle until it effectively looks like the
          original.


          The all-important quantum blur of the teleported spin state in the Oxford
          University experiment was an 86 percent match with the original, more than
          good enough for it to serve as a logic gate for a simple operation known
          as a [Grover''s algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm),
          which succeeded with 71 percent efficiency across the two quantum processors.


          "By interconnecting the modules using photonic links, our system gains valuable
          flexibility, allowing modules to be upgraded or swapped out without disrupting

          Having options for restructuring a quantum network could diversify the applications
          for such technology, repurposing networks of computers into tools that can
          measure and test physics at its most fundamental level.

          # New advances promise secure quantum computing at home


          by [University of Oxford](http://www.ox.ac.uk/)


          ![Breakthrough promises secure quantum computing at home](https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2024/breakthrough-promises.jpg)The
          process allows a remote user (right) to access a quantum computer in the
          cloud (left) with complete security. By Helene Hainzer. Copyright Oxford

          The full power of next-generation quantum computing could soon be harnessed
          by millions of individuals and companies, thanks to a breakthrough by scientists
          at Oxford University Physics guaranteeing security and privacy. This advance
          promises to unlock the transformative potential of cloud-based quantum computing
          and is detailed in a new study [published](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.132.150604)
          in _Physical Review Letters_. The paper is titled "Verifiable blind quantum
          computing with trapped ions and single photons."


          Quantum computing is developing rapidly, paving the way for new applications
          that could transform services in many areas like health care and financial
          services. It works in a fundamentally different way than conventional computing
          and is potentially far more powerful. However, it currently requires controlled
          conditions to remain stable and there are concerns around data authenticity
          and the effectiveness of current security and encryption systems.


          Several leading providers of cloud-based services, like Google, Amazon,
          and IBM, already separately offer some elements of quantum computing. Safeguarding
          the privacy and security of customer data is a vital precursor to scaling
          up and expanding its use, and for the development of new applications as
          the technology advances. The new study by researchers at Oxford University
          Physics addresses these challenges.


          "We have shown for the first time that quantum computing in the cloud can
          be accessed in a scalable, practical way which will also give people complete
          security and privacy of data, plus the ability to verify its authenticity,"
          said Professor David Lucas, who co-heads the Oxford University Physics research
          team and is lead scientist at the UK Quantum Computing and Simulation Hub,
          led from Oxford University Physics.

          In the new study, the researchers use an approach dubbed "blind quantum
          computing," which connects two totally separate quantum computing entities—potentially
          an individual at home or in an office accessing a cloud server—in a completely
          secure way. Importantly, their new methods could be scaled up to large quantum
          computations.


          "Using blind quantum computing, clients can access remote quantum computers
          to process confidential data with secret algorithms and even verify the
          results are correct, without revealing any useful information. Realizing
          this concept is a big step forward in both quantum computing and keeping
          our information safe online," said study lead Dr. Peter Drmota, of Oxford
          University Physics.


          The researchers created a system comprising a fiber network link between
          a quantum computing server and a simple device detecting photons, or particles
          of light, at an independent computer remotely accessing its cloud services.
          This allows so-called blind quantum computing over a network.


          Every computation incurs a correction that must be applied to all that follow
          and needs real-time information to comply with the algorithm. The researchers
          used a unique combination of quantum memory and photons to achieve this.

          "Never in history have the issues surrounding privacy of data and code been
          more urgently debated than in the present era of cloud computing and [artificial
          intelligence](https://phys.org/tags/artificial+intelligence/)," said Professor
          David Lucas. "As quantum computers become more capable, people will seek
          to use them with complete security and privacy over networks, and our new
          results mark a step change in capability in this respect."


          The results could ultimately lead to commercial development of devices to
          plug into laptops, to safeguard data when people are using quantum cloud
          computing services.


          Researchers exploring [quantum computing](https://phys.org/tags/quantum+computing/)
          and technologies at Oxford University Physics have access to the state-of-the-art
          Beecroft laboratory facility, specially constructed to create stable and
          secure conditions including eliminating vibration.

          scalable by using fiber optics instead of bulky electrical systems. This
          advancement could enable large-scale quantum computing and even networked
          quantum machines. Credit: SciTechDaily.com


          **Quantum computing takes a leap forward with fiber-optic-connected qubits,
          making large-scale and networked quantum systems more feasible.**


          _Qubits—the building blocks of quantum computing—are driving advancements
          across the tech industry. Among them, superconducting qubits hold great
          promise for large-scale quantum computers. However, they rely on electrical
          signals, making them challenging to scale._


          _In a breakthrough, physicists at the Institute of Science and Technology
          Austria (ISTA) have successfully developed a fully optical readout for superconducting
          qubits, overcoming a key technological hurdle. Their findings, recently
          published in_ Nature Physics _, could pave the way for more scalable and
          efficient quantum computing systems._


          #### The Race for Scalable Quantum Computers Continues


          After a year-long surge, quantum computing stocks came to a sudden halt
          just days into the [International Year of Quantum Science and Technology](https://quantum2025.org/).
          The slowdown was triggered by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s keynote at CES 2025,
          where he predicted that “very useful quantum computers” were still two decades
          away.


          Despite market fluctuations and industry skepticism, the race to build scalable
          quantum computers remains intense. These machines have the potential to
          outperform classical computers in specific calculations, but significant
          technical challenges must be addressed before they become truly practical.

          #### A Breakthrough in Quantum Hardware Scaling


          Now, a team of physicists from Professor Johannes Fink’s group at the Institute
          of Science and Technology Austria (ISTA) has taken a critical step toward
          making quantum computing more viable. They developed a method that allows
          qubits to communicate using fiber optics, significantly reducing the need
          for bulky cryogenic hardware. “This new approach might allow us to increase
          the number of qubits so they become useful for computation.,” explains Georg
          Arnold, a co-first author and former PhD student in the Fink group. “It
          also lays the foundation for building a network of superconducting quantum
          computers connected via optical fibers at room temperature.”


          #### The Challenges of Applying Fiber Optics to Quantum Systems


          While fiberoptics have revolutionized the telecom industry with their multiple
          advantages over electrical transmission and enabled high-speed communication,
          applying optics to quantum hardware is no easy task. Superconducting quantum
          computers, which use special physical properties of materials at temperatures
          near absolute zero, present a challenge of their own.


          To realize superconducting qubits, tiny electrical circuits are cooled to
          extremely low temperatures where they lose all electrical resistance and
          can thus maintain a flowing current indefinitely. “Thus, superconducting
          qubits are electrical by definition. To make them, we must reach temperatures
          of only a few thousandths of a degree above absolute zero. That’s even colder
          than space,” says Arnold.

          of superconducting qubits. Credit: © Nadine Poncioni \| ISTA


          #### Superconducting Qubits and Their Cold Reality


          However, electrical signals have a comparably low bandwidth, meaning they
          transmit little information per unit of time. Easily overwhelmed by noise,
          they are also prone to information loss. Also, the required wiring dissipates
          lots of heat. Thus, the “qubit readout”, i.e., detecting and measuring qubits
          by sending an electric signal that they reflect, requires colossal cryogenic
          cooling as well as elaborate and expensive electrical components for filtering
          and amplification.


          On the other hand, higher-energy optical signals—for example, at telecom
          wavelengths—propagate in thin optical fibers with minuscule losses. In addition,
          they have a considerably lower heat dissipation and much higher bandwidth.
          So, using them to push the limits of superconducting quantum hardware would
          be ideal, if only the qubits would understand their language.


          #### ‘Translating’ Optical Signals for Qubits


          To achieve a fully optical readout in superconducting quantum hardware,
          the team needed to find a way to ‘translate’ the optical signal to the qubits
          and back.


          “Ideally, one would try to get rid of all electrical signals, as the required
          wiring transports a lot of heat into the cooling chambers where the qubits
          are. But this is not possible,” says co-first author Thomas Werner, a PhD
          student in the Fink group at ISTA.


          So, the researchers thought of using an electro-optic transducer to convert
          the optical signal to a microwave frequency—an electrical signal that the
          qubits can understand. In response, the qubits reflect a microwave signal
          that the transducer converts to optics.


          Werner highlights the delicacy of the task, “We showed that we can send
          infrared light close to the qubits without making them lose their superconductivity.”
          Using the electro-optic transducer as a switch allowed the team to connect
          the qubits directly to the outside world.


          #### Breaking the Qubit Barrier: A Scalable Future


          To do ‘useful’ computation with quantum computers, thousands or even millions
          of qubits are necessary. However, the infrastructure has difficulty keeping
          up because the cryogenic cooling requirements to detect and measure them
          are prohibitive. “Our technology can decrease the heat load of measuring
          superconductive qubits considerably. This will allow us to break the qubit
          barrier and scale up the number of qubits that can be used in quantum computing,”
          says Arnold.


          Achieving a fully optical readout of superconducting qubits also allowed
          the researchers to rid the setup of many of its cumbersome electrical components.
          The electrical signal in conventional readout systems is highly error-prone,
          requiring large-scale signal correction using many technically limiting
          and expensive electrical components that must also be cooled to cryogenic
          temperatures. “So, by using the electro-optic transducer to disconnect the
          qubits from the electrical infrastructure, we were able to replace all the
          remaining parts of the setup with optics,” says Werner. This makes the system
          not only more robust and efficient, but also reduces its costs.


          #### Connecting Quantum Computers with Light


          This technology could help increase the number of usable superconducting
          qubits even further by allowing scientists to interface multiple quantum
          computers using light. Currently, quantum computers need so-called “dilution
          refrigerators” to provide cooling for the entire measurement setup, including
          any required connections between processor modules.


          “But these dilution refrigerators also have practical limitations and can’t
          be made infinitely large,” says Arnold. In turn, the space and cooling restrictions
          limit the number of usable qubits. But now, connecting two qubits in two
          separate dilution refrigerators using an optical fiber might be within reach,
          according to the researchers. “The infrastructure is available, and now
          we have the technology that allows us to build the first simple quantum
          computing networks,” says Arnold.


          #### A Step Toward Quantum Networks


          The ISTA physicists have reached a significant milestone in developing superconducting
          quantum hardware, but much more remains to be done. “The performance of
          our prototype is still quite limited—in particular with regard to the amount
          of optical power needed and dissipated. Nevertheless, it serves as a proof
          of principle that a fully optical readout of superconducting qubits is even
          possible. It will be the industry’s role to push the technique further.”

          **Harvard scientists have developed a groundbreaking photon router that
          connects optical signals to superconducting microwave qubits, the building
          blocks of many quantum computers.**


          _This innovation could overcome one of quantum computing’s biggest hurdles:
          getting different quantum systems to “talk” to each other efficiently. The
          key lies in using light, not bulky wires, to control and connect qubits,
          enabling faster, more scalable, and more robust quantum networks. The tiny
          chip-sized device could help bring distributed, fiber-optic-based quantum
          computers closer to reality._


          #### Toward Modular Quantum Networks


          Applied physicists at the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering
          and Applied Sciences (SEAS) have developed a photon router that could one
          day link quantum computers through existing fiber-optic networks. The device
          creates a robust optical interface for quantum systems that rely on microwave
          signals, especially those sensitive to electrical noise.


          This advance brings researchers closer to building modular, distributed
          quantum computing networks. These networks would send quantum information
          over today’s global telecommunications infrastructure, which already moves
          data as pulses of light, called photons, through millions of miles of optical
          fiber.

          #### Bridging the Quantum Gap


          The research team, led by Marko Lončar, the Tiantsai Lin Professor of Electrical
          Engineering and Applied Physics at SEAS, designed a new type of microwave-optical
          quantum transducer. The device enables communication between microwave-based
          superconducting qubits, the quantum equivalent of classical bits, and optical
          signals. Their findings were published today (April 2) in _Nature Physics_.


          Effectively a router for photons, the transducer bridges the large energy
          gap between microwave and optical photons, thus enabling control of microwave
          qubits with optical signals generated many miles away. The device is the
          first of its kind to demonstrate control of a superconducting qubit using
          only light.


          #### Optical Power for Scalable Quantum Systems


          Paper first author and graduate student Hana Warner said the transducer
          offers a way to tap the power of optics when dreaming up quantum networks.
          “The realization of these systems is still a ways out, but in order to get
          there, we need to figure out practical ways to scale and interface with
          the different components,” Warner said. “Optical photons are one of the
          best ways you can do that, because they’re very good carriers of information,
          with low loss, and high bandwidth.”


          Superconducting qubits, which are nanofabricated circuits engineered for
          different energy states, are an emerging quantum computing platform due
          to their scalability, compatibility with existing manufacturing processes,
          and ability to maintain quantum superposition long enough to perform calculations.

          #### Overcoming Low-Temperature Bottlenecks


          But one of the major bottlenecks to deploying superconducting microwave
          qubit platforms is the extremely low temperatures at which they must operate,
          necessitating large cooling systems called dilution refrigerators. Since
          future quantum computing will require millions of qubits to operate, scaling
          these systems only on microwave-frequency signals is challenging. The solution
          lies in using microwave qubits to do the quantum operations, but to use
          optical photons as efficient and scalable interfaces.


          That’s where the transducer comes in.


          #### A Compact Light-Matter Interface


          The Harvard team’s 2-millimeter optical device resembles a paper clip and
          sits on a chip that’s about 2 centimeters in length. It works by linking
          a microwave resonator with two optical resonators, allowing back-and-forth
          exchange of energy enabled by the properties of their base material, [lithium
          niobate](https://seas.harvard.edu/news/2019/04/new-functionality-integrated-photonic-chips).
          The team leveraged this exchange to eliminate the need for bulky, hot microwave
          cables for controlling qubit states.


          The same devices used for control could be used for qubit state readout,
          or for forming direct links to convert finicky quantum information into
          sturdy packets of light between quantum computing nodes. The breakthrough
          brings us closer to a world with superconducting quantum processors connected
          by low-loss, high-powered optical networks.


          #### Entangling the Future


          “The next step for our transducer could be reliable generation and distribution
          of entanglement between microwave qubits using light,” Lončar said.

          # Innovating quantum computers with fluxonium processors

          The next generation of quantum devices requires high-coherence qubits that
          are less error-prone. Responding to this need, researchers at the AQT at
          Berkeley Lab, a state-of-the-art collaborative research laboratory, developed
          a blueprint for a novel quantum processor based on "fluxonium" qubits. Fluxonium
          qubits can outperform the most widely used superconducting qubits, offering
          a promising path toward fault-tolerant universal quantum computing.


          In collaboration with researchers from the University of California, Berkeley,
          and Yale University, the AQT team pioneered a systematic theoretical study
          of how to engineer fluxonium qubits for higher performance while offering
          practical suggestions to adapt and build the cutting-edge hardware that
          will fully harness the potential of quantum computing. Their results were
          published in the journal _PRX Quantum_.


          ## On the leading edge of superconducting processors


          Superconducting quantum processors consist of multiple qubits designed to
          have different transition frequencies facilitating precise control of individual
          qubits and their interactions. The transmon qubit, one of the most widely
          used in the field for superconducting processors, typically has low anharmonicity.
          Anharmonicity is the difference between relevant transition frequencies
          in a qubit. Low anharmonicity contributes to spectral crowding (when qubit
          frequencies are close to resonating with each other), making the [processor](https://phys.org/tags/processor/)
          more difficult to control since qubit frequencies are arranged tightly together.


          In contrast, high anharmonicity allows researchers to have better qubit
          control because there''s less overlap between the frequencies that control
          the qubits and those that drive any given qubit to higher energy levels.
          The fluxonium qubit has inherent advantages for complex superconducting
          processors, such as high anharmonicity, long coherence times, and simple
          control.

          Building on AQT''s robust research and development history on [superconducting
          circuits](https://phys.org/tags/superconducting+circuits/), the team leading
          the fluxonium-based architecture focused on the scalability and adaptability
          of the processor''s main components, with a set of parameters that researchers
          can tune to increase the runtime and fidelity of quantum circuits. Some
          of these adaptations allow simpler operation of the system. Researchers
          proposed, for example, controlling the fluxonium qubits at low frequency
          (1-GHz) via microwave pulses directly generated by an electrical arbitrary
          waveform generator. This straightforward approach allows researchers to
          design processors and set up multiple qubits flexibly.


          ## Flexible approaches with fluxonium qubits for large-scale devices


          Long B. Nguyen is a project scientist at AQT and the paper''s lead author.
          Nguyen started researching alternative superconducting qubits as a University
          of Maryland graduate student working with Professor Vladimir Manucharyan.
          Manucharyan introduced fluxonium qubits to the field just a decade earlier,
          and [in 2019 Nguyen demonstrated the possible longer coherence times with
          fluxonium circuits](https://physics.aps.org/articles/v12/131). The fluxonium
          circuit is composed of three elements: a capacitor, a Josephson Junction,
          and a superinductor, which helps suppress magnetic flux noise—a typical
          source of unwanted interference that affects [superconducting qubits](https://phys.org/tags/superconducting+qubits/)
          and causes decoherence.


          "I always wanted to study new physics, and I focused on fluxonium because
          it appeared to be a better alternative to the transmon at the time. It has
          three circuit elements that I could play with to get the type of spectra
          I wanted. It could be designed to evade decoherence due to material imperfections.
          I also recently realized that scaling up fluxonium is probably more favorable
          since the estimated fabrication yield is high, and the interactions between
          individual qubits can be engineered to have high-fidelity," explained Nguyen.


          To estimate and validate the performance of the proposed fluxonium blueprint,
          the team at AQT, in collaboration with the paper''s researchers, simulated
          two types of programmable quantum logic gates—the cross-resonance controlled-NOT
          (CNOT) and the differential ac-Stark controlled-Z (CZ). The high fidelities
          resulting from the gates'' simulation across the range of proposed qubit
          parameters validated the team''s expectations for the suggested blueprint.


          "We provided a potential path towards building fluxonium processors with
          standard, practical procedures to deploy logic gates with varying frequencies.
          We hope that more R&D on fluxonium and superconducting [qubit](https://phys.org/tags/qubit/)
          alternatives will bring about the next generation of devices for quantum
          information processing," said Nguyen.

          # Quantinuum quantum computer using Microsoft''s ''logical quantum bits''
          runs 14,000 experiments with no errors


          by Bob Yirka , Phys.org

          A team of computer engineers from quantum computer maker Quantinuum, working
          with computer scientists from Microsoft, has found a way to greatly reduce
          errors when running experiments on a quantum computer. The combined group
          has published [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02280) describing their
          work and results on the _arXiv_ preprint server.


          Computer scientists have been working for several years to build a truly
          useful quantum computer that could achieve quantum supremacy. Research has
          come a long way, most of which has involved adding more qubits.


          But such research has been held up by one main problem—quantum computers
          make a lot of errors. To overcome this problem, researchers have been looking
          for ways to reduce the number of errors or to correct those that are made
          before results are produced.


          One of the companies working on reducing errors is Microsoft, and their
          chief focus has been on designing and using logical quantum bits through
          what they describe as "active syndrome extraction"—where a few logical qubits
          are created using multiple physical qubits. The system as a whole is described
          by the team as a qubit virtualization system.


          In this new effort, Microsoft teamed up with Quantinuum, a company in the
          quantum computer hardware business. Quantinuum supplied the H2 computer
          (based on ion-trap qubits) and Microsoft added the logical qubit software.
          Together, they used 30 physical qubits to create four logical qubits.

          The software diagnoses errors and corrects them while calculations are underway
          without destroying the logical qubits via its active syndrome extraction
          technique. The technique involves learning details about the qubits regarding
          noise, rather than measuring them.


          Together, the [research](https://phys.org/tags/research/) team tested their
          approach by running 14,000 experiments on the H2. They found it completed
          all of them without producing a single detectable error. Further testing
          showed that the system had an [error rate](https://phys.org/tags/error+rate/)
          of 1 in 100,000, which is approximately 800 times better than the achievement
          of the same quantum computer without the logical qubits from Microsoft.


          After the testing was completed, Microsoft argued that the team had created
          a Level 2 quantum computer, which is one that has a reasonably low error
          rate and can be scaled up.

        published_date: N/A
        text: "The full power of next-generation quantum computing could soon be harnessed\
          \ by millions of individuals and companies, thanks to a breakthrough by\
          \ scientists at Oxford University Physics guaranteeing security and privacy.\
          \ This advance promises to unlock the transformative potential of cloud-based\
          \ quantum computing and is detailed in a new study published in the influential\
          \ U.S. scientific journal Physical Review Letters . \n Quantum computing\
          \ is developing rapidly, paving the way for new applications which could\
          \ transform services in many areas like healthcare and financial services.\
          \ It works in a fundamentally different way to conventional computing and\
          \ is potentially far more powerful. However, it currently requires controlled\
          \ conditions to remain stable and there are concerns around data authenticity\
          \ and the effectiveness of current security and encryption systems. \n Several\
          \ leading providers of cloud-based services, like Google, Amazon, and IBM,\
          \ already separately offer some elements of quantum computing. Safeguarding\
          \ the privacy and security of customer data is a vital precursor to scaling\
          \ up and expending its use, and for the development of new applications\
          \ as the technology advances. The new study by researchers at Oxford University\
          \ Physics addresses these challenges. \n \"We have shown for the first time\
          \ that quantum computing in the cloud can be accessed in a scalable, practical\
          \ way which will also give people complete security and privacy of data,\
          \ plus the ability to verify its authenticity,\" said Professor David Lucas,\
          \ who co-heads the Oxford University Physics research team and is lead scientist\
          \ at the UK Quantum Computing and Simulation Hub, led from Oxford University\
          \ Physics. \n In the new study, the researchers use an approach dubbed \"\
          blind quantum computing,\" which connects two totally separate quantum computing\
          \ entities -- potentially an individual at home or in an office accessing\
          \ a cloud server -- in a completely secure way. Importantly, their new methods\
          \ could be scaled up to large quantum computations. \n \"Using blind quantum\
          \ computing, clients can access remote quantum computers to process confidential\
          \ data with secret algorithms and even verify the results are correct, without\
          \ revealing any useful information. Realising this concept is a big step\
          \ forward in both quantum computing and keeping our information safe online''\
          \ said study lead Dr Peter Drmota, of Oxford University Physics. \n The\
          \ researchers created a system comprising a fibre network link between a\
          \ quantum computing server and a simple device detecting photons, or particles\
          \ of light, at an independent computer remotely accessing its cloud services.\
          \ This allows so-called blind quantum computing over a network. Every computation\
          \ incurs a correction which must be applied to all that follow and needs\
          \ real-time information to comply with the algorithm. The researchers used\
          \ a unique combination of quantum memory and photons to achieve this. \n\
          \ \"Never in history have the issues surrounding privacy of data and code\
          \ been more urgently debated than in the present era of cloud computing\
          \ and artificial intelligence,\" said Professor David Lucas. \"As quantum\
          \ computers become more capable, people will seek to use them with complete\
          \ security and privacy over networks, and our new results mark a step change\
          \ in capability in this respect.\" \n The results could ultimately lead\
          \ to commercial development of devices to plug into laptops, to safeguard\
          \ data when people are using quantum cloud computing services. \n Researchers\
          \ exploring quantum computing and technologies at Oxford University Physics\
          \ have access to the state-of-the-art Beecroft laboratory facility, specially\
          \ constructed to create stable and secure conditions including eliminating\
          \ vibration. \n Funding for the research came from the UK Quantum Computing\
          \ and Simulation (QCS) Hub, with scientists from the UK National Quantum\
          \ Computing Centre, the Paris-Sorbonne University, the University of Edinburgh,\
          \ and the University of Maryland, collaborating on the work."

          Microsoft says it’s figured out how to [improve error rates in quantum computing](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2024/04/03/how-microsoft-and-quantinuum-achieved-reliable-quantum-computing/),
          bringing quantum computing closer to a commercial state.


          The company worked in collaboration with quantum computing hardware maker
          Quantinuum to improve the performance of the qubit — the very basic unit
          of quantum computing. Qubits work by holding two different phases at once
          (instead of just a one and a zero, it’s both), but they aren’t very stable,
          making it easy for them to lose data. Researchers can now create several
          “logical qubits,” or qubits that are more stable while holding these different
          states.


          Krysta Svore, vice president of advanced quantum development at Microsoft,
          told _The Verge_ in an interview that because qubits are prone to errors,
          researchers needed to find a way to stabilize them.


          “We need reliable quantum computing, and not just in theory; we need to
          demonstrate that it can work in practice,” Svore says. “I like to think
          of it as putting noise-cancelling headphones on the qubits.”


          She says that these more reliable qubits help quantum computing “graduate”
          from level one, the more foundational level with qubits prone to mistakes
          and are usually referred to as noisy, to the next level, where scientists
          can run more calculations correctly and scale up the technology for more
          commercial use.


          Other quantum computing experts welcomed Microsoft and Quantinuum’s advancement.
          Henry Yuen, associate professor of computer science at Columbia and a theoretical
          computer scientist, tells _the Verge_ via email this may just be the beginning
          of more discoveries that make quantum computing easier.


          “We’re far from the final destination, but the signposts are getting more
          frequent and are indicating that some major milestones are coming up soon,”
          Yuen says. “I’m sure there will be bigger and better demonstrations of quantum
          fault tolerance coming soon.”


          Microsoft brought its qubit-virtualization system, which Svore says “abstracts”
          groups of physical qubits together, to Quantiuum’s quantum computer to create
          virtual logical qubits.


          With it, users could create qubits with a longer fault tolerance, or time
          without encountering an error. The team created four reliable logical qubits
          from only 30 physical qubits. Previously, the scientific consensus was that
          hundreds of physical qubits were needed to make a couple of logical qubits
          that didn’t fail, and they would have taken decades to create.


          The teams ran 14,000 calculations without losing the quantum state and found
          they improved the error rate by a factor of 800 over physical qubits. Svore
          says the system could detect and fix errors without destroying the logical
          qubit and keeping the string of calculations going.


          Microsoft is now figuring out how to bring this capability to Azure Quantum
          Elements, its platform for scientists to use AI, high-performance computing,
          and quantum computing to run scientific experiments.


          Yuen says that while he thinks the term “quantum virtualization” may be
          Microsoft’s branding for error-correcting code, its findings could be scalable
          for other quantum computing companies to try on their own.


          Quantum computing has always seemed like far into the future innovation,
          despite the idea and experimentation being around for decades. [Companies
          such as IBM](https://www.theverge.com/23988271/ibm-quantum-heron-system-two-jerry-chow-qubits),
          Microsoft, and [Google have been trying](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443453/google-quantum-computer-2029-decade-commercial-useful-qubits-quantum-transistor)
          to make quantum computing reliable, safe, cost-effective, and, more importantly,
          useful for years.


          Quantinuum chief product officer Ilyas Khan and senior director of offering
          management Jenni Strabley [said in a blog post](https://www.quantinuum.com/news/a-new-breakthrough-in-logical-quantum-computing-reveals-the-scale-of-our-industry-leadership)
          that they plan to continue improving the system to create more reliable
          logical qubits.


          “In the short term – with a hybrid supercomputer powered by a hundred reliable
          logical qubits, we believe that organizations will be able to start to see
          scientific advantages and will be able to accelerate valuable progress toward
          some of the most important problems that mankind faces such as modeling
          the materials used in batteries and hydrogen fuel cells or accelerating
          the development of meaning-aware AI language models,” Quantinuum said in
          its post.


          Now, with Microsoft and Quantiuum’s work, it’s up to others to see if they
          can replicate the same thing.

          [Microsoft](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/MSFT/) and Quantinuum today
          [announced](https://aka.ms/AQBlogMSFTandQ) a major breakthrough in quantum
          error correction. Using Quantinuum’s ion-trap hardware and Microsoft’s new
          qubit-virtualization system, the team was able to run more than 14,000 experiments
          without a single error. This new system also allowed the team to check the
          logical qubits and correct any errors it encountered without destroying
          the logical qubits.


          This, the two companies say, has now moved the state-of-the-art of quantum
          computing out of what has typically been dubbed the era of noisy intermediate
          scale quantum (NISQ) computers. “Noisy” because even the smallest changes
          in the environment can lead a quantum system to essentially become random
          (or “decohere”), and “intermediate scale” because the current generation
          of quantum computers is still limited to just over a thousand qubits at
          best. A qubit is the fundamental unit of computing in quantum systems, analogous
          to a bit in a classic computer, but each qubit can be in multiple states
          at the same time and doesn’t fall into a specific position until measured,
          which underlies the potential of quantum to deliver a huge leap in computing
          power.


          It doesn’t matter how many qubits you have, though, if you barely have time
          to run a basic algorithm before the system becomes too noisy to get a useful
          result — or any result at all.


          Combining several different techniques, the team was able to run thousands
          of experiments with virtually no errors. That involved quite a bit of preparation
          and pre-selecting systems that already looked to be in good shape for a
          successful run, but still, that’s a massive improvement from where the industry
          was just a short while ago.


          It’s a step in the right direction for quantum computing. There are still
          plenty of problems to be solved (and these results need to be replicated,
          too, of course), but theoretically, a computer with 100 of these logical
          qubits could already be useful for solving some problems, while a machine
          with 1,000 qubits could, Microsoft says, “unlock commercial advantage.”

          The team used Quantinuum’s [H2 trapped-ion processor](https://www.quantinuum.com/hardware/h2)
          and was able to combine 30 physical qubits into four highly reliable logical
          qubits. Encoding multiple physical qubits into a single logical qubit helps
          protect the system from errors. The physical qubits are entangled together
          so that it becomes possible to detect an error in a physical qubit and fix
          it.


          It’s this error correction that has long vexed the industry: The lower the
          noise and the higher the quality of the physical qubits, the better, of
          course, but without sophisticated error correction, there is no way out
          of the NISQ era because these systems will all decohere sooner rather than
          later.


          “Merely increasing the number of physical qubits with a high error rate
          — without improving that error rate — is futile because doing so would result
          in a large quantum computer that is not any more powerful than before,”
          Dennis Tom, the general manager for Azure Quantum, and Krysta Svore, the
          VP of Advanced Quantum Development at Microsoft, wrote in today’s announcement.
          “In contrast, when physical qubits with sufficient quality of operation
          are used with a specialized orchestration-and-diagnostics system to enable
          virtual qubits, only then does increasing the number of physical qubits
          result in powerful, fault-tolerant quantum computers able to perform longer,
          more complex computation.”


          It was only [a couple of years ago](https://www.quantinuum.com/news/logical-qubits-start-outperforming-physical-qubits)
          that logical qubits started outperforming physical qubits. Now, Microsoft
          and Quantinuum argue that their new hardware/software system demonstrates
          the largest gap between physical and logical error rates, improving on using
          only physical qubits by up to 800x.

          The researchers note that to move beyond NISQ, a large separation between
          logical and physical qubit error rates is necessary, as is the ability to
          correct individual circuit errors and to generate entanglement between at
          least two logical qubits. If these results hold up, then the team achieved
          all three and we have indeed entered ~~a [stable era](https://three-body-problem.fandom.com/wiki/Stable_Era)~~
          the era of resilient quantum computing.


          As it turns out, the most important result here may actually be the team’s
          ability to perform “active syndrome extraction” — that is, the ability to
          diagnose an error and correct it, without destroying the logical qubit in
          the process.


          “This achievement marks the first step in being able to correct errors while
          not destroying the logical qubits and showcases a fundamental milestone
          in quantum error correction,” Tom and Svore explain. “We demonstrated this
          critical component of reliable quantum computing with our qubit-virtualization
          system, which resulted in a low logical error rate over multiple rounds
          of syndrome extraction.”


          It’ll now be up to the rest of the quantum community to replicate these
          results and implement similar error correction systems. That’s likely just
          a matter of time, though.


          “Today’s results mark a historic achievement and are a wonderful reflection
          of how this collaboration continues to push the boundaries for the quantum
          ecosystem,” said Ilyas Khan, founder and chief product officer of Quantinuum.
          “With Microsoft’s state-of-the-art error correction aligned with the world’s
          most powerful quantum computer and a fully integrated approach, we are so
          excited for the next evolution in quantum applications and can’t wait to
          see how our customers and partners will benefit from our solutions especially
          as we move towards quantum processors at scale.”

          \nFULL STORY\n\n* * *\n\nThe full power of next-generation quantum computing\
          \ could soon be harnessed by millions of individuals and companies, thanks\
          \ to a breakthrough by scientists at Oxford University Physics guaranteeing\
          \ security and privacy. This advance promises to unlock the transformative\
          \ potential of cloud-based quantum computing and is detailed in a new study\
          \ published in the influential U.S. scientific journal _Physical Review\
          \ Letters_.\n\nQuantum computing is developing rapidly, paving the way for\
          \ new applications which could transform services in many areas like healthcare\
          \ and financial services. It works in a fundamentally different way to conventional\
          \ computing and is potentially far more powerful. However, it currently\
          \ requires controlled conditions to remain stable and there are concerns\
          \ around data authenticity and the effectiveness of current security and\
          \ encryption systems.\n\nSeveral leading providers of cloud-based services,\
          \ like Google, Amazon, and IBM, already separately offer some elements of\
          \ quantum computing. Safeguarding the privacy and security of customer data\
          \ is a vital precursor to scaling up and expending its use, and for the\
          \ development of new applications as the technology advances. The new study\
          \ by researchers at Oxford University Physics addresses these challenges.\n\
          \n\"We have shown for the first time that quantum computing in the cloud\
          \ can be accessed in a scalable, practical way which will also give people\
          \ complete security and privacy of data, plus the ability to verify its\
          \ authenticity,\" said Professor David Lucas, who co-heads the Oxford University\
          \ Physics research team and is lead scientist at the UK Quantum Computing\
          \ and Simulation Hub, led from Oxford University Physics.\n\nIn the new\
          \ study, the researchers use an approach dubbed \"blind quantum computing,\"\
          \ which connects two totally separate quantum computing entities -- potentially\
          \ an individual at home or in an office accessing a cloud server -- in a\
          \ completely secure way. Importantly, their new methods could be scaled\
          \ up to large quantum computations.\n\n\"Using blind quantum computing,\
          \ clients can access remote quantum computers to process confidential data\
          \ with secret algorithms and even verify the results are correct, without\
          \ revealing any useful information. Realising this concept is a big step\
          \ forward in both quantum computing and keeping our information safe online''\
          \ said study lead Dr Peter Drmota, of Oxford University Physics.\n\nThe\
          \ researchers created a system comprising a fibre network link between a\
          \ quantum computing server and a simple device detecting photons, or particles\
          \ of light, at an independent computer remotely accessing its cloud services.\
          \ This allows so-called blind quantum computing over a network. Every computation\
          \ incurs a correction which must be applied to all that follow and needs\
          \ real-time information to comply with the algorithm. The researchers used\
          \ a unique combination of quantum memory and photons to achieve this.\n\n\
          \"Never in history have the issues surrounding privacy of data and code\
          \ been more urgently debated than in the present era of cloud computing\
          \ and artificial intelligence,\" said Professor David Lucas. \"As quantum\
          \ computers become more capable, people will seek to use them with complete\
          \ security and privacy over networks, and our new results mark a step change\
          \ in capability in this respect.\"\n\nThe results could ultimately lead\
          \ to commercial development of devices to plug into laptops, to safeguard\
          \ data when people are using quantum cloud computing services.\n\nResearchers\
          \ exploring quantum computing and technologies at Oxford University Physics\
          \ have access to the state-of-the-art Beecroft laboratory facility, specially\
          \ constructed to create stable and secure conditions including eliminating\
          \ vibration.\n\nFunding for the research came from the UK Quantum Computing\
          \ and Simulation (QCS) Hub, with scientists from the UK National Quantum\
          \ Computing Centre, the Paris-Sorbonne University, the University of Edinburgh,\
          \ and the University of Maryland, collaborating on the work.\n\n- [RELATED\

          # Google announces quantum computing chip breakthrough


          ![Google says the Willow chip has it confidently on a path to the kind of
          quantum computing that could tackle seemingly insurmountable real-world
          problems](https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800a/2024/google-says-the-willow.jpg)Google
          says the Willow chip has it confidently on a path to the kind of quantum
          computing that could tackle seemingly insurmountable real-world problems.


          Google on Monday showed off a new quantum computing chip that it said was
          a major breakthrough that could bring practical quantum computing closer
          to reality.


          A custom chip called "Willow" does in minutes what it would take leading
          supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete, according to Google Quantum
          AI founder Hartmut Neven.


          "Written out, there is a 1 with 25 zeros," Neven said of the time span while
          briefing journalists. "A mind-boggling number."


          Neven''s team of about 300 people at Google is on a mission to build quantum
          computing capable of handling otherwise unsolvable problems like safe fusion
          power and stopping climate change.


          "We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum
          computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion
          energy, battery design and more," said Google CEO Sundar Pichai on X.


          A quantum computer that can tackle these challenges is still years away,
          but Willow marks a significant step in that direction, according to Neven
          and members of his team.


          While still in its early stages, scientists believe that superfast quantum
          computing will eventually be able to power innovation in a range of fields.


          Quantum research is seen as a critical field and both the United States
          and China have been investing heavily in the area, while Washington has
          also placed restrictions on the export of the sensitive technology.


          Olivier Ezratty, an independent expert in quantum technologies, told AFP
          in October that private and public investment in the field has totaled around
          $20 billion worldwide over the past five years.


          Regular computers function in binary fashion: they carry out tasks using
          tiny fragments of data known as bits that are only ever either expressed
          as 1 or 0.


          But fragments of data on a quantum computer, known as qubits, can be both
          1 and 0 at the same time—allowing them to crunch an enormous number of potential
          outcomes simultaneously.


          Crucially, Google''s chip demonstrated the ability to reduce computational
          errors exponentially as it scales up—a feat that has eluded researchers
          for nearly 30 years.


          The breakthrough in error correction, published in leading science journal
          _Nature_, showed that adding more qubits to the system actually reduced
          errors rather than increasing them—a fundamental requirement for building
          practical quantum computers.


          Error correction is the "end game" in quantum computing and Google is "confidently
          progressing" along the path, according to Google director of quantum hardware
          Julian Kelly.

          \nFULL STORY\n\n* * *\n\nIn a milestone that brings quantum computing tangibly\
          \ closer to large-scale practical use, scientists at Oxford University Physics\
          \ have demonstrated the first instance of distributed quantum computing.\
          \ Using a photonic network interface, they successfully linked two separate\
          \ quantum processors to form a single, fully connected quantum computer,\
          \ paving the way to tackling computational challenges previously out of\
          \ reach. The results have been published today (5 Feb) in _Nature._\n\n\
          The breakthrough addresses quantum's 'scalability problem': a quantum computer\
          \ powerful enough to be industry-disrupting would have to be capable of\
          \ processing millions of qubits. Packing all these processors in a single\
          \ device, however, would require a machine of an immense size. In this new\
          \ approach, small quantum devices are linked together, enabling computations\
          \ to be distributed across the network. In theory, there is no limit to\
          \ the number of processors that could be in the network.\n\nThe scalable\
          \ architecture is based on modules which each contain only a small number\
          \ of trapped-ion qubits (atomic-scale carriers of quantum information).\
          \ These are linked together using optical fibres, and use light (photons)\
          \ rather than electrical signals to transmit data between them. These photonic\
          \ links enable qubits in separate modules to be entangled\\*, allowing quantum\
          \ logic to be performed across the modules using quantum teleportation.\\\
          *\\*\n\nAlthough quantum teleportation of states has been achieved previously,\
          \ this study is the first demonstration of quantum teleportation of logical\
          \ gates (the minimum components of an algorithm) across a network link.\
          \ According to the researchers, this could lay the groundwork for a future\
          \ 'quantum internet,' where distant processors could form an ultra-secure\
          \ network for communication, computation and sensing.\n\nStudy lead Dougal\
          \ Main from Oxford University Physics, said: \"Previous demonstrations of\
          \ quantum teleportation have focused on transferring quantum states between\
          \ physically separated systems. In our study, we use quantum teleportation\
          \ to _create_ interactions between these distant systems. By carefully tailoring\
          \ these interactions, we can perform logical quantum gates -- the fundamental\
          \ operations of quantum computing -- between qubits housed in separate quantum\
          \ computers. This breakthrough enables us to effectively 'wire together'\
          \ distinct quantum processors into a single, fully-connected quantum computer.\"\
          \n\nThe concept is similar to how traditional supercomputers work. These\
          \ are made up of smaller computers linked together to achieve capabilities\
          \ that are greater than those of each separate unit. This strategy circumvents\
          \ many of the engineering obstacles associated with packing ever larger\
          \ numbers of qubits into a single device, while preserving the delicate\
          \ quantum properties needed for accurate and robust computations.\n\nDougal\
          \ Main added: \"By interconnecting the modules using photonic links, the\
          \ system gains valuable flexibility, allowing modules to be upgraded or\
          \ swapped out without disrupting the entire architecture.\"\n\nThe researchers\
          \ demonstrated the effectiveness of the method by executing Grover's search\
          \ algorithm. This quantum method searches for a particular item in a large,\
          \ unstructured dataset much faster than a regular computer can, using the\
          \ quantum phenomena of superposition and entanglement to explore many possibilities\
          \ in parallel. Its successful demonstration underscores how a distributed\
          \ approach can extend quantum capabilities beyond the limits of a single\
          \ device, setting the stage for scalable, high-performance quantum computers\
          \ powerful enough to run calculations in hours that today's supercomputers\
          \ would take many years to solve.\n\nProfessor David Lucas, principal investigator\
          \ of the research team and lead scientist for the UK Quantum Computing and\
          \ Simulation Hub, led from Oxford University Physics, said: \"Our experiment\
          \ demonstrates that network-distributed quantum information processing is\
          \ feasible with current technology. Scaling up quantum computers remains\
          \ a formidable technical challenge that will likely require new physics\
          \ insights as well as intensive engineering effort over the coming years.\"\
          \n\n\\*Quantum entanglement: Where two particles, such as a pair of photons,\
          \ remain correlated even when separated by vast distances. This allows them\
          \ to share information without having to travel physically.\n\n\\\\*\\\\\
          * Quantum teleportation: The transfer of quantum information over long distances\
          \ almost instantly, using entanglement.\n\n- [RELATED TOPICS](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250205130938.htm)\n\

          Physicists from the University of the Witwatersrand (Wits) have developed
          an innovative computing system using laser beams and everyday display technology,
          marking a significant leap forward in the quest for more powerful quantum
          computing solutions.


          The breakthrough, achieved by researchers at the university''s Structured
          Light Lab, offers a simpler and more cost-effective approach to advanced
          quantum computing by harnessing the unique properties of light. This development
          could potentially speed up complex calculations in fields such as logistics,
          finance and artificial intelligence. The research was [published](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/app/article/9/10/106120/3318401/Emulating-quantum-computing-with-optical-matrix)
          in the journal _APL Photonics_ as the editor''s pick.


          "Traditional computers work like switchboards, processing information as
          simple yes or no decisions. Our approach uses [laser beams](https://phys.org/tags/laser+beams/)
          to process multiple possibilities simultaneously, dramatically increasing
          computing power," says Dr. Isaac Nape, the Optica Emerging Leader Chair
          in Optics at Wits.


          The research team, including MSc students Mwezi Koni and Hadrian Bezuidenhout,
          built their system using surprisingly ordinary components—laser beams, digital
          displays similar to those found in projectors, and simple lenses.


          The key was linking how light interacts with optical devices, such as digital
          displays and lenses, to the [mathematical operations](https://phys.org/tags/mathematical+operations/)
          that a quantum operation in a quantum [computer](https://phys.org/tags/computer/)
          performs. These operations can be simply broken down to multiplication and
          addition (using vectors and matrices) all performed at the speed of light.


          Once this was achieved, they showcased the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm, a clever
          test determining whether an operation performed by a computer is random
          or predictable—something a quantum computer can do far faster than any classical
          computing machine.


          "Our work paves the way for simulating even more complex quantum algorithms,"
          Koni adds. "This could unlock exciting new possibilities in areas like quantum
          optimization and quantum machine learning."


          Their method can handle far more information than conventional computers,
          which are limited to working with just ones and zeros.


          "We''ve shown that our system can work with 16 different levels of information
          instead of just the two used in classical computers," says Koni, who led
          the experiment. "In theory, we could expand this to handle millions of levels,
          which would be a game-changer for processing complex information."


          What makes this development particularly significant for South Africa and
          other emerging economies is its accessibility. The system uses readily available
          equipment, making it a practical option for research laboratories that may
          not have access to more expensive computing technologies.


          "Light is an ideal medium for this kind of computing," says Bezuidenhout.
          "It moves incredibly fast and can process multiple calculations simultaneously.
          This makes it perfect for handling complex problems that would take traditional
          computers much longer to solve."


          The research forms part of the WitsQ Quantum Initiative and is supported
          by the South African Quantum Initiative (SAQuTI), positioning South Africa
          at the forefront of advanced computing [research](https://phys.org/tags/research/).
          The team is now working on expanding their system''s capabilities, which
          could lead to even more powerful computing solutions in the future.


          This [development](https://phys.org/tags/development/) represents a significant
          step forward in making advanced computing more accessible and practical,
          particularly for regions where cutting-edge technology infrastructure might
          be limited by cost constraints.

          # Quantinuum quantum computer using Microsoft''s ''logical quantum bits''
          runs 14,000 experiments with no errors

          A team of computer engineers from quantum computer maker Quantinuum, working
          with computer scientists from Microsoft, has found a way to greatly reduce
          errors when running experiments on a quantum computer. The combined group
          has published [a paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02280) describing their
          work and results on the _arXiv_ preprint server.


          Computer scientists have been working for several years to build a truly
          useful quantum computer that could achieve quantum supremacy. Research has
          come a long way, most of which has involved adding more qubits.


          But such research has been held up by one main problem—quantum computers
          make a lot of errors. To overcome this problem, researchers have been looking
          for ways to reduce the number of errors or to correct those that are made
          before results are produced.


          One of the companies working on reducing errors is Microsoft, and their
          chief focus has been on designing and using logical quantum bits through
          what they describe as "active syndrome extraction"—where a few logical qubits
          are created using multiple physical qubits. The system as a whole is described
          by the team as a qubit virtualization system.


          In this new effort, Microsoft teamed up with Quantinuum, a company in the
          quantum computer hardware business. Quantinuum supplied the H2 computer
          (based on ion-trap qubits) and Microsoft added the logical qubit software.
          Together, they used 30 physical qubits to create four logical qubits.

          The software diagnoses errors and corrects them while calculations are underway
          without destroying the logical qubits via its active syndrome extraction
          technique. The technique involves learning details about the qubits regarding
          noise, rather than measuring them.


          Together, the [research](https://phys.org/tags/research/) team tested their
          approach by running 14,000 experiments on the H2. They found it completed
          all of them without producing a single detectable error. Further testing
          showed that the system had an [error rate](https://phys.org/tags/error+rate/)
          of 1 in 100,000, which is approximately 800 times better than the achievement
          of the same quantum computer without the logical qubits from Microsoft.


          After the testing was completed, Microsoft argued that the team had created
          a Level 2 quantum computer, which is one that has a reasonably low error
          rate and can be scaled up.

      - title: Paving the way to quantum supercomputers
        url: https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2025/02/250205130938.htm
        published_date: N/A
        text: "In a milestone that brings quantum computing tangibly closer to large-scale\
          \ practical use, scientists at Oxford University Physics have demonstrated\
          \ the first instance of distributed quantum computing. Using a photonic\
          \ network interface, they successfully linked two separate quantum processors\
          \ to form a single, fully connected quantum computer, paving the way to\
          \ tackling computational challenges previously out of reach. The results\
          \ have been published today (5 Feb) in Nature. \n The breakthrough addresses\
          \ quantum's 'scalability problem': a quantum computer powerful enough to\
          \ be industry-disrupting would have to be capable of processing millions\
          \ of qubits. Packing all these processors in a single device, however, would\
          \ require a machine of an immense size. In this new approach, small quantum\
          \ devices are linked together, enabling computations to be distributed across\
          \ the network. In theory, there is no limit to the number of processors\
          \ that could be in the network. \n The scalable architecture is based on\
          \ modules which each contain only a small number of trapped-ion qubits (atomic-scale\
          \ carriers of quantum information). These are linked together using optical\
          \ fibres, and use light (photons) rather than electrical signals to transmit\
          \ data between them. These photonic links enable qubits in separate modules\
          \ to be entangled*, allowing quantum logic to be performed across the modules\
          \ using quantum teleportation.** \n Although quantum teleportation of states\
          \ has been achieved previously, this study is the first demonstration of\
          \ quantum teleportation of logical gates (the minimum components of an algorithm)\
          \ across a network link. According to the researchers, this could lay the\
          \ groundwork for a future 'quantum internet,' where distant processors could\
          \ form an ultra-secure network for communication, computation and sensing.\
          \ \n Study lead Dougal Main from Oxford University Physics, said: \"Previous\
          \ demonstrations of quantum teleportation have focused on transferring quantum\
          \ states between physically separated systems. In our study, we use quantum\
          \ teleportation to create interactions between these distant systems. By\
          \ carefully tailoring these interactions, we can perform logical quantum\
          \ gates -- the fundamental operations of quantum computing -- between qubits\
          \ housed in separate quantum computers. This breakthrough enables us to\
          \ effectively 'wire together' distinct quantum processors into a single,\
          \ fully-connected quantum computer.\" \n The concept is similar to how traditional\
          \ supercomputers work. These are made up of smaller computers linked together\
          \ to achieve capabilities that are greater than those of each separate unit.\
          \ This strategy circumvents many of the engineering obstacles associated\
          \ with packing ever larger numbers of qubits into a single device, while\
          \ preserving the delicate quantum properties needed for accurate and robust\
          \ computations. \n Dougal Main added: \"By interconnecting the modules using\
          \ photonic links, the system gains valuable flexibility, allowing modules\
          \ to be upgraded or swapped out without disrupting the entire architecture.\"\
          \ \n The researchers demonstrated the effectiveness of the method by executing\
          \ Grover's search algorithm. This quantum method searches for a particular\
          \ item in a large, unstructured dataset much faster than a regular computer\
          \ can, using the quantum phenomena of superposition and entanglement to\
          \ explore many possibilities in parallel. Its successful demonstration underscores\
          \ how a distributed approach can extend quantum capabilities beyond the\
          \ limits of a single device, setting the stage for scalable, high-performance\
          \ quantum computers powerful enough to run calculations in hours that today's\
          \ supercomputers would take many years to solve. \n Professor David Lucas,\
          \ principal investigator of the research team and lead scientist for the\
          \ UK Quantum Computing and Simulation Hub, led from Oxford University Physics,\
          \ said: \"Our experiment demonstrates that network-distributed quantum information\
          \ processing is feasible with current technology. Scaling up quantum computers\
          \ remains a formidable technical challenge that will likely require new\
          \ physics insights as well as intensive engineering effort over the coming\
          \ years.\" \n *Quantum entanglement: Where two particles, such as a pair\
          \ of photons, remain correlated even when separated by vast distances. This\
          \ allows them to share information without having to travel physically.\
          \ \n ** Quantum teleportation: The transfer of quantum information over\
          \ long distances almost instantly, using entanglement."

      answer: 'Quantum supremacy, or quantum advantage, is achieved when a programmable
        quantum computer solves a problem that a classical computer cannot solve in
        a feasible amount of time, regardless of the problem''s practical usefulness
        ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy)). The
        term was coined in 2011 ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy)).


        In 2019, Google claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy with a 53-qubit
        processor, performing a calculation in 200 seconds that would take a supercomputer
        approximately 10,000 years ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy)).
        However, IBM disputed this, suggesting that an improved classical algorithm
        could solve the problem in 2.5 days ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy)).
        More recently, in March 2024, D-Wave Systems reported an experiment using
        a quantum annealing-based processor that outperformed classical methods, claiming
        quantum supremacy ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy)).
