            **Researchers from USC and Johns Hopkins used two IBM Eagle quantum processors
            to pull off an unconditional, exponential speedup on a classic “guess-the-pattern”
            puzzle, proving—without assumptions—that quantum machines can now outpace
            the best classical computers.**


            _By squeezing extra performance from hardware with shorter circuits, transpilation,
            dynamical decoupling, and error-mitigation, the team finally crossed a
            milestone long called the “holy grail” of quantum computing._


            #### Quantum Exponential Speedup Breakthrough


            Quantum computers have long promised to revolutionize technology, with
            the ability to speed up complex calculations, design new medicines, break
            modern encryption, and uncover exotic new materials. But there’s been
            a major obstacle: noise. That’s the term for all the tiny errors that
            build up during quantum computations, often making these futuristic machines
            less effective than even today’s classical computers.


            Until now.


            A breakthrough led by Daniel Lidar, a professor of engineering at USC
            and an expert in quantum error correction, has pushed quantum computing
            past a key milestone. Working with researchers from USC and Johns Hopkins,
            Lidar’s team demonstrated a powerful exponential speedup using two of
            IBM’s 127-qubit Eagle quantum processors — all operated remotely through
            the cloud. Their results were published in the prestigious journal _Physical
            Review X_.


            “There have previously been demonstrations of more modest types of speedups
            like a polynomial speedup, says Lidar, who is also the cofounder of Quantum
            Elements, Inc. “But an exponential speedup is the most dramatic type of
            speed up that we expect to see from quantum computers.”

            #### What ‘Unconditional’ Exponential Advantage Means


            The key milestone for quantum computing, Lidar says, has always been to
            demonstrate that we can execute entire algorithms with a scaling speedup
            relative to ordinary “classical” computers.


            He clarifies that a scaling speedup doesn’t mean that you can do things,
            say, 100 times faster. “Rather, it’s that as you increase a problem’s
            size by including more variables, the gap between the quantum and the
            classical performance keeps growing. And an exponential speedup means
            that the performance gap roughly doubles for every additional variable.
            Moreover, the speedup we demonstrated is unconditional.”


            What makes a speedup “unconditional,” Lidar explains, is that it doesn’t
            rely on any unproven assumptions. Prior speedup claims required the assumption
            that there is no better classical algorithm against which to benchmark
            the quantum algorithm. Here, the team led by Lidar used an algorithm they
            modified for the quantum computer to solve a variation of “Simon’s problem,”
            an early example of quantum algorithms that can, in theory, solve a task
            exponentially faster than any classical counterpart, unconditionally.


            #### Simon’s Problem: Proving Quantum Supremacy


            Simon’s problem involves finding a hidden repeating pattern in a mathematical
            function and is considered the precursor to what’s known as Shor’s factoring
            algorithm, which can be used to break codes and launched the entire field
            of quantum computing. Simon’s problem is like a guessing game, where the
            players try to guess a secret number known only to the game host (the
            “oracle”). Once a player guesses two numbers for which the answers returned
            by the oracle are identical, the secret number is revealed, and that player
            wins. Quantum players can win this game exponentially faster than classical
            players.


            So, how did the team achieve their exponential speedup? Phattharaporn
            Singkanipa, USC doctoral researcher and first author, says, “The key was
            squeezing every ounce of performance from the hardware: shorter circuits,
            smarter pulse sequences, and statistical error mitigation.”


            #### Four Tricks to Tame Quantum Noise


            The researchers achieved this in four different ways:


            First, they limited the data input by restricting how many secret numbers
            would be allowed (technically, by limiting the number of 1’s in the binary
            representation of the set of secret numbers). This resulted in fewer quantum
            logic operations than would be needed otherwise, which reduced the opportunity
            for error buildup.


            Second, they compressed the number of required quantum logic operations
            as much as possible using a method known as transpilation.


            Third, and most crucially, the researchers applied a method called “dynamical
            decoupling,” which means applying sequences of carefully designed pulses
            to detach the behavior of qubits within the quantum computer from their
            noisy environment and keep the quantum processing on track. Dynamical
            decoupling had the most dramatic impact on their ability to demonstrate
            a quantum speedup.


            Finally, they applied “measurement error mitigation,” a method that finds
            and corrects certain errors that are left over after dynamical decoupling
            due to imperfections in measuring the qubits’ state at the end of the
            algorithm.


            #### Evidence Quantum Edge Is Here


            Says Lidar, who is also a professor of Chemistry and Physics at the USC
            Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Science, “The quantum computing
            community is showing how quantum processors are beginning to outperform
            their classical counterparts in targeted tasks, and are stepping into
            a territory classical computing simply can’t reach., Our result shows
            that already today’s quantum computers firmly lie on the side of a scaling
            quantum advantage.”


            He adds that with this new research, The performance separation cannot
            be reversed because the exponential speedup we’ve demonstrated is, for
            the first time, unconditional.” In other words, the quantum performance
            advantage is becoming increasingly difficult to dispute.


            #### Looking Ahead: From Milestone to Practical Impact


            Lidar cautions that “this result doesn’t have practical applications beyond
            winning guessing games, and much more work remains to be done before quantum
            computers can be claimed to have solved a practical real-world problem.”


            This will require demonstrating speedups that don’t rely on “oracles”
            that know the answer in advance and making significant advances in methods
            for further reducing noise and decoherence in ever larger quantum computers.
            Nevertheless, quantum computers’ previously “on-paper promise” to provide
            exponential speedups has now been firmly demonstrated.

            One key thing that gets in the way: noise or the errors that are produced
            during computations on a quantum machine -- which in fact makes them less

            of Electrical & Computing Engineering at the USC Viterbi School of Engineering,
            has been iterating on quantum error correction, and in a new study along
            with collaborators at USC and Johns Hopkins, has been able to demonstrate
            a quantum exponential scaling advantage, using two 127-qubit IBM Quantum
            Eagle processor-powered quantum computers, over the cloud. The paper,
            "Demonstration of Algorithmic Quantum Speedup for an Abelian Hidden Subgroup
            Problem," was published in APS flagship journal _Physical Review X_.

            College of Letters, Arts and Science, says, "The quantum computing community
            is showing how quantum processors are beginning to outperform their classical
            counterparts in targeted tasks, and are stepping into a territory classical
            computing simply can''t reach., Our result shows that already today''s
            quantum computers firmly lie on the side of a scaling quantum advantage."


            He adds that with this new research, "The performance separation cannot
            be reversed because the exponential speedup we''ve demonstrated is, for
            the first time, unconditional." In other words, the quantum performance
            advantage is becoming increasingly difficult to dispute.


            Lidar cautions that "this result doesn''t have practical applications
            beyond winning guessing games, and much more work remains to be done before
            quantum computers can be claimed to have solved a practical real-world
            problem."


            This will require demonstrating speedups that don''t rely on "oracles"
            that know the answer in advance and making significant advances in methods
            for further reducing noise and decoherence in ever larger quantum computers.
            Nevertheless, quantum computers'' previously "on-paper promise" to provide
            exponential speedups has now been firmly demonstrated.

          text: 'Quantum computers still face a major hurdle on their pathway to practical
            use cases: their limited ability to correct the arising computational
            errors. To develop truly reliable quantum computers, researchers must
            be able to simulate quantum computations using conventional computers
            to verify their correctness - a vital yet extraordinarily difficult task.
            Now, in a world-first, researchers from Chalmers University of Technology
            in Sweden, the University of Milan, the University of Granada, and the
            University of Tokyo have unveiled a method for simulating specific types
            of error-corrected quantum computations - a significant leap forward in
            the quest for robust quantum technologies.


            Quantum computers have the potential to solve complex problems that no
            supercomputer today can handle. In the foreseeable future, quantum technology''s
            computing power is expected to revolutionise fundamental ways of solving
            problems in medicine, energy, encryption, AI, and logistics.


            Despite these promises, the technology faces a major challenge: the need
            for correcting the errors arising in a quantum computation. While conventional
            computers also experience errors, these can be quickly and reliably corrected
            using well-established techniques before they can cause problems. In contrast,
            quantum computers are subject to far more errors, which are additionally
            harder to detect and correct. Quantum systems are still not fault-tolerant
            and therefore not yet fully reliable.


            To verify the accuracy of a quantum computation, researchers simulate
            - or mimic - the calculations using conventional computers. One particularly
            important type of quantum computation that researchers are therefore interested
            in simulating is one that can withstand disturbances and effectively correct
            errors. However, the immense complexity of quantum computations makes
            such simulations extremely demanding - so much so that, in some cases,
            even the world''s best conventional supercomputer would take the age of
            the universe to reproduce the result.


            Researchers from Chalmers University of Technology, the University of
            Milan, the University of Granada and the University of Tokyo have now
            become the first in the world to present a method for accurately simulating
            a certain type of quantum computation that is particularly suitable for
            error correction, but which thus far has been very difficult to simulate.
            The breakthrough tackles a long-standing challenge in quantum research.


            "We have discovered a way to simulate a specific type of quantum computation
            where previous methods have not been effective. This means that we can
            now simulate quantum computations with an error correction code used for
            fault tolerance, which is crucial for being able to build better and more
            robust quantum computers in the future," says Cameron Calcluth, PhD in
            Applied Quantum Physics at Chalmers and first author of a study recently
            published in _Physical Review Letters_.


            **Error-correcting quantum computations - demanding yet crucial**


            The limited ability of quantum computers to correct errors stems from
            their fundamental building blocks - qubits - which have the potential
            for immense computational power but are also highly sensitive. The computational
            power of quantum computers relies on the quantum mechanical phenomenon
            of superposition, meaning qubits can simultaneously hold the values 1
            and 0, as well as all intermediate states, in any combination. The computational
            capacity increases exponentially with each additional qubit, but the trade-off
            is their extreme susceptibility to disturbances.


            "The slightest noise from the surroundings in the form of vibrations,
            electromagnetic radiation, or a change in temperature can cause the qubits
            to miscalculate or even lose their quantum state, their coherence, thereby
            also losing their capacity to continue calculating," says Calcluth.


            To address this issue, error correction codes are used to distribute information
            across multiple subsystems, allowing errors to be detected and corrected
            without destroying the quantum information. One way is to encode the quantum
            information of a qubit into the multiple - possibly infinite - energy
            levels of a vibrating quantum mechanical system. This is called a bosonic
            code. However, simulating quantum computations with bosonic codes is particularly
            challenging because of the multiple energy levels, and researchers have
            been unable to reliably simulate them using conventional computers - until
            now.


            **New mathematical tool key in the researchers'' solution**


            The method developed by the researchers consists of an algorithm capable
            of simulating quantum computations that use a type of bosonic code known
            as the Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) code. This code is commonly used
            in leading implementations of quantum computers.


            "The way it stores quantum information makes it easier for quantum computers
            to correct errors, which in turn makes them less sensitive to noise and
            disturbances. Due to their deeply quantum mechanical nature, GKP codes
            have been extremely difficult to simulate using conventional computers.
            But now we have finally found a unique way to do this much more effectively
            than with previous methods," says Giulia Ferrini, Associate Professor
            of Applied Quantum Physics at Chalmers and co-author of the study.


            The researchers managed to use the code in their algorithm by creating
            a new mathematical tool. Thanks to the new method, researchers can now
            more reliably test and validate a quantum computer''s calculations.


            "This opens up entirely new ways of simulating quantum computations that
            we have previously been unable to test but are crucial for being able
            to build stable and scalable quantum computers," says Ferrini.

            **Oxford scientists have set a world record for quantum precision, achieving
            just one error in 6.7 million operations using microwave-controlled ions.**


            _This advancement could drastically shrink the size and cost of future
            quantum computers._


            #### Record-Breaking Quantum Accuracy


            Physicists at the [University of Oxford](https://scitechdaily.com/tag/university-of-oxford/)
            have set a new world record for how accurately a quantum bit, or qubit,
            can be controlled. They achieved the lowest error rate ever measured in
            a quantum logic operation: just 0.000015 percent. That’s only one error
            in 6.7 million operations! That’s nearly ten times better than the previous
            record, which was also set by the same team a decade ago.


            To put it into perspective, you’re more likely to be struck by lightning
            this year ( [1 in 1.2 million](https://www.weather.gov/safety/lightning-odds))
            than for one of Oxford’s quantum gates to make a mistake.

            Laboratory, Department of Physics, University of Oxford. From left to

            #### Toward Practical Quantum Computing


            The findings, published recently in _Physical Review Letters_ _,_ are
            a major advance towards having robust and useful quantum computers.


            “As far as we are aware, this is the most accurate qubit operation ever
            recorded anywhere in the world,” said Professor David Lucas, co-author
            on the paper, from the University of Oxford’s Department of Physics. “It
            is an important step toward building practical quantum computers that
            can tackle real-world problems.”


            To perform useful calculations on a quantum computer, millions of operations
            will need to be run across many qubits. This means that if the error rate
            is too high, the final result of the calculation will be meaningless.
            Although error correction can be used to fix mistakes, this comes at the
            cost of requiring many more qubits. By reducing the error, the new method
            reduces the number of qubits required and consequently the cost and size
            of the quantum computer itself.

            #### Fewer Qubits, Smaller Machines


            Co-lead author Molly Smith (Graduate Student, Department of Physics, University
            of Oxford), said: “By drastically reducing the chance of error, this work
            significantly reduces the infrastructure required for error correction,
            opening the way for future quantum computers to be smaller, faster, and
            more efficient. Precise control of qubits will also be useful for other
            quantum technologies such as clocks and quantum sensors.”


            This unprecedented level of precision was achieved using a trapped calcium
            ion as the qubit (quantum bit). These are a natural choice to store quantum
            information due to their long lifetime and robustness. Unlike the conventional
            approach, which uses lasers, the Oxford team controlled the quantum state
            of the calcium ions using electronic (microwave) signals.

            #### Microwaves Over Lasers


            This method offers greater stability than laser control and also has other
            benefits for building a practical quantum computer. For instance, electronic
            control is much cheaper and more robust than lasers, and easier to integrate
            in ion trapping chips. Furthermore, the experiment was conducted at room
            temperature and without magnetic shielding, thus simplifying the technical
            requirements for a working quantum computer.


            The previous best single-qubit error rate, [also achieved by the Oxford
            team, in 2014](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.220501), was 1
            in 1 million. The group’s expertise led to the launch of the spinout company
            [Oxford Ionics](https://www.oxionics.com/) in 2019, which has become an
            established leader in high-performance trapped-ion qubit platforms.


            #### The Bigger Challenge Ahead


            Whilst this record-breaking result marks a major milestone, the research
            team caution that it is part of a larger challenge. Quantum computing
            requires both single- and two-qubit gates to function together. Currently,
            two-qubit gates still have significantly higher error rates—around 1 in
            2000 in the best demonstrations to date—so reducing these will be crucial
            to building fully fault-tolerant quantum machines.

        - title: 'Quantum Breakthrough: Qubit Coherence Hits Record Millisecond Milestone'
          url: https://thedebrief.org/quantum-breakthrough-qubit-coherence-hits-record-millisecond-milestone/
          published_date: N/A
          text: 'In the race toward practical [quantum computing](https://thedebrief.org/smarter-colder-faster-quantum-amplifier-breakthrough-makes-quantum-computing-up-10x-more-efficient/),
            researchers in Finland have achieved a new milestone by extending the
            coherence times of a [superconducting transmon qubit](https://thedebrief.org/scientists-achieve-the-impossible-unlocking-room-temperature-quantum-circuits-using-magnetic-graphene/)
            to near one millisecond, shattering previous records and bringing us a
            step closer to fault-tolerant quantum computation.


            In a newly published study in _[Nature Communications](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-61126-0)_,
            scientists from Aalto University and the VTT Technical Research Centre
            of Finland report that their transmon qubit demonstrated energy relaxation
            and echo dephasing times well beyond any values previously reported for
            this type of qubit.


            One of the devices achieved an echo dephasing time exceeding 1 millisecond
            (1.057 ms)—more than triple the best figures in recent literature.


            “We have just measured an echo coherence time for a transmon qubit that
            landed at a millisecond at maximum with a median of half a millisecond,”
            study author and PhD student at Aalto University, Mikko Tuokkola, said
            in a [press release](https://www.aalto.fi/en/news/new-quantum-record-transmon-qubit-coherence-reaches-millisecond-threshold).
            “The median reading is particularly significant, as it also surpasses
            current recorded readings.”


            For context, coherence time refers to the duration during which a quantum
            bit, or qubit, can maintain its quantum state before succumbing to environmental
            noise and decoherence.


            Two key metrics—energy relaxation time (T1) and echo dephasing time (T₂)—define
            how long a qubit remains viable for computation. Historically, coherence
            has been a bottleneck, limiting the number of operations a qubit can perform
            before errors begin to creep in.


            The team’s record-setting transmon qubit hit a median energy relaxation
            time of 425 microseconds, with a maximum of 666 microseconds and a median
            echo dephasing time of 541 microseconds, peaking at 1,057 microseconds.
            By comparison, previous top-tier transmon devices typically achieved T1
            and T2 times below 400 microseconds.


            “These results surpass the previous results for a transmon qubit reported
            in the literature,” researchers write. “This result represents a significant
            step in the development of high-coherence superconducting qubits by approaching
            the millisecond mark for the energy relaxation and dephasing times of
            a transmon qubit.”


            Transmon qubits, first introduced in 2007, are the workhorse of today’s
            superconducting [quantum computing](https://thedebrief.org/new-impossible-material-leads-researchers-to-a-quantum-computing-breakthrough/)
            architectures, including those developed by Google, IBM, and others. Their
            design leverages Josephson junctions and a shunt capacitor to suppress
            noise, making them well-suited for scalable architectures. However, even
            minor improvements in coherence can have a significant impact on error
            rates and computational reliability.


            What makes this result especially significant is that it wasn’t a lucky
            one-off. The team emphasized the focus on reproducibility, with detailed
            breakdowns of their fabrication and measurement techniques included in
            the publication. This provides a roadmap for other research groups and
            companies seeking to replicate or build upon this achievement.


            “We present detailed information on our design, fabrication methods, and
            measurement setup for a high-coherence transmon qubit,” the authors note.
            “Detailed reporting of a high-coherence qubit will benefit the research
            community and accelerate the global efforts on developing quantum sensors,
            quantum simulators, and quantum computers based on superconducting quantum
            technologies.”


            To reach this milestone, the researchers used a combination of innovations.
            These included optimized niobium patterning, refined Josephson junction
            fabrication using a precise electron-beam lithography process, and highly
            controlled thermal and chemical treatments to reduce imperfections and
            prevent decoherence.


            One of the key tools in their setup was the use of a traveling-wave parametric
            amplifier (TWPA), which amplifies readout signals without significantly
            adding noise. Although the TWPA didn’t directly increase the coherence
            times, it improved the accuracy of the measurements by enhancing signal
            clarity.


            Notably, the team’s second measurement run, conducted after re-cooling
            the system, still demonstrated strong coherence—though not quite matching
            the peak times observed initially. This drop, they say, was likely due
            to oxidation and environmental changes during storage and handling, underscoring
            the delicate nature of maintaining high coherence even after fabrication.


            “Our fabrication method and experimental setup can also be applied to
            other types of superconducting qubits, such as the unimon qubit, to enhance
            its energy relaxation and dephasing times, and also to large-scale manufacturing,”
            researchers write.


            This progress is especially timely as [quantum hardware developers](https://thedebrief.org/quantum-computing-breakthrough-photon-router-transforms-microwave-qubits-into-light-pulses/)
            push for error-corrected quantum processors. Current state-of-the-art
            systems still struggle with fidelity, requiring substantial redundancy
            to compensate for errors introduced by the limited lifetimes of qubits.
            Pushing coherence into the millisecond range could dramatically reduce
            these overheads and unlock more efficient quantum processing.


            Researchers have noted that with this latest breakthrough, Finland further
            solidifies its reputation as a rising [quantum powerhouse,](https://thedebrief.org/google-deepminds-breakthrough-alphaqubit-closing-in-on-the-holy-grail-of-quantum-computing/)
            joining the ranks of nations such as the United States, China, and the
            Netherlands in pioneering [next-generation computing](https://thedebrief.org/new-research-could-make-small-quantum-computers-a-bigger-part-of-our-future/)
            technology.


            “We have been able to reproducibly fabricate high-quality transmon qubits,”
            co-author and postdoctoral Scholar at Stanford University, Dr. Yoshiki
            Sunada, explained. “The fact that this can be achieved in a cleanroom
            which is accessible for academic research is a testament to Finland’s
            leading position in quantum science and technology.”


            Backed by funding from the Research Council of Finland, the European Research
            Council, and the Finnish Quantum Institute, the project demonstrates how
            strategic investment in quantum research can yield world-leading results.


            “This landmark achievement has strengthened Finland’s standing as a global
            leader in the field,” co-author and head of Aalto’s Quantum Computing

            needle forward on what can be made possible with the quantum computers

        - title: Microsoft's Majorana 1 chip carves new path for quantum computing
          url: https://news.microsoft.com/source/features/innovation/microsofts-majorana-1-chip-carves-new-path-for-quantum-computing/
          published_date: N/A
          text: 'Microsoft today [introduced Majorana 1](https://news.microsoft.com/azure-quantum/),
            the world’s first quantum chip powered by a new Topological Core architecture
            that it expects will realize quantum computers capable of solving meaningful,
            industrial-scale problems in years, not decades.


            It leverages the world’s first topoconductor, a breakthrough type of material
            which can observe and control Majorana particles to produce more reliable
            and scalable qubits, which are the building blocks for quantum computers.


            In the same way that the invention of semiconductors made today’s smartphones,
            computers and electronics possible, [topoconductors and the new type of
            chip they enable](https://aka.ms/MSQuantumAQblog) offer a path to developing
            quantum systems that can scale to a million qubits and are capable of
            tackling the most complex industrial and societal problems, Microsoft
            said.


            “We took a step back and said ‘OK, let’s invent the transistor for the
            quantum age. What properties does it need to have?’” said Chetan Nayak,
            Microsoft technical fellow. “And that’s really how we got here – it’s
            the particular combination, the quality and the important details in our
            new materials stack that have enabled a new kind of qubit and ultimately
            our entire architecture.”

            This new architecture used to develop the Majorana 1 processor offers
            a clear path to fit a million qubits on a single chip that can fit in
            the palm of one’s hand, Microsoft said. This is a needed threshold for
            quantum computers to deliver transformative, real-world solutions – such
            as breaking down microplastics into harmless byproducts or inventing self-healing
            materials for construction, manufacturing or healthcare. All the world’s
            current computers operating together can’t do what a one-million-qubit
            quantum computer will be able to do.


            “Whatever you’re doing in the quantum space needs to have a path to a
            million qubits. If it doesn’t, you’re going to hit a wall before you get
            to the scale at which you can solve the really important problems that
            motivate us,” Nayak said.  “We have actually worked out a path to a million.”


            The topoconductor, or topological superconductor, is a special category
            of material that can create an entirely new state of matter – not a solid,
            liquid or gas but a topological state. This is harnessed to produce a
            more stable qubit that is fast, small and can be digitally controlled,
            without the tradeoffs required by current alternatives. A new paper published
            Wednesday in Nature outlines how Microsoft researchers were able to create
            the topological qubit’s exotic quantum properties and also accurately
            measure them, an essential step for practical computing.

            This breakthrough required developing an entirely new materials stack
            made of indium arsenide and aluminum, much of which Microsoft designed
            and fabricated atom by atom. The goal was to coax new quantum particles
            called Majoranas into existence and take advantage of their unique properties
            to reach the next horizon of quantum computing, Microsoft said.


            The world’s first Topological Core powering the Majorana 1 is reliable
            by design, incorporating error resistance at the hardware level making
            it more stable.


            Commercially important applications will also require trillions of operations
            on a million qubits, which would be prohibitive with current approaches
            that rely on fine-tuned analog control of each qubit. The Microsoft team’s
            new measurement approach enables qubits to be controlled digitally, redefining
            and vastly simplifying how quantum computing works.


            This progress validates Microsoft’s choice years ago to pursue a topological
            qubit design – a high risk, high reward scientific and engineering challenge
            that is now paying off. Today, the company has placed eight topological
            qubits on a chip designed to scale to one million.

            Microsoft.


            “From the start we wanted to make a quantum computer for commercial impact,
            not just thought leadership,” said Matthias Troyer, Microsoft technical
            fellow. “We knew we needed a new qubit. We knew we had to scale.”


            That approach led the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA),
            a federal agency that invests in breakthrough technologies that are important
            to national security, to include Microsoft in a rigorous program to evaluate
            whether innovative quantum computing technologies could build commercially
            relevant quantum systems faster than conventionally believed possible.


            Microsoft is now one of two companies to be [invited to move to the final
            phase](https://www.darpa.mil/news/2025/quantum-computing-approaches) of
            DARPA’s Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC)
            program – one of the programs that makes up DARPA’s larger [Quantum Benchmarking
            Initiative](https://www.darpa.mil/research/programs/quantum-benchmarking-initiative)
            – which aims to deliver the industry’s first utility-scale fault-tolerant
            quantum computer, or one whose computational value exceeds its costs.


            ## ‘It just gives you the answer’


            In addition to making its own quantum hardware, Microsoft has partnered
            with Quantinuum and Atom Computing to reach [scientific and engineering
            breakthroughs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2024/09/10/microsoft-and-quantinuum-create-12-logical-qubits-and-demonstrate-a-hybrid-end-to-end-chemistry-simulation/)
            with today’s qubits, including the announcement last year of the [industry’s
            first reliable quantum computer](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2024/11/19/microsoft-and-atom-computing-offer-a-commercial-quantum-machine-with-the-largest-number-of-entangled-logical-qubits-on-record/?msockid=0d710b8d313360371e1f1f27301e6148).


            These types of machines [offer important opportunities to develop quantum
            skills](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/quantum/2025/01/14/2025-the-year-to-become-quantum-ready/?msockid=0d710b8d313360371e1f1f27301e6148),
            build hybrid applications and drive new discovery, particularly as AI
            is combined with new quantum systems that will be powered by larger numbers
            of reliable qubits. Today, Azure Quantum offers a [suite of integrated
            solutions](https://quantum.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/azure-quantum-solutions)
            allowing customers to leverage these leading AI, high performance computing
            and quantum platforms in Azure to advance scientific discovery.


            But reaching the next horizon of quantum computing will require a quantum
            architecture that can provide a million qubits or more and reach trillions
            of fast and reliable operations. Today’s announcement puts that horizon
            within years, not decades, Microsoft said.


            Because they can use quantum mechanics to mathematically map how nature
            behaves with incredible precision – from chemical reactions to molecular
            interactions and enzyme energies – million-qubit machines should be able
            to solve certain types of problems in chemistry, materials science and
            other industries that are impossible for today’s classical computers to
            accurately calculate.


            - For instance, they could help solve the difficult chemistry question
            of why materials suffer corrosion or cracks. This could lead to self-healing
            materials that repair cracks in bridges or airplane parts, shattered phone
            screens or scratched car doors.


            - Because there are so many types of plastics, it isn’t currently possible
            to find a one-size-fits-all catalyst that can break them down – especially
            important for cleaning up microplastics or tackling carbon pollution.
            Quantum computing could calculate the properties of such catalysts to
            break down pollutants into valuable byproducts or develop non-toxic alternatives
            in the first place.


            - Enzymes, a kind of biological catalyst, could be harnessed more effectively
            in healthcare and agriculture, thanks to accurate calculations about their
            behavior that only quantum computing can provide. This could lead to breakthroughs
            helping to eradicate global hunger: boosting soil fertility to increase
            yields or promoting sustainable growth of foods in harsh climates.


            Most of all, quantum computing could allow engineers, scientists, companies
            and others to simply design things right the first time – which would
            be transformative for everything from healthcare to product development.
            The power of quantum computing, combined with AI tools, would allow someone
            to describe what kind of new material or molecule they want to create
            in plain language and get an answer that works straightaway – no guesswork
            or years of trial and error.


            “Any company that makes anything could just design it perfectly the first
            time out. It would just give you the answer,” Troyer said. “The quantum
            computer teaches the AI the language of nature so the AI can just tell
            you the recipe for what you want to make.”


            ## Rethinking quantum computing at scale


            The quantum world operates according to the laws of quantum mechanics,
            which are not the same laws of physics that govern the world we see. The
            particles are called qubits, or quantum bits, analogous to the bits, or
            ones and zeros, that computers now use.


            Qubits are finicky and highly susceptible to perturbations and errors
            that come from their environment, which cause them to fall apart and information
            to be lost. Their state can also be affected by measurement – a problem
            because measuring is essential for computing. An inherent challenge is
            developing a qubit that can be measured and controlled, while offering
            protection from environmental noise that corrupts them.


            Qubits can be created in different ways, each with advantages and disadvantages.
            Nearly 20 years ago, Microsoft decided to pursue a unique approach: developing
            topological qubits, which it believed would offer more stable qubits requiring
            less error correction, thereby unlocking speed, size and controllability
            advantages. The approach posed a steep learning curve, requiring uncharted
            scientific and engineering breakthroughs, but also the most promising
            path to creating scalable and controllable qubits capable of doing commercially
            valuable work.


            The disadvantage is – or was – that until recently the exotic particles
            Microsoft sought to use, called Majoranas, had never been seen or made.
            They don’t exist in nature and can only be coaxed into existence with
            magnetic fields and superconductors. The difficulty of developing the
            right materials to create the exotic particles and their associated topological
            state of matter is why most quantum efforts have focused on other kinds
            of qubits.


            The Nature paper marks peer-reviewed confirmation that Microsoft has not
            only been able to create Majorana particles, which help protect quantum
            information from random disturbance, but can also reliably measure that
            information from them using microwaves.


            Majoranas hide quantum information, making it more robust, but also harder
            to measure. The Microsoft team’s new measurement approach is so precise
            it can detect the difference between one billion and one billion and one
            electrons in a superconducting wire – which tells the computer what state
            the qubit is in and forms the basis for quantum computation.


            The measurements can be turned on and off with voltage pulses, like flicking
            a light switch, rather than finetuning dials for each individual qubit.
            This simpler measurement approach that enables digital control simplifies
            the quantum computing process and the physical requirements to build a
            scalable machine.


            Microsoft’s topological qubit also has an advantage over other qubits
            because of its size. Even for something that tiny, there’s a “Goldilocks”
            zone, where a too-small qubit is hard to run control lines to, but a too-big
            qubit requires a huge machine, Troyer said. Adding the individualized
            control technology for those types of qubits would require building an
            impractical computer the size of an airplane hangar or football field.


            Majorana 1, Microsoft’s quantum chip that contains both qubits as well
            as surrounding control electronics, can be held in the palm of one’s hand
            and fits neatly into a quantum computer that can be easily deployed inside
            Azure datacenters.


            “It’s one thing to discover a new state of matter,” Nayak said. “It’s
            another to take advantage of it to rethink quantum computing at scale.”


            ## Designing quantum materials atom by atom


            Microsoft’s topological qubit architecture has aluminum nanowires joined
            together to form an H. Each H has four controllable Majoranas and makes
            one qubit. These Hs can be connected, too, and laid out across the chip
            like so many tiles.


            “It’s complex in that we had to show a new state of matter to get there,
            but after that, it’s fairly simple. It tiles out. You have this much simpler
            architecture that promises a much faster path to scale,” said Krysta Svore,
            Microsoft technical fellow.

            The quantum chip doesn’t work alone. It exists in an ecosystem with control
            logic, a dilution refrigerator that keeps qubits at temperatures much
            colder than outer space and a software stack that can integrate with AI
            and classical computers. All those pieces exist, built or modified entirely
            in-house, she said.


            To be clear, continuing to refine those processes and getting all the
            elements to work together at accelerated scale will require more years
            of engineering work. But many difficult scientific and engineering challenges
            have now been met, Microsoft said.


            Getting the materials stack right to produce a topological state of matter
            was one of the hardest parts, Svore added. Instead of silicon, Microsoft’s
            topoconductor is made of indium arsenide, a material currently used in
            such applications as infrared detectors and which has special properties.
            The semiconductor is married with superconductivity, thanks to extreme
            cold, to make a hybrid.


            “We are literally spraying atom by atom. Those materials have to line
            up perfectly. If there are too many defects in the material stack, it
            just kills your qubit,” Svore said.


            “Ironically, it’s also why we need a quantum computer – because understanding
            these materials is incredibly hard. With a scaled quantum computer, we
            will be able to predict materials with even better properties for building
            the next generation of quantum computers beyond scale,” she said.

          published_date: N/A
          text: 'Quantum computing (QC), once a theoretical concept confined to academic
            research, has rapidly evolved into one of the most exciting and promising
            fields in technology. As we move through 2024, QC is inching closer to
            practical applications that could revolutionize industries from cryptography
            to drug discovery. However, alongside these breakthroughs come significant
            challenges that must be addressed before quantum computing can reach its
            full potential. Let’s explore the latest developments in quantum computing,
            the obstacles that remain, and what the future may hold for this transformative
            technology.


            ## Breakthroughs in Quantum Computing in 2024


            2024 has been a year of significant progress in the field of QC, with
            several key breakthroughs that are bringing us closer to realizing its
            potential:


            **1\. Increased Qubit Stability and Error Correction**


            One of the most critical challenges in quantum computing has always been
            maintaining the stability of qubits—the basic units of quantum information.
            In 2024, researchers have made notable advancements in error correction
            techniques, which are essential for stabilizing qubits and reducing the
            errors that occur during quantum computations. Improved error correction
            codes and the development of more stable qubits, such as topological qubits,
            have pushed the boundaries of what is possible, bringing us closer to
            achieving reliable quantum computing.


            **2\. Quantum Supremacy Milestones**


            Quantum supremacy—the point at which a quantum computer can solve a problem
            that classical computers cannot—has been a hot topic in recent years.
            In 2024, several QC firms and research institutions have announced new
            milestones in this area. While there is still debate over what constitutes
            true quantum supremacy, the latest demonstrations have shown quantum computers
            tackling increasingly complex problems, outpacing their classical counterparts
            in specific tasks such as complex simulations and optimization problems.


            **3\. Advancements in Quantum Algorithms**


            The development of quantum algorithms has seen significant progress in
            2024. New algorithms designed to take advantage of quantum computing’s
            unique capabilities are being developed, offering the potential to solve
            problems in fields such as cryptography, materials science, and machine
            learning more efficiently than ever before. For instance, advances in
            quantum algorithms for factoring large numbers have implications for breaking
            traditional encryption methods, a development that could reshape the field
            of [cybersecurity](https://microtime.com/cybersecurity-services/).


            **4\. Commercial Quantum [Cloud Services](https://microtime.com/cloud-computing/)**


            Quantum computing is gradually becoming more accessible, thanks to the
            expansion of quantum [cloud services](https://microtime.com/cloud-computing/)
            offered by tech giants such as IBM, Google, and Amazon. In 2024, these
            platforms have introduced more powerful quantum processors, allowing businesses
            and researchers to experiment with QC without needing to build and maintain
            their own quantum hardware. These services are making it easier for organizations
            to explore quantum computing applications in a real-world context, accelerating
            innovation across industries.


            ## Challenges Facing Quantum Computing


            Despite these exciting breakthroughs, significant challenges remain before
            quantum computing can be fully realized and integrated into everyday use:


            **1\. Scalability Issues**


            While qubit stability has improved, scaling quantum computers to the level
            necessary for solving large, complex problems remains a daunting challenge.
            Building quantum computers with millions of qubits that can operate reliably
            in tandem is still beyond our current capabilities. As researchers work
            to overcome these scalability issues, the goal of creating large-scale
            quantum computers remains on the horizon.


            **2\. Quantum Error Correction**


            Although error correction has improved, it is not yet at the level required
            for fully fault-tolerant QC. Quantum systems are inherently susceptible
            to noise and decoherence, which can introduce errors into computations.
            Developing more efficient and effective error correction methods is essential
            for the future of quantum computing, and remains an active area of research
            in 2024.


            **3\. Hardware Limitations**


            The physical construction of quantum computers presents significant engineering
            challenges. Quantum processors need to operate at extremely low temperatures,
            close to absolute zero, and are highly sensitive to environmental disturbances.
            Maintaining the delicate balance required for quantum operations is difficult,
            and building robust, reliable quantum hardware that can function outside
            of highly controlled laboratory environments is still a major hurdle.


            **4\. Security Concerns**


            The potential of QC to break current cryptographic systems is both a promise
            and a threat. As quantum computers become more powerful, they could render
            many of the encryption methods that secure today’s digital communications
            obsolete. This has led to a race to develop quantum-resistant cryptography,
            but widespread adoption is still years away. The looming threat of quantum-enabled
            cyberattacks is a significant concern for governments and industries worldwide.


            **5\. High Costs and Accessibility**


            Quantum computing technology remains expensive, and the expertise required
            to work with quantum systems is still relatively rare. This limits access
            to QC for many businesses and researchers, particularly smaller organizations
            without the resources to invest in cutting-edge technology. While quantum
            [cloud services](https://microtime.com/cloud-computing/) are helping to
            bridge this gap, the costs and complexity of quantum computing remain
            barriers to widespread adoption.


            ## What Lies Ahead for QC


            As we look to the future, the road ahead for quantum computing is both
            challenging and full of potential. Here are some key developments to watch
            for in the coming years:


            **1\. Quantum-Classical Hybrid Systems**


            One of the most promising directions for QC is the development of quantum-classical
            hybrid systems. These systems combine the strengths of classical computing
            with the unique capabilities of quantum processors, allowing for more
            efficient problem-solving. In the near term, we are likely to see more
            hybrid approaches that leverage quantum computing for specific tasks while
            relying on classical computing for others.


            **2\. Quantum Networking and the Quantum Internet**


            Quantum networking, which involves connecting quantum computers over long
            distances, is an emerging field with the potential to revolutionize communication
            and data sharing. The concept of a quantum internet, where quantum information
            is transmitted securely over vast distances, is still in its early stages
            but could become a reality within the next decade. This would open up
            new possibilities for secure communication, distributed quantum computing,
            and more.


            **3\. Wider Industry Adoption**


            As quantum computing technology matures and becomes more accessible, we
            can expect to see broader adoption across various industries. Sectors
            such as finance, healthcare, energy, and logistics are likely to be early
            adopters, using QC to optimize processes, develop new materials, and solve
            complex logistical challenges. The potential applications are vast, and
            as businesses begin to see tangible benefits from QC, its adoption will
            accelerate.


            **4\. Ongoing Research and Development**


            The future of QC will be shaped by ongoing research and development efforts.
            Governments, academic institutions, and private companies are investing
            heavily in quantum research, with the goal of overcoming current challenges
            and unlocking the full potential of this technology. As breakthroughs
            continue to occur, we will move closer to the realization of quantum computing’s
            promise.


            As we look ahead, the continued advancement of quantum computing will
            depend on the collaboration between researchers, engineers, and businesses.
            The journey to fully functional QC is still in its early stages, but the
            progress made in 2024 demonstrates that the quantum revolution is well
            underway. By staying informed and engaged with the [developments](https://www.localitcompanies.com/boston-ma/)
            in this field, businesses and individuals alike can prepare for the transformative
            impact that quantum computing is set to have on the world.'

            As quantum computing develops, scientists are working to identify tasks
            for which quantum computers have a clear advantage over classical computers.
            So far, researchers have only pinpointed a handful of these problems,
            but ...


            ## Quantum computer


            A **quantum computer** is a device for computation that makes direct use
            of quantum mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement,
            to perform operations on data. The basic principle behind quantum computation
            is that quantum properties can be used to represent data and perform operations
            on these data.


            Although quantum computing is still in its infancy, experiments have been
            carried out in which quantum computational operations were executed on
            a very small number of qubits ( **qu** antum **bi** nary digi **ts**).
            Both practical and theoretical research continues with interest, and many
            national government and military funding agencies support quantum computing
            research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and national security
            purposes, such as cryptanalysis.


            If large-scale quantum computers can be built, they will be able to solve
            certain problems much faster than any of our current classical computers
            (for example Shor''s algorithm). Quantum computers are different from
            other computers such as DNA computers and traditional computers based
            on transistors. Some computing architectures such as optical computers
            may use classical superposition of electromagnetic waves. Without some
            specifically quantum mechanical resources such as entanglement, it is
            conjectured that an exponential advantage over classical computers is
            not possible.

          url: https://techxplore.com/news/2024-12-google-quantum-chip-breakthrough.html
          published_date: N/A
          text: 'Google says the Willow chip has it confidently on a path to the kind
            of quantum computing that could tackle seemingly insurmountable real-world
            problems.


            Google on Monday showed off a new quantum computing chip that it said
            was a major breakthrough that could bring practical quantum computing
            closer to reality.


            A custom chip called "Willow" does in minutes what it would take leading
            supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete, according to Google Quantum
            AI founder Hartmut Neven.


            "Written out, there is a 1 with 25 zeros," Neven said of the time span
            while briefing journalists. "A mind-boggling number."


            Neven''s team of about 300 people at Google is on a mission to build quantum
            computing capable of handling otherwise unsolvable problems like safe
            fusion power and stopping climate change.


            "We see Willow as an important step in our journey to build a useful quantum
            computer with practical applications in areas like drug discovery, fusion
            energy, battery design and more," said Google CEO Sundar Pichai on X.


            A quantum computer that can tackle these challenges is still years away,
            but Willow marks a significant step in that direction, according to Neven
            and members of his team.


            While still in its early stages, scientists believe that superfast quantum
            computing will eventually be able to power innovation in a range of fields.


            Quantum research is seen as a critical field and both the United States
            and China have been investing heavily in the area, while Washington has
            also placed restrictions on the export of the sensitive technology.


            Olivier Ezratty, an independent expert in quantum technologies, told AFP
            in October that private and public investment in the field has totaled
            around $20 billion worldwide over the past five years.


            Regular computers function in binary fashion: they carry out tasks using
            tiny fragments of data known as bits that are only ever either expressed
            as 1 or 0.


            But fragments of data on a quantum computer, known as qubits, can be both
            1 and 0 at the same time—allowing them to crunch an enormous number of
            potential outcomes simultaneously.


            Crucially, Google''s chip demonstrated the ability to reduce computational
            errors exponentially as it scales up—a feat that has eluded researchers
            for nearly 30 years.


            The breakthrough in error correction, published in leading science journal
            _Nature_, showed that adding more qubits to the system actually reduced
            errors rather than increasing them—a fundamental requirement for building
            practical quantum computers.


            Error correction is the "end game" in quantum computing and Google is
            "confidently progressing" along the path, according to Google director
            of quantum hardware Julian Kelly.

            up using _more_ qubits. This cracks a key challenge in quantum error correction
            that the field has pursued for almost 30 years.

            - Second, Willow performed a standard benchmark computation in under five
            minutes that would take one of today’s [fastest supercomputers](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/)
            10 septillion (that is, 1025) years — a number that vastly exceeds the
            age of the Universe.


            The Willow chip is a major step on a journey that began over 10 years
            ago. When I founded Google Quantum AI in 2012, the vision was to build
            a useful, large-scale quantum computer that could harness quantum mechanics
            — the “operating system” of nature to the extent we know it today — to
            benefit society by advancing scientific discovery, developing [helpful
            applications](https://quantumai.google/applications), and tackling some
            of society''s greatest challenges. As part of Google Research, our team
            has charted a long-term [roadmap](https://quantumai.google/roadmap), and
            Willow moves us significantly along that path towards commercially relevant
            applications.


            ## Exponential quantum error correction — below threshold!


            Errors are one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing, since
            qubits, the units of computation in quantum computers, have a tendency
            to rapidly exchange information with their environment, making it difficult
            to protect the information needed to complete a computation. Typically
            the more qubits you use, the more errors will occur, and the system becomes
            classical.


            Today in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y),
            we published results showing that [**the more qubits we use in Willow,
            the more we** **_reduce_** **errors**](https://research.google/blog/making-quantum-error-correction-work/)
            **, and the more quantum the system becomes**. We tested ever-larger arrays
            of physical qubits, scaling up from a grid of 3x3 encoded qubits, to a
            grid of 5x5, to a grid of 7x7 — and each time, using our latest advances
            in quantum error correction, we were able to cut the error rate in half.
            In other words, we achieved an exponential reduction in the error rate.
            This historic accomplishment is known in the field as “below threshold”
            — being able to drive errors down while scaling up the number of qubits.
            You must demonstrate being below threshold to show real progress on error
            correction, and this has been an outstanding challenge since [quantum
            error correction](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493)
            was introduced by Peter Shor in 1995.


            There are other scientific “firsts” involved in this result as well. For
            example, it’s also one of the first compelling examples of real-time error
            correction on a superconducting quantum system — crucial for any useful
            computation, because if you can’t correct errors fast enough, they ruin
            your computation before it’s done. And it’s a "beyond breakeven" demonstration,
            where our arrays of qubits have longer lifetimes than the individual physical
            qubits do, an unfakable sign that error correction is improving the system
            overall.


            As the first system below threshold, this is the most convincing prototype
            for a scalable logical qubit built to date. It’s a strong sign that useful,
            very large quantum computers can indeed be built. Willow brings us closer
            to running practical, commercially-relevant algorithms that can’t be replicated
            on conventional computers.


            ## 10 septillion years on one of today’s fastest supercomputers


            As a measure of Willow’s performance, we used the [random circuit sampling
            (RCS) benchmark](https://research.google/blog/validating-random-circuit-sampling-as-a-benchmark-for-measuring-quantum-progress/).
            Pioneered by our team and now widely used as a standard in the field,
            RCS is the classically hardest benchmark that can be done on a quantum
            computer today. You can think of this as an entry point for quantum computing
            — it checks whether a quantum computer is doing something that couldn’t
            be done on a classical computer. Any team building a quantum computer
            should check first if it can beat classical computers on RCS; otherwise
            there is strong reason for skepticism that it can tackle more complex
            quantum tasks. We’ve consistently used this benchmark to assess progress
            from one generation of chip to the next — we reported Sycamore results
            in [October 2019](https://blog.google/technology/ai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means/)
            and again recently in [October 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07998-6).


            Willow’s performance on this benchmark is astonishing: It performed a
            computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s [fastest
            supercomputers](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/) 1025 or 10 septillion
            years. If you want to write it out, it’s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
            years. This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics and
            vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion
            that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with
            the idea that we live in a multiverse, a [prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabric_of_Reality)
            first made by David Deutsch.


            These latest results for Willow, as shown in the plot below, are our best
            so far, but we’ll continue to make progress.


            Our assessment of how Willow outpaces one of the world’s most powerful
            classical supercomputers, [Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/),
            was based on conservative assumptions. For example, we assumed full access
            to secondary storage, i.e., hard drives, without any bandwidth overhead
            — a generous and unrealistic allowance for Frontier. Of course, as happened
            after we announced the first [beyond-classical computation in 2019](https://blog.google/technology/ai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means/),
            we expect classical computers to keep improving on this benchmark, but
            the rapidly growing gap shows that quantum processors are peeling away
            at a double exponential rate and will continue to vastly outperform classical
            computers as we scale up.


            ## State-of-the-art performance


            Willow was fabricated in our new, state-of-the-art fabrication facility
            in Santa Barbara — one of only a few facilities in the world built from
            the ground up for this purpose. System engineering is key when designing
            and fabricating quantum chips: All components of a chip, such as single
            and two-qubit gates, qubit reset, and readout, have to be simultaneously
            well engineered and integrated. If any component lags or if two components
            don''t function well together, it drags down system performance. Therefore,
            maximizing system performance informs all aspects of our process, from
            chip architecture and fabrication to gate development and calibration.
            The achievements we report assess quantum computing systems holistically,
            not just one factor at a time.


            We’re focusing on quality, not just quantity — because just producing
            larger numbers of qubits doesn’t help if they’re not high enough quality.
            With 105 qubits, Willow now has best-in-class performance across the two
            system benchmarks discussed above: quantum error correction and random
            circuit sampling. Such algorithmic benchmarks are the best way to measure
            overall chip performance. Other more specific performance metrics are
            also important; for example, our T1 times, which measure how long qubits
            can retain an excitation — the key quantum computational resource — are
            now approaching 100 µs (microseconds). This is an impressive ~5x improvement
            over our previous generation of chips. If you want to evaluate quantum
            hardware and compare across platforms, here is a table of key specifications:


            ## What’s next with Willow and beyond


            The next challenge for the field is to demonstrate a first "useful, beyond-classical"
            computation on today''s quantum chips that is relevant to a real-world
            application. We’re optimistic that the Willow generation of chips can
            help us achieve this goal. So far, there have been two separate types
            of experiments. On the one hand, we’ve run the RCS benchmark, which measures
            performance against classical computers but has no known real-world applications.
            On the other hand, we’ve done scientifically interesting simulations of
            quantum systems, which have led to new scientific discoveries but are
            still within the reach of classical computers. Our goal is to do both
            at the same time — to step into the realm of algorithms that are beyond
            the reach of classical computers **and** that are useful for real-world,
            commercially relevant problems.


            We invite researchers, engineers, and developers to join us on this journey
            by checking out our [open source software](https://quantumai.google/software)
            and educational resources, including our [new course on Coursera](https://coursera.org/learn/quantum-error-correction),
            where developers can learn the essentials of quantum error correction
            and help us create algorithms that can solve the problems of the future.


            My colleagues sometimes ask me why I left the burgeoning field of AI to
            focus on quantum computing. My answer is that both will prove to be the
            most transformational technologies of our time, but advanced AI will significantly
            benefit from access to quantum computing. This is why I named our lab
            Quantum AI. Quantum algorithms have fundamental scaling laws on their
            side, as we’re seeing with RCS. There are similar scaling advantages for
            many foundational computational tasks that are essential for AI. So quantum
            computation will be indispensable for collecting training data that’s
            inaccessible to classical machines, training and optimizing certain learning
            architectures, and modeling systems where quantum effects are important.
            This includes helping us discover new medicines, designing more efficient
            batteries for electric cars, and accelerating progress in fusion and new
            energy alternatives. Many of these future game-changing applications won’t
            be feasible on classical computers; they’re waiting to be unlocked with
            quantum computing.'

          text: 'Google has made a quantum computer chip that can solve a problem
            that would be impossible for the world’s most powerful traditional computers
            in just five minutes.


            The international tech giant is putting billions of dollars into [quantum
            computing](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/01/09/oxford-start-up-wins-backing-race-make-britain-quantum-computing/),
            which experts believe will be able to herald advances in medicine, electrical
            vehicles and [green energy](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/renewable-energy/).


            Quantum computers are also expected to be able to crack modern encryption
            and could power an [unhackable internet](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2024/10/27/nhs-turns-quantum-computers-manage-doctors-rota/),
            but [Google](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/0/google-rules-life-monopoly-antitrust-degoogle-android/)
            says this application is about a decade away from being possible.


            Google’s latest foray into quantum computers is a computer chip called
            Willow, which is about an inch long. Studies found it was able to solve
            a specific problem in five minutes that the most powerful conventional
            computers would take 10 septillion years to manage.


            Ten septillion years is a timescale that is longer than the [universe](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/tv/0/universe-review-bizarre-mash-up-natural-history-space-science/)
            is old, and the findings demonstrate for the first time that quantum computers
            are able to complete tasks beyond classical computers.


            The task it solved, the [random circuit sampling](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/business/2023/07/02/google-quantum-computer-breakthrough-instant-calculations/)
            (RCS) benchmark, is a statistical process that tasks a computer with calculating
            randomness into measurements.


            “RCS is the classically hardest benchmark that can be done on a quantum
            computer today,” Hartmut Neven, founder of Google Quantum AI, said.


            “You can think of this as an entry point for quantum computing – it checks
            whether a quantum computer is doing something that couldn’t be done on
            a classical computer.”


            Quantum computing is fundamentally different, and more powerful, to normal
            computers because it uses quantum bits (qubits) instead of normal bits
            to process information.


            Instead of being constrained to the one and zero language of binary coding,
            qubits can exist in multiple states – a phenomenon known as superposition,
            which ramps up computing power exponentially.


            ## Extremely fragile


            Qubits are made from tiny particles, such as the electrons of phosphorus
            atoms, which have “spin” and point magnetic north or south (the equivalent
            of zero and one), but also multiple directions in between, like a compass
            needle.


            While pointless for tasks such as running word processors or web streaming,
            they could help [break encryptions](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2020/01/22/googles-sundar-pichai-quantum-computing-could-end-encryption/)
            or simulate hugely complex biological processes.


            However, qubits are extremely fragile and often prone to losing their
            information, with computations often collapsing once an error is made.


            Google has reported in a new paper, published on Monday in the journal
            Nature, that it has cracked this 20-year-long technical issue with a built-in
            guardrail that suppresses errors to a level low enough for the machine
            to be viable.


            Mr Neven told reporters that quantum computers will “tackle issues that
            normal computers and AI can not”.


            [Artificial intelligence](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/artificial-intelligence/),
            he says, is particularly adept at problems in the quantum world where
            Newtonian physics gives way to the laws of the quantum realm.


            As a result, issues such as [nuclear fusion](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/nuclear-fusion/),
            subatomic interactions between drugs and the body, and developing new
            batteries are where quantum computers could see the most progress.


            Charina Chou, chief operating officer at Google Quantum AI, said: “These
            have been really excellent breakthroughs from the team, but they are steps
            along our journey to a quantum computer for otherwise unsolvable problems,
            and I want to emphasise this.


            “While this is an amazing project – it’s very fun, it’s a lot of cool
            science and engineering – the ultimate goal of our computer is to help
            to get to these otherwise unsolvable problems.”


            Mr Neven adds that the progress made by Willow shows it is “the most convincing
            prototype” built to date.


            “It’s a strong sign that useful, very large quantum computers can indeed
            be built,” he said.


            “Willow brings us closer to running practical, commercially relevant [algorithms](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/north-america/united-states/new-york/what-really-happened-when-let-tiktoks-algorithms-plan-holiday/)
            that can’t be replicated on conventional computers.”


            ## ‘Transformational technologies’


            Google now plans to use Willow to demonstrate a first “useful, beyond-classical”
            computation that is actually relevant to the real world, and not an abstract
            conundrum.


            “We’re optimistic that the Willow generation of chips can help us achieve
            this goal,” Mr Neven added.


            “Our goal is to step into the realm of algorithms that are beyond the
            reach of classical computers and that are useful for real-world, commercially
            relevant problems.”


            “Both AI and quantum will prove to be the most transformational technologies
            of our time, but advanced AI will significantly benefit from access to
            quantum computing.”


            He believes that the success of Willow “lends credence to the notion that
            quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes” and fits the theory
            that we exist inside a [multiverse](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/books/what-to-read/do-finally-have-proof-multiverse/).'

          published_date: N/A
          text: 'Google’s quantum computing lab just achieved a major milestone. On
            Monday, [the company revealed](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/)
            that its new quantum computing chip, Willow, is capable of performing
            a computing challenge in less than five minutes — a process Google says
            would take one of the world’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years,
            or longer than the age of the universe.


            That’s a big jump from 2019 when Google announced its [quantum processor
            could complete](https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/23/20928294/google-quantum-supremacy-sycamore-computer-qubit-milestone)
            a mathematical equation in three minutes, as opposed to 10,000 years on
            a supercomputer. IBM [disputed the claim](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/google-quantum-computing-quantum-supremacy-claim-by-google-disputed-by-ibm/)
            at the time.


            Along with more powerful performance, researchers also found a way to
            reduce errors, something Google calls “one of the greatest challenges
            in quantum computing.” Instead of bits, which represent either 1 or 0,
            quantum computing uses qubits, [a unit that can exist in multiple states](https://www.ibm.com/topics/qubit#:~:text=A%20classical%20bit%20can%20only%20exist%20in%20either%20a%200%20position%20or%20a%201%20position.%20Qubits%2C%20however%2C%20can%20also%20occupy%20a%20third%20state%20known%20as%20a%20superposition.%20A%20superposition%20represents%200%2C%201%2C%20and%20all%20the%20positions%20in%20between%20taken%20at%20once%2C%20for%20a%20total%20of%20three%20separate%20positions.)
            at the same time, such as 1, 0, and anything in between.


            As noted by Google, qubits are prone to errors because they “have a tendency
            to rapidly exchange information with their environment.” However, Google’s
            researchers discovered a way to reduce errors by introducing more qubits
            to a system and were able to correct them in real time. Their findings
            were [published in _Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y).


            “This historic accomplishment is known in the field as ‘below threshold’
            — being able to drive errors down while scaling up the number of qubits,”
            Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven writes on Google’s blog. “You
            must demonstrate being below threshold to show real progress on error
            correction, and this has been an outstanding challenge since [quantum
            error correction](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493)
            was introduced by Peter Shor in 1995.”


            Willow, which has 105 qubits, “now has best-in-class performance,” according
            to Neven. [Microsoft](https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24120103/microsoft-says-its-cracked-the-code-on-an-important-quantum-computing-problem),
            [Amazon](https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158365/quantum-computing-network-aws-amazon-harvard),
            and [IBM](https://www.theverge.com/23988271/ibm-quantum-heron-system-two-jerry-chow-qubits)
            are working on quantum computing systems of their own.


            Google’s next goal is to perform a first “useful, beyond-classical” computation
            that is both “relevant to a real-world application” and one that typical
            computers can’t achieve. Going forward, Neven says quantum technology
            will be “indispensable” for collecting AI training data, eventually helping
            to “discover new medicines, designing more efficient batteries for electric
            cars, and accelerating progress in fusion and new energy alternatives.”'

            could see the excitement building around quantum computing–a technology
            that represents a fundamental shift in how we process information, applying
            quantum physics to solve problems far beyond the reach of even the most
            powerful classical computers.


            Among numerous other developments, in March 2024, Quantinuum announced
            [a breakthrough](https://www.quantinuum.com/press-releases/quantinuum-proves-their-quantum-computers-will-scale-with-major-hardware-innovation)
            in the ability to build a large-scale quantum computer. A month later,
            at the [Quantum World Congress,](https://www.networkworld.com/article/3523669/ibm-microsoft-and-boeing-mark-advances-in-quantum-computing.html)
            IBM, Microsoft, and Boeing all announced major developments in their quantum
            research. Capping off the year, in December, Google unveiled its [Willow
            processor](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/),
            hailed as a significant achievement in the journey toward practical quantum
            computing. Mainstream enthusiasm was accelerating.


            Then came January, and the annual Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas,
            where Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang [said](https://fortune.com/2025/01/09/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-tanks-quantum-computing-stocks/)
            on stage, in a room full of reporters, that he didn’t anticipate “very
            useful” quantum computing for another 15 to 30 years. Three months later,
            in front of a gathering of quantum leaders, he issued [a course correction](https://www.wsj.com/articles/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-apologizes-for-his-quantum-effect-d0fef4d8?msockid=141f3282e0e2671b297421b7e1ad6677),
            but there was no doubt his commentary continued to spark deliberation
            across the industry and investors about where we are in the innovation
            trajectory for quantum computing and where we are going next.


            While many people still believe we are three to five years out from true
            commercial viability for quantum computing, as participants in the process,
            we respectfully disagree. The quantum era is not 15 to 30 years away.
            It is not three to five. The truth is the quantum era has already begun.


            ## There won’t be a light bulb moment


            Perhaps this misalignment stems from how we’ve come to expect technology
            to arrive—with a big product reveal. For personal computing, it was the
            Apple II in 1977: the first truly consumer-ready PC. For the commercial
            internet, it was Netscape Navigator in 1994, which brought the web to
            millions of desktops and lit the fuse for a digital revolution. But quantum
            computing is not like these previous technological light bulb moments.
            Quantum computing’s evolution is less visible and more distributed.


            You will not see a quantum computer for sale at Best Buy or a revolutionary
            app. The transformation will happen behind the scenes, embedded in the
            foundational systems of science, logistics, healthcare, and finance. Instead
            of a launch moment it will come with performance breakthroughs, solved
            problems, and enduring value creation.


            Unless you are in the trenches working on quantum computers each day,
            it is hard to realize how far we have come. However, a look behind the
            scenes reveals this technology is now on the tipping point of delivering
            widespread industrial usefulness as commercial users have opened their
            eyes to its true value potential.


            For instance, global pharmaceutical companies are advancing both disease
            research and the frontier of quantum-enabled drug discovery. And in automotive
            and aerospace, companies are using quantum computing to improve the performance
            of hydrogen fuel cell catalysts and electric batteries mobility. Companies
            like ours are currently using quantum hardware to generate truly random
            encryption keys—making systems more secure against today’s threats and
            tomorrow’s quantum-enabled ones.


            These use cases are no longer just theoretical, they are real-world, commercially
            viable, value-creating initiatives. In aerospace, energy, financial services,
            and national security, quantum use cases are being developed not as moonshots,
            but as competitive tools. And in some cases, they are already outpacing
            traditional approaches.


            If you define the start of the commercial era for a product as the moment
            that value creation has begun, that start date is already in the rearview
            mirror. The three examples above and countless others brought forward
            by this nascent industry are all creating value for commercial entities.


            Both quantum software and hardware have been advancing at breakneck speed
            over the last 18 months—a pace that mirrors the early days of classical
            computing. Not long ago, many imagined that 100 qubit quantum computers
            were achievable within a decade. But earlier this year, Microsoft unveiled
            the world’s first quantum processor powered by topological qubits.


            Governments around the world are taking notice and funding these efforts.
            According to the [Center for Strategic & International Studies](https://www.csis.org/blogs/perspectives-innovation/quick-take-quantum-technology-global-competition),
            China, Germany, the United Kingdom, the United States, and South Korea
            lead the world in public investments in quantum technology, but numerous
            other nations are funding initiatives as well, driving innovation and
            tangible results. Universities are [launching](https://engineering.yale.edu/news-and-events/news/yale-launch-certificate-quantum-science-and-engineering-fall-2025)
            quantum engineering programs, venture capital has begun to flow into the
            sector, workers are shifting toward the quantum space, and the commercial
            quantum computing ecosystem is rapidly taking shape.


            In other words, despite those who say this technology’s time is not yet
            now, the fact is the quantum train is leaving the station. For developers,
            investors, and policymakers, hesitation to invest, test and adopt new
            technologies opens the door for competitors and adversaries to move ahead.
            Early adopters of quantum computing are already filing patents, building
            infrastructure, developing software platforms, and shaping standards.
            Sitting on the sidelines means giving up first-mover advantage in one
            of the most powerful technological breakthroughs of this century.


            Quantum computing is not just a tool—it is a national capability. Countries
            that lead will attract the talent, secure the data, and define how this
            new technology is regulated, protected, and deployed. Those that lag in
            investing in quantum computing may find themselves playing catch-up in
            cybersecurity, energy modeling, drug development, and defense applications.
            This is not hypothetical, nor is it about a light bulb moment. It is happening
            now, and it has been [ramping up over the past decade](https://time.com/magazine/us/4789/february-17th-2014-vol-183-no-6-u-s/).


            The quantum computing leaders of tomorrow are building, and commercializing,
            today. Others may continue to debate but the opportunity belongs to those
            who treat quantum as a strategy versus an eventuality. If you are running
            a business, building a research agenda, managing a portfolio, or setting
            national policy, now is the time to engage.'

            Quantum error correction that suppresses errors below a critical threshold
            needed for achieving future practical quantum computing applications is
            demonstrated on the newest generation quantum chips from Google Quantum
            AI, reports a [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y)
            in _Nature_ this week. The device performance, if scaled, could facilitate
            the operational requirements of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing.


            Quantum computing has the potential to speed up computing and exceed the
            capabilities of classical computers at certain tasks. However, quantum
            computers are prone to errors, making current prototypes unable to run
            long enough to achieve practical outputs.


            The strategy devised by [quantum computing](https://phys.org/tags/quantum+computing/)
            researchers to address this relies on quantum error correction, where
            information is spread over many qubits (units of quantum information,
            similar to classical computer bits) allowing the identification and compensation
            of errors without damaging the computation. The overhead in [qubits](https://phys.org/tags/qubits/)
            required by quantum error correction potentially introduces more errors
            than it corrects.


            As a result, achieving "below threshold" operations has proven challenging,
            where the uncorrected error rate is below a critical value that is required
            for error correction to work as intended and exponentially suppress errors.


            Hartmut Neven and colleagues present the newest generation of a superconducting
            quantum processing chip architecture, called Willow, which is capable
            of [quantum error correction](https://phys.org/tags/quantum+error+correction/)
            below the critical threshold for a particular quantum error correcting
            approach, known as surface code. Their system is operated for up to 1
            million cycles over several hours while decoding errors in real time and
            maintaining its performance.


            The authors execute surface codes on a 72-qubit processor and a 105-qubit
            processor. Each time the code distance is increased from 3 to 5 to 7,
            the logical error rate is halved. This exponential suppression of logical
            errors forms the foundation for running large scale quantum algorithms
            with error correction, the authors conclude.

            the best classical computers.**


            _By squeezing extra performance from hardware with shorter circuits, transpilation,
            dynamical decoupling, and error-mitigation, the team finally crossed a
            milestone long called the “holy grail” of quantum computing._


            #### Quantum Exponential Speedup Breakthrough


            Quantum computers have long promised to revolutionize technology, with
            the ability to speed up complex calculations, design new medicines, break
            modern encryption, and uncover exotic new materials. But there’s been
            a major obstacle: noise. That’s the term for all the tiny errors that
            build up during quantum computations, often making these futuristic machines
            less effective than even today’s classical computers.


            Until now.


            A breakthrough led by Daniel Lidar, a professor of engineering at USC
            and an expert in quantum error correction, has pushed quantum computing
            past a key milestone. Working with researchers from USC and Johns Hopkins,
            Lidar’s team demonstrated a powerful exponential speedup using two of
            IBM’s 127-qubit Eagle quantum processors — all operated remotely through
            the cloud. Their results were published in the prestigious journal _Physical
            Review X_.


            “There have previously been demonstrations of more modest types of speedups
            like a polynomial speedup, says Lidar, who is also the cofounder of Quantum
            Elements, Inc. “But an exponential speedup is the most dramatic type of
            speed up that we expect to see from quantum computers.”

            #### What ‘Unconditional’ Exponential Advantage Means


            The key milestone for quantum computing, Lidar says, has always been to
            demonstrate that we can execute entire algorithms with a scaling speedup
            relative to ordinary “classical” computers.


            He clarifies that a scaling speedup doesn’t mean that you can do things,
            say, 100 times faster. “Rather, it’s that as you increase a problem’s
            size by including more variables, the gap between the quantum and the
            classical performance keeps growing. And an exponential speedup means
            that the performance gap roughly doubles for every additional variable.
            Moreover, the speedup we demonstrated is unconditional.”


            What makes a speedup “unconditional,” Lidar explains, is that it doesn’t
            rely on any unproven assumptions. Prior speedup claims required the assumption
            that there is no better classical algorithm against which to benchmark
            the quantum algorithm. Here, the team led by Lidar used an algorithm they
            modified for the quantum computer to solve a variation of “Simon’s problem,”
            an early example of quantum algorithms that can, in theory, solve a task
            exponentially faster than any classical counterpart, unconditionally.


            #### Simon’s Problem: Proving Quantum Supremacy


            Simon’s problem involves finding a hidden repeating pattern in a mathematical
            function and is considered the precursor to what’s known as Shor’s factoring
            algorithm, which can be used to break codes and launched the entire field
            of quantum computing. Simon’s problem is like a guessing game, where the
            players try to guess a secret number known only to the game host (the
            “oracle”). Once a player guesses two numbers for which the answers returned
            by the oracle are identical, the secret number is revealed, and that player
            wins. Quantum players can win this game exponentially faster than classical
            players.


            So, how did the team achieve their exponential speedup? Phattharaporn
            Singkanipa, USC doctoral researcher and first author, says, “The key was
            squeezing every ounce of performance from the hardware: shorter circuits,
            smarter pulse sequences, and statistical error mitigation.”


            #### Four Tricks to Tame Quantum Noise


            The researchers achieved this in four different ways:


            First, they limited the data input by restricting how many secret numbers
            would be allowed (technically, by limiting the number of 1’s in the binary
            representation of the set of secret numbers). This resulted in fewer quantum
            logic operations than would be needed otherwise, which reduced the opportunity
            for error buildup.


            Second, they compressed the number of required quantum logic operations
            as much as possible using a method known as transpilation.


            Third, and most crucially, the researchers applied a method called “dynamical
            decoupling,” which means applying sequences of carefully designed pulses
            to detach the behavior of qubits within the quantum computer from their
            noisy environment and keep the quantum processing on track. Dynamical
            decoupling had the most dramatic impact on their ability to demonstrate
            a quantum speedup.


            Finally, they applied “measurement error mitigation,” a method that finds
            and corrects certain errors that are left over after dynamical decoupling
            due to imperfections in measuring the qubits’ state at the end of the
            algorithm.


            #### Evidence Quantum Edge Is Here


            Says Lidar, who is also a professor of Chemistry and Physics at the USC
            Dornsife College of Letters, Arts and Science, “The quantum computing
            community is showing how quantum processors are beginning to outperform
            their classical counterparts in targeted tasks, and are stepping into
            a territory classical computing simply can’t reach., Our result shows
            that already today’s quantum computers firmly lie on the side of a scaling
            quantum advantage.”


            He adds that with this new research, The performance separation cannot
            be reversed because the exponential speedup we’ve demonstrated is, for
            the first time, unconditional.” In other words, the quantum performance
            advantage is becoming increasingly difficult to dispute.


            #### Looking Ahead: From Milestone to Practical Impact


            Lidar cautions that “this result doesn’t have practical applications beyond
            winning guessing games, and much more work remains to be done before quantum
            computers can be claimed to have solved a practical real-world problem.”


            This will require demonstrating speedups that don’t rely on “oracles”
            that know the answer in advance and making significant advances in methods
            for further reducing noise and decoherence in ever larger quantum computers.
            Nevertheless, quantum computers’ previously “on-paper promise” to provide
            exponential speedups has now been firmly demonstrated.

            Researchers at Google Quantum AI and collaborators have developed a quantum
            processor with error rates that get progressively smaller as the number
            of quantum bits (qubits) grows larger. This achievement is a milestone
            for quantum error correction, as it could, in principle, lead to an unlimited
            increase in qubit quality, and ultimately to an unlimited increase in
            the length and complexity of the algorithms that quantum computers can
            run.


            Noise is an inherent feature of all physical systems, including computers.
            The bits in classical computers are protected from this noise by redundancy:
            some of the data is held in more than one place, so if an error occurs,
            it is easily identified and remedied. However, the no-cloning theorem
            of quantum mechanics dictates that once a quantum state is measured –
            a first step towards copying it – it is destroyed. “For a little bit,
            people were surprised that quantum error correction could exist at all,”
            observes [Michael Newman](https://mgnewman727.wixsite.com/michaelnewman),
            a staff research scientist at Google Quantum AI.


            Beginning in the mid-1990s, however, information theorists showed that
            this barrier is not insurmountable, and several codes for correcting qubit
            errors were developed. The principle underlying all of them is that multiple
            physical qubits (such as individual atomic energy levels or states in
            superconducting circuits) can be networked to create a single logical
            qubit that collectively holds the quantum information. It is then possible
            to use “measure” qubits to determine whether an error occurred on one
            of the “data” qubits without affecting the state of the latter.


            “In quantum error correction, we basically track the state,” Newman explains.
            “We say ‘Okay, what errors are happening?’ We figure that out on the fly,
            and then when we do a measurement of the logical information – which gives
            us our answer – we can reinterpret our measurement according to our understanding
            of what errors have happened.”


            ### Keeping error rates low


            In principle, this procedure makes it possible for infinitely stable qubits
            to perform indefinitely long calculations – but only if error rates remain
            low enough. The problem is that each additional physical qubit introduces
            a fresh source of error. Increasing the number of physical qubits in each
            logical qubit is therefore a double-edged sword, and the logical qubit’s
            continued stability depends on several factors. These include the ability
            of the quantum processor’s (classical) software to detect and interpret
            errors; the specific error-correction code used; and, importantly, the
            fidelity of the physical qubits themselves.


            In 2023, Newman and colleagues at Google Quantum AI showed that an error-correction
            code called the surface code (which Newman describes as having “one of
            the highest error-suppression factors of any quantum code”) [made it just
            about possible](https://physicsworld.com/a/breakthrough-in-quantum-error-correction-could-lead-to-large-scale-quantum-computers/)
            to “win” at error correction by adding more physical qubits to the system.
            Specifically, they showed that a distance-5 array logical qubit made from
            49 superconducting transmon qubits had a slightly lower error rate than
            a distance-3 array qubit made from 17 such qubits. But the margin was
            slim. “We knew that…this wouldn’t persist,” Newman says.


            ### “Convincing, exponential error suppression”


            In the latest work, which is published in [_Nature_](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y)
            _,_ a Google Quantum AI team led by [Hartmut Neven](https://research.google/people/hartmutneven/)
            unveil a new superconducting processor called Willow with several improvements
            over the previous Sycamore chip. These include gates (the building blocks
            of logical operations) that retain their “quantumness” five times longer
            and a Google Deepmind-developed machine learning algorithm that interprets
            errors in real time. When the team used this new tech to create nine surface
            code distance-3 arrays, four distance-5 arrays and one 101-qubit distance-7
            array on their 105-qubit processor, the error rate was suppressed by a
            factor of 2.4 as additional qubits were added.


            How it works: Surface code logical qubits for processors of increasing
            size. Each larger processor can correct more errors than its predecessor.
            The encoded quantum state is stored on the array of data qubits (gold).

            data qubits. (Courtesy: Google Quantum AI)


            “This is the first time we have seen convincing, exponential error suppression
            in the logical qubits as we increase the number of physical qubits,” says
            Newman. “That’s something people have been trying to do for about 30 years.”


            With gates that remain stable for hours on end, quantum computers should
            be able to run the large, complex algorithms people have always hoped
            for. “We still have a long way to go, we still need to do this at scale,”
            Newman acknowledges. “But the first time we pushed the button on this
            Willow chip and I saw the lattice getting larger and larger and the error
            rate going down and down, I thought ‘Wow! Quantum error correction is
            really going to work…Quantum computing is really going to work!’”

            a physicist at Harvard University in the US who also works on quantum
            error correction, calls the Google Quantum AI result “a very important

            – the fundamental principles of error correction have now been demonstrated. 
            It’s very exciting.”'

            computing](https://cloudblogs.microsoft.com/quantum/2024/04/03/how-microsoft-and-quantinuum-achieved-reliable-quantum-computing/),
            bringing quantum computing closer to a commercial state.


            The company worked in collaboration with quantum computing hardware maker
            Quantinuum to improve the performance of the qubit — the very basic unit
            of quantum computing. Qubits work by holding two different phases at once
            (instead of just a one and a zero, it’s both), but they aren’t very stable,
            making it easy for them to lose data. Researchers can now create several
            “logical qubits,” or qubits that are more stable while holding these different
            states.


            Krysta Svore, vice president of advanced quantum development at Microsoft,
            told _The Verge_ in an interview that because qubits are prone to errors,
            researchers needed to find a way to stabilize them.


            “We need reliable quantum computing, and not just in theory; we need to
            demonstrate that it can work in practice,” Svore says. “I like to think
            of it as putting noise-cancelling headphones on the qubits.”


            She says that these more reliable qubits help quantum computing “graduate”
            from level one, the more foundational level with qubits prone to mistakes
            and are usually referred to as noisy, to the next level, where scientists
            can run more calculations correctly and scale up the technology for more
            commercial use.


            Other quantum computing experts welcomed Microsoft and Quantinuum’s advancement.
            Henry Yuen, associate professor of computer science at Columbia and a
            theoretical computer scientist, tells _the Verge_ via email this may just
            be the beginning of more discoveries that make quantum computing easier.


            “We’re far from the final destination, but the signposts are getting more
            frequent and are indicating that some major milestones are coming up soon,”
            Yuen says. “I’m sure there will be bigger and better demonstrations of
            quantum fault tolerance coming soon.”


            Microsoft brought its qubit-virtualization system, which Svore says “abstracts”
            groups of physical qubits together, to Quantiuum’s quantum computer to
            create virtual logical qubits.


            With it, users could create qubits with a longer fault tolerance, or time
            without encountering an error. The team created four reliable logical
            qubits from only 30 physical qubits. Previously, the scientific consensus
            was that hundreds of physical qubits were needed to make a couple of logical
            qubits that didn’t fail, and they would have taken decades to create.


            The teams ran 14,000 calculations without losing the quantum state and
            found they improved the error rate by a factor of 800 over physical qubits.
            Svore says the system could detect and fix errors without destroying the
            logical qubit and keeping the string of calculations going.


            Microsoft is now figuring out how to bring this capability to Azure Quantum
            Elements, its platform for scientists to use AI, high-performance computing,
            and quantum computing to run scientific experiments.


            Yuen says that while he thinks the term “quantum virtualization” may be
            Microsoft’s branding for error-correcting code, its findings could be
            scalable for other quantum computing companies to try on their own.


            Quantum computing has always seemed like far into the future innovation,
            despite the idea and experimentation being around for decades. [Companies
            such as IBM](https://www.theverge.com/23988271/ibm-quantum-heron-system-two-jerry-chow-qubits),
            Microsoft, and [Google have been trying](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/19/22443453/google-quantum-computer-2029-decade-commercial-useful-qubits-quantum-transistor)
            to make quantum computing reliable, safe, cost-effective, and, more importantly,
            useful for years.


            Quantinuum chief product officer Ilyas Khan and senior director of offering
            management Jenni Strabley [said in a blog post](https://www.quantinuum.com/news/a-new-breakthrough-in-logical-quantum-computing-reveals-the-scale-of-our-industry-leadership)
            that they plan to continue improving the system to create more reliable
            logical qubits.


            “In the short term – with a hybrid supercomputer powered by a hundred
            reliable logical qubits, we believe that organizations will be able to
            start to see scientific advantages and will be able to accelerate valuable
            progress toward some of the most important problems that mankind faces
            such as modeling the materials used in batteries and hydrogen fuel cells
            or accelerating the development of meaning-aware AI language models,”
            Quantinuum said in its post.


            Now, with Microsoft and Quantiuum’s work, it’s up to others to see if
            they can replicate the same thing.'

          text: 'Quantum computing (QC), once a theoretical concept confined to academic
            research, has rapidly evolved into one of the most exciting and promising
            fields in technology. As we move through 2024, QC is inching closer to
            practical applications that could revolutionize industries from cryptography
            to drug discovery. However, alongside these breakthroughs come significant
            challenges that must be addressed before quantum computing can reach its
            full potential. Let’s explore the latest developments in quantum computing,
            the obstacles that remain, and what the future may hold for this transformative
            technology.


            ## Breakthroughs in Quantum Computing in 2024


            2024 has been a year of significant progress in the field of QC, with
            several key breakthroughs that are bringing us closer to realizing its
            potential:


            **1\. Increased Qubit Stability and Error Correction**


            One of the most critical challenges in quantum computing has always been
            maintaining the stability of qubits—the basic units of quantum information.
            In 2024, researchers have made notable advancements in error correction
            techniques, which are essential for stabilizing qubits and reducing the
            errors that occur during quantum computations. Improved error correction
            codes and the development of more stable qubits, such as topological qubits,
            have pushed the boundaries of what is possible, bringing us closer to
            achieving reliable quantum computing.


            **2\. Quantum Supremacy Milestones**


            Quantum supremacy—the point at which a quantum computer can solve a problem
            that classical computers cannot—has been a hot topic in recent years.
            In 2024, several QC firms and research institutions have announced new
            milestones in this area. While there is still debate over what constitutes
            true quantum supremacy, the latest demonstrations have shown quantum computers
            tackling increasingly complex problems, outpacing their classical counterparts
            in specific tasks such as complex simulations and optimization problems.


            **3\. Advancements in Quantum Algorithms**


            The development of quantum algorithms has seen significant progress in
            2024. New algorithms designed to take advantage of quantum computing’s
            unique capabilities are being developed, offering the potential to solve
            problems in fields such as cryptography, materials science, and machine
            learning more efficiently than ever before. For instance, advances in
            quantum algorithms for factoring large numbers have implications for breaking
            traditional encryption methods, a development that could reshape the field
            of [cybersecurity](https://microtime.com/cybersecurity-services/).


            **4\. Commercial Quantum [Cloud Services](https://microtime.com/cloud-computing/)**


            Quantum computing is gradually becoming more accessible, thanks to the
            expansion of quantum [cloud services](https://microtime.com/cloud-computing/)
            offered by tech giants such as IBM, Google, and Amazon. In 2024, these
            platforms have introduced more powerful quantum processors, allowing businesses
            and researchers to experiment with QC without needing to build and maintain
            their own quantum hardware. These services are making it easier for organizations
            to explore quantum computing applications in a real-world context, accelerating
            innovation across industries.


            ## Challenges Facing Quantum Computing


            Despite these exciting breakthroughs, significant challenges remain before
            quantum computing can be fully realized and integrated into everyday use:


            **1\. Scalability Issues**


            While qubit stability has improved, scaling quantum computers to the level
            necessary for solving large, complex problems remains a daunting challenge.
            Building quantum computers with millions of qubits that can operate reliably
            in tandem is still beyond our current capabilities. As researchers work
            to overcome these scalability issues, the goal of creating large-scale
            quantum computers remains on the horizon.


            **2\. Quantum Error Correction**


            Although error correction has improved, it is not yet at the level required
            for fully fault-tolerant QC. Quantum systems are inherently susceptible
            to noise and decoherence, which can introduce errors into computations.
            Developing more efficient and effective error correction methods is essential
            for the future of quantum computing, and remains an active area of research
            in 2024.


            **3\. Hardware Limitations**


            The physical construction of quantum computers presents significant engineering
            challenges. Quantum processors need to operate at extremely low temperatures,
            close to absolute zero, and are highly sensitive to environmental disturbances.
            Maintaining the delicate balance required for quantum operations is difficult,
            and building robust, reliable quantum hardware that can function outside
            of highly controlled laboratory environments is still a major hurdle.


            **4\. Security Concerns**


            The potential of QC to break current cryptographic systems is both a promise
            and a threat. As quantum computers become more powerful, they could render
            many of the encryption methods that secure today’s digital communications
            obsolete. This has led to a race to develop quantum-resistant cryptography,
            but widespread adoption is still years away. The looming threat of quantum-enabled
            cyberattacks is a significant concern for governments and industries worldwide.


            **5\. High Costs and Accessibility**


            Quantum computing technology remains expensive, and the expertise required
            to work with quantum systems is still relatively rare. This limits access
            to QC for many businesses and researchers, particularly smaller organizations
            without the resources to invest in cutting-edge technology. While quantum
            [cloud services](https://microtime.com/cloud-computing/) are helping to
            bridge this gap, the costs and complexity of quantum computing remain
            barriers to widespread adoption.


            ## What Lies Ahead for QC


            As we look to the future, the road ahead for quantum computing is both
            challenging and full of potential. Here are some key developments to watch
            for in the coming years:


            **1\. Quantum-Classical Hybrid Systems**


            One of the most promising directions for QC is the development of quantum-classical
            hybrid systems. These systems combine the strengths of classical computing
            with the unique capabilities of quantum processors, allowing for more
            efficient problem-solving. In the near term, we are likely to see more
            hybrid approaches that leverage quantum computing for specific tasks while
            relying on classical computing for others.


            **2\. Quantum Networking and the Quantum Internet**


            Quantum networking, which involves connecting quantum computers over long
            distances, is an emerging field with the potential to revolutionize communication
            and data sharing. The concept of a quantum internet, where quantum information
            is transmitted securely over vast distances, is still in its early stages
            but could become a reality within the next decade. This would open up
            new possibilities for secure communication, distributed quantum computing,
            and more.


            **3\. Wider Industry Adoption**


            As quantum computing technology matures and becomes more accessible, we
            can expect to see broader adoption across various industries. Sectors
            such as finance, healthcare, energy, and logistics are likely to be early
            adopters, using QC to optimize processes, develop new materials, and solve
            complex logistical challenges. The potential applications are vast, and
            as businesses begin to see tangible benefits from QC, its adoption will
            accelerate.


            **4\. Ongoing Research and Development**


            The future of QC will be shaped by ongoing research and development efforts.
            Governments, academic institutions, and private companies are investing
            heavily in quantum research, with the goal of overcoming current challenges
            and unlocking the full potential of this technology. As breakthroughs
            continue to occur, we will move closer to the realization of quantum computing’s
            promise.


            As we look ahead, the continued advancement of quantum computing will
            depend on the collaboration between researchers, engineers, and businesses.
            The journey to fully functional QC is still in its early stages, but the
            progress made in 2024 demonstrates that the quantum revolution is well
            underway. By staying informed and engaged with the [developments](https://www.localitcompanies.com/boston-ma/)
            in this field, businesses and individuals alike can prepare for the transformative
            impact that quantum computing is set to have on the world.'
