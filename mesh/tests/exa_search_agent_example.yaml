      response: "Recent developments in quantum computing showcase significant advancements\
        \ across hardware, error correction, and application development. Here's a\
        \ summary of key trends and breakthroughs: \n\n**1. Quantum Supremacy and\
        \ Performance:**\n*   D-Wave has reportedly achieved quantum computational\
        \ supremacy on a useful problem related to materials discovery using its annealing\
        \ quantum computer. This computer performed a magnetic materials simulation\
        \ in minutes that would take classical supercomputers nearly a million years\
        \ and vast amounts of electricity. (D-Wave Quantum)\n*   Aalto University\
        \ physicists have set a new benchmark in quantum computing, achieving a record-breaking\
        \ millisecond coherence in a transmon qubit, nearly doubling previous limits.\
        \ (ScienceDaily)\n\n**2. Advancements in Qubits and Error Correction:**\n\
        *   **Logical Qubits:** The focus is shifting from physical (error-prone)\
        \ qubits to logical qubits, which are arrangements of physical qubits designed\
        \ to protect against errors. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Quantinuum,\
        \ Rigetti, Riverlane, and IBM have demonstrated progress in experimental logical\
        \ qubits, showing reduced error rates as more physical qubits encode logical\
        \ ones. (Moody's)\n*   **Novel Physical Qubits:** Research continues into\
        \ improving physical qubits to boost the performance of logical qubits. Examples\
        \ include the demonstration of hole spin qubits (University of Basel), theoretical\
        \ use of \"Majorana fermions\" as topological qubits (University College Dublin),\
        \ and the development of a mechanical qubit (ETH Zurich). (Moody's)\n*   **Error\
        \ Correction Techniques:** Google's \"Willow\" quantum computing chip has\
        \ shown significant advancements in error correction. Other companies like\
        \ Alice & Bob and Riverlane are also developing new quantum error correction\
        \ architectures and hardware-based decoders with enhanced speed and efficiency.\
        \ (McKinsey & Company, Moody's)\n*   **Stabilizing Qubits:** Innovation in\
        \ 2024 has largely focused on stabilizing qubits, signaling that quantum technology\
        \ could soon become a reliable part of critical industries' technology infrastructure.\
        \ (McKinsey & Company)\n\n**3. Hardware and Architecture:**\n*   **Modular\
        \ Quantum Computers:** Researchers are developing modular superconducting\
        \ qubits that can be linked with high fidelity, allowing for reconfigurability,\
        \ upgrades, and scalability, similar to LEGO bricks. (ScienceDaily)\n*   **Specialized\
        \ Hardware/Software:** Many companies are developing specialized quantum computers\
        \ for specific problems to achieve earlier commercial value, rather than focusing\
        \ solely on universal quantum computers. (Moody's)\n*   **Interconnected Devices:**\
        \ There's a trend towards networking noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ)\
        \ devices together. Companies like Photonic and QuTech have demonstrated distributed\
        \ entanglement and connections between quantum computers in different cities,\
        \ while IBM is building L-couplers to scale its systems. (Moody's)\n*   **New\
        \ Quantum Chips:** Microsoft unveiled \"Majorana 1,\" a quantum chip powered\
        \ by a topological core, aiming to accelerate the development of large-scale,\
        \ fault-tolerant quantum computing by being less prone to errors and more\
        \ resistant to environmental noise. (Electronicspecifier)\n*   **50-qubit\
        \ Quantum Computer:** VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and IQM Quantum\
        \ Computers have launched Europe's first 50-qubit superconducting quantum\
        \ computer, now accessible to researchers and companies. (Electronicspecifier)\n\
        \n**4. Software and Applications:**\n*   **Software Abstraction Layers:**\
        \ Companies are designing interfaces to make quantum computers easier to use,\
        \ abstracting away the complexities of quantum algorithms and hardware. (Moody's)\n\
        *   **Quantum Communication:** This field is gaining traction for secure information\
        \ transfer, with a market estimated to reach $10.5 billion to $14.9 billion\
        \ by 2035. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is a commercially mature vertical\
        \ within this space. (McKinsey & Company)\n*   **Quantum Sensing:** This field\
        \ is entering a pivotal phase with real-world applications emerging in defense\
        \ and semiconductors. Notable advances include NASA's ultracold quantum sensor\
        \ in space and new quantum magnetometers for GPS-denied environments. (McKinsey\
        \ & Company)\n\n**5. Investment and Market Growth:**\n*   Investment in quantum\
        \ technology start-ups surged in 2024, reaching nearly $2.0 billion globally,\
        \ a 50% increase from 2023. Public funding accounted for 34% of this total,\
        \ showing increased government urgency. (McKinsey & Company)\n*   The total\
        \ quantum technology market (computing, communication, sensing) could generate\
        \ up to $97 billion in revenue worldwide by 2035, with quantum computing capturing\
        \ the largest share. (McKinsey & Company)\n\nThese developments indicate a\

              Research


              ## First to Demonstrate Quantum Supremacy on Useful, Real-World Problem


              Materials discovery is a computationally complex, energy-intensive and
              expensive task. Today’s supercomputers and high-performance computing
              (HPC) centers, which are built with tens of thousands of GPUs, do not
              always have the computational processing power to conduct complex materials
              simulations in a timely or energy-efficient manner. For decades, scientists
              have theorized and aspired to build a quantum computer capable of solving
              complex materials simulation problems beyond the reach of classical
              computers.


              D-Wave''s advancements in quantum hardware have made it possible for
              its annealing quantum computers to process these types of problems for
              the first time.

              #### The Challenge


              An international collaboration of scientists led by D-Wave set out to
              answer the following: Can quantum beat classical in performing simulations
              of quantum dynamics in programmable spin glasses across multiple lattices,
              different evolution times and computation of a multiplicity of important
              properties—a computationally hard magnetic materials simulation problem
              with known applications to business and science?


              #### The Compute


              The simulations were run on both D-Wave’s Advantage2 prototype annealing

              applicability of large-scale quantum computing. Through rigorous benchmarking
              of quantum annealers

              against state-of-the-art classical methods, it convincingly establishes
              a quantum advantage in tackling practical problems, revealing the transformative
              potential of

              quantum computing at an unprecedented scale.”

              “Although large-scale, fully error corrected quantum computers are years
              in the future, quantum annealers can probe the features of quantum systems
              today. In an elegant paper, the D-Wave group has used a large-scale
              quantum annealer to uncover patterns of entanglement in a complex quantum
              system that lie far beyond the reach of the most powerful classical
              computer. The D-Wave result shows the promise of quantum annealers for
              exploring exotic quantum effects in a wide variety of systems.”

              ##### Quantum computing’s six most important trends for 2025


              The financial industry is anticipated to become one of the earliest
              adopters of commercially useful quantum computing technologies. These
              technologies are expected to become available within the next few years,
              making it more important than ever to follow experimental developments.
              Therefore, as 2024 comes to a close, we pause to reflect upon what has
              recently transpired and look for trends we believe will continue through
              2025 and beyond. This exercise has led to the identification of six
              trends, each of which we cover through 2024 reports and announcements:


              1. More experiments with logical qubits

              2. More specialized hardware/software (as opposed to universal quantum
              computing)

              3. More networking noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices together

              4. More layers of software abstraction

              5. More workforce development tools

              6. Improved and novel physical qubits


              These trends are not ordered by significance or likelihood; we see all
              of these as equally likely.


              ##### More experiments with logical qubits


              In “The road to useful quantum computing,” published on February 13,
              2024, we reviewed the events of 2023 that started shifting our conversations
              from physical qubits in 2022 to logical qubits in 2024. Whereas a “physical
              qubit” refers to actual error-prone hardware, a “logical qubit” is an
              arrangement of these physical qubits that encodes information in such
              a way as to protect against errors \[1\]. We chronologically cited 19
              achievements — many of which were experimental — from 23 organizations;
              alphabetically, they are: Alice & Bob, Amazon Web Services, Caltech,
              Chinese Academy of Sciences, Cornell, ETH Zurich, Fuzhou University,
              Google, Harvard, IBM, MIT, PsiQuantum, QC Design, Quantinuum, QuEra
              Computing, QuTech, Riverlane, Tsinghua University, the University of
              Chicago, the University of Science and Technology of China, the University
              of Sheffield, the University of Stuttgart,  and Yale. We noted that
              by early 2024, QuEra and Infleqtion had already published their logical
              qubit roadmaps, while Alice & Bob had teased that a logical qubit roadmap
              would be forthcoming \[2\].


              In 2024, we observed continued experimentation:


              - On August 27, Google announced that it had demonstrated a quantum
              memory with below-threshold error rates and double the coherence lifetimes
              as compared with physical qubits \[3\].

              - On September 10, Microsoft and Quantinuum announced that they had
              entangled 12 logical qubits, triple the logical qubit count from six
              months prior \[4\]. The physical error rate of 0.024 was brought down
              to a logical error rate of 0.0011, leading to the first ever chemistry
              simulation combining high-performance computing (HPC), artificial intelligence
              (AI), and quality control (QC) \[5\].

              - On October 31, Rigetti and Riverlane announced that they had demonstrated
              error correction with gate speeds fast enough to support heterogeneous
              quantum-classical processing \[6\].

              - On December 3, an IBM Quantum team announced that they had demonstrated
              the entanglement of logical qubits using overlapping codes, applying
              a method thought to be impractical with limited connectivity \[7\].

              - On December 9, Google announced that its Willow chip demonstrated
              below-threshold error correction, lowering error rates as more physical
              qubits encode logical qubits \[8\].


              We’ve also seen growth in the number of logical qubit roadmaps. In addition
              to the three companies we mentioned, Inside Quantum Technology mentioned
              IBM Quantum, Google, and Microsoft in “The quantum roadmap battle of
              logical qubits,” which was published on February 27, 2024 \[9\]. Since
              that time, we have added eight more to this list (alphabetically, given
              that not all of them are dated):


              - Diraq \[10\]

              - IonQ \[11\]

              - IQM \[12\]

              - Pasqal \[13\]

              - PsiQuantum \[14\]

              - Quantinuum \[15\]

              - Quandela \[16\]

              - Xanadu \[17\]


              While this may not be an exhaustive list, it shows a continuing trend
              either way. We’ve gone from talking about physical qubits to demonstrating
              logical qubits to showing that logical qubits lower error rates. The
              growth in logical qubit roadmaps requires accelerated experimentation,
              especially considering that quantum computers based on logical qubits
              are being promised within the next few years.


              ##### More specialized hardware/software (as opposed to universal QC)


              Building a universal quantum computer — a quantum computer that can
              run any quantum algorithm — is hard \[18\]. If it were easy, we would
              already have one. While this is still the end goal, multiple companies
              are developing specialized quantum computers for specific problems to
              achieve earlier commercial value:


              - Bleximo is building full-stack superconducting application-specific
              systems with co-designed processors, software, and control stacks \[19\].

              - Qilimanjaro is building quantum app-specific integrated circuits (QASICs)
              for superconducting analog quantum computers with full stacks co-designed
              for specific problems \[20\].

              - QuiX is building special-purpose photonic quantum computers for specific
              optimization and simulation problems \[21\].

              - On November 19, QuEra launched a full-stack quantum algorithm co-design
              program to optimize hardware, software, and applications for specific
              problems \[22\].


              It’s reasonable to assume that this list will continue to grow. Likewise,
              it’s presumably easier to sell a special-purpose quantum computer that
              provides a commercial advantage for one or a few problems than it is
              to sell a general-purpose quantum computer that does not yet provide
              commercial advantages for any problems.


              ##### More networking NISQ devices together


              Two ways to scale up a quantum computer are to add more qubits to a
              single quantum computer or to interconnect multiple quantum computers,
              creating a single virtual quantum computer with a higher qubit count.
              In 2024, several companies announced larger individual processors, but
              there were also developments in connecting multiple processors:


              - On May 30, Photonic announced that it had demonstrated distributed
              entanglement, linking qubits within separate quantum computers \[23\].

              - On October 30, QuTech announced that it had connected two small quantum
              computers in two different cities \[24\].

              - IBM is building L-couplers to scale its systems \[25\]. On November
              21, it announced that it had classically linked two 127-qubit quantum
              processors to create a virtual 142-qubit system \[26\].


              There is far more research going into quantum networks than the examples
              here, but not all of it links to quantum computers just yet. Researchers
              are still developing the infrastructure. However, experimental demonstrations
              of interconnected and internetworked quantum computers are bound to
              lead to experimentation with distributed applications using more of
              these nascent quantum networks.


              ##### More layers of software abstraction


              A major challenge in adopting quantum computers is learning how to use
              them. Quantum algorithms and quantum hardware are significantly different
              from their classical counterparts. Fortunately, multiple companies are
              designing interfaces so users might not need to know anything about
              quantum computers:


              - Multiverse Computing’s Singularity uses a spreadsheet to abstract
              away whether it is using quantum or quantum-inspired computing to solve
              optimization problems \[27\].

              - The Strangeworks model allows you to define your problem. Once you’ve
              done that, you simply select a solver — quantum or otherwise — and run
              it \[28\].


              Quantastica’s Quantum Algorithm Generator doesn’t completely abstract
              quantum technology, but it converts a classical function into a quantum
              circuit \[29\]. This lowers the barrier to entry but still requires
              some knowledge of quantum computing.


              Other companies are attempting to be hardware-agnostic, removing the
              hardware layers so it’s easier to develop cross-platform applications.
              However, this still requires a considerable amount of quantum computing
              knowledge. These solutions are halfway there, though, and simply need
              the software component to join this list.


              ##### More workforce development tools


              There is no shortage of introductory quantum computing materials, but
              the vast majority are self-paced or structured for individuals. At least
              two companies offer programs with enterprises in mind, recognizing the
              need for workforce development rather than just career development:


              - Q-CTRL’s Black Opal is an interactive online learning platform that
              individuals can use, but it can also be embedded into a formal curriculum
              with a capstone project, exams, and automatic grading \[30\].

              - QURECA offers customized training programs tailored to organizational
              needs, various roles, and different business sectors \[31\]. There is
              also a team-building program that bridges quantum computing hard skills
              and enterprise soft skills \[32\].


              MIT offers a two-course program from MIT xPRO that is designed for working
              professionals and awards a certificate. Professor Peter Shor, the developer
              behind Shor’s algorithm, and Professor Isaac Chuang, co-author of “The
              Bible of quantum computing,” are two of the instructors \[33\]. It is
              easy to imagine similar programs being adapted to individual enterprises,
              where an entire course consists of employees from the same organization.


              ##### Improved and novel physical qubits


              Two ways to lower error rates on quantum computers are to improve the
              physical qubits and to implement high-overhead error correction codes.
              It is widely believed that quantum error correction (QEC) will be necessary;
              however, research continues into improving physical qubits, which in
              turn boosts the performance of the logical qubits: \[34\]


              - On May 6, the University of Basel announced the demonstration of hole
              spin qubits, which use the spins of missing electrons in semiconductors
              and require fewer components than electron spin qubits \[35\].

              - On September 19, University College Dublin announced that "split-electrons,"
              so-called “Majorana fermions,” can theoretically be used as topological
              qubits \[36\].

              - On September 21, Brookhaven National Laboratory announced it had used
              constriction junctions, which simplify chip fabrication to enable mass
              production \[37\].

              - On November 26, The Quantum Insider reported that Quantinuum, Harvard,
              and Caltech experimentally demonstrated the first “true topological
              qubit,” robustly encoding information in systems’ relationship patterns
              instead of within the systems \[38\].

              - On November 26, as part of the Q-LEAP project, RIKEN and Toshiba announced
              a double-transmon coupler (DTC), which has been proposed to improve
              gate fidelity \[39\].

              - On November 26, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ephos uses glass
              chips instead of silicon to reduce energy consumption and information
              loss \[40\].

              - On December 4, the American Physical Society reported in its Physics
              publication that ETH Zurich demonstrated a mechanical qubit consisting
              of two sapphire chips, with a superconducting qubit on top with a mechanical
              resonator below \[41\].


              It’s impossible to know everything that is being researched at any given
              time. We can assume, however, that research continues in universities
              and labs around the world, as well as at many quantum computing companies.


              ##### Conclusion


              While no one has a crystal ball, we can confidently predict 2025 trends
              based on analyses of 2024 and 2023. The exciting part of this is the
              unknowns. If we were in 2022, we probably wouldn’t be predicting the
              experimental demonstration of logical qubits in 2023, but that happened.
              We’re excited to find out what we’ve missed, and we hope you’ll join
              us throughout the year as we continue along the path toward fault-tolerant
              quantum computing.

              Our fourth annual _Quantum Technology Monitor_ report shows that surging
              investment and faster-than-expected innovation could propel the quantum
              market to $100 billion in a decade.

              **When it comes to quantum technology (QT),** investment is surging
              and breakthroughs are multiplying. The United Nations has designated
              2025 the International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, celebrating
              100 years since the initial development of quantum mechanics. Our research
              confirms that QT is gaining widespread traction worldwide. McKinsey’s
              fourth annual _Quantum Technology Monitor_ covers last year’s breakthroughs,
              investment trends, and emerging opportunities in this fast-evolving
              landscape.


              In 2024, the QT industry saw a shift from growing quantum bits (qubits)
              to stabilizing qubits—and that marks a turning point. It signals to
              mission-critical industries that QT could soon become a safe and reliable
              component of their technology infrastructure. To that end, this year’s
              report provides a special deep dive into the fast-growing market of
              quantum communication, which could unlock the security needed for widespread
              QT uptake.


              ## What is quantum technology?


              Quantum technology encompasses three subfields:


              - Quantum computing is a new computing paradigm that capitalizes on
              the laws of quantum mechanics to provide significant performance improvement
              for certain applications, and to enable new territories of computing
              beyond existing classical computing.

              - Quantum communication is the secure transfer of quantum information
              across distances and could ensure security of communication even in
              the face of unlimited quantum computing power.

              - Quantum sensing includes a new generation of sensors, based on quantum
              systems, that provide measurements of various quantities (for example,
              electromagnetic fields, gravity, or time) and that are orders of magnitude
              more sensitive than classical sensors.


              Our new research shows that the three core pillars of QT—quantum computing,
              quantum communication, and quantum sensing—could together generate up
              to $97 billion in revenue worldwide by 2035. Quantum computing will
              capture the bulk of that revenue, growing from $4 billion in revenue
              in 2024 to as much as $72 billion in 2035 (see sidebar “What is quantum
              technology?”). While QT will affect many industries, the chemicals,
              life sciences, finance, and mobility industries will see the most growth.


              ## About the report


              McKinsey initiated its annual quantum technology report in 2021 to track
              the rapidly evolving quantum technology landscape. We analyze three
              principal areas of the field: quantum computing, quantum communication,
              and quantum sensing. The analysis is based on input from various sources,
              including publicly available data, expert interviews, and proprietary
              McKinsey analyses. The conclusions and estimations have been cross-checked
              across market databases and validated through investor reports, press
              releases, and expert input. Because not all deal values are publicly
              disclosed and databases are updated continuously, our research does
              not provide a definitive or exhaustive list of start-ups, funding activities,
              investment splits, or patents and publications.


              We conducted extensive analysis to project the 2035 global market sizes
              for each of the three pillars of QT. We found that by 2035, quantum
              computing could be worth $28 billion to $72 billion, quantum communication
              could be worth $11 billion to $15 billion, and quantum sensing could
              be worth $7 billion to $10 billion—for a total of as much as $97 billion.
              This growth shows no signs of slowing. We predict that by 2040, the
              total QT market could reach $198 billion. We present our market size
              estimates as a range because of the large variance in potential technological
              progress, adoption rates, and scaling opportunities for QT in the decade
              to come (see sidebar “About the report”).


              ## Gaining momentum in investments


              ### More funding for start-ups


              Private and public investors are increasingly confident that QT start-ups
              will generate measurable value. In 2024 they poured nearly $2.0 billion
              into QT start-ups worldwide, a 50 percent increase compared to $1.3
              billion in 2023. Private sector funding from venture capital and private
              equity firms accounted for two-thirds of that total, or about $1.3 billion,
              a decline of 19 percentage points compared with 2023. Public funding
              took up the reins, increasing 19 percentage points relative to 2023
              to account for 34 percent of 2024 funding, or $680 million (Exhibit
              1). This shows increased urgency from governments to invest in QT’s
              potential.


              Significant private and public entities investing in QT start-ups in
              2024 include SoftBank’s partnership with Quantinuum and Aramco’s investment
              in Pasqal. Japan’s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science
              and Technology’s collaboration with QuEra and IonQ and Qatar Investment
              Authority’s partnership with Alice & Bob are other examples of major
              investments in this space.


              Two late-stage start-ups, PsiQuantum and Quantinuum, received half of
              total investment in 2024, underscoring investors’ confidence that mature,
              established start-ups will continue to grow. Our research indicates
              this is already happening; quantum computing companies alone generated
              $650 million to $750 million in revenue in 2024 and are expected to
              surpass $1 billion in 2025. This revenue surge comes from continuous
              growth in the deployment of quantum hardware across private industry
              and the defense sector.


              When it comes to early-stage companies, most new start-ups launched
              in 2024 are developing equipment and components or application software.
              Overall, we anticipate a value shift with QT start-ups moving from hardware
              toward software in the next five to ten years.


              Increasingly, these new start-ups are being created in innovation “clusters”
              that group together start-up accelerators, academic institutions, research
              centers, and investors. Quantum start-ups are actively partnering with
              regional and national authorities to create these clusters, which often
              include the construction of greenfield QT manufacturing and computing
              facilities. There are several emerging hubs in Asia, especially in Abu
              Dhabi, Tel Aviv, and Tokyo, and growing clusters in the United States—in
              Illinois and Maryland, for example.


              ### A surge in public funding


              Global governments’ $680 million worth of investments in QT start-ups
              in 2024 was only part of their commitment to the sector. Overall, governments
              announced $1.8 billion in funding for all types of QT endeavors in 2024.
              For example, the Australian government announced a $620 million financial
              package for PsiQuantum to build the world’s first utility-scale, fault-tolerant
              quantum computer in Brisbane.1“PsiQuantum to build world’s first utility-scale,
              fault-tolerant quantum computer in Australia,” PsiQuantum, April 29,
              2024. Meanwhile, the State of Illinois announced a $500 million investment
              in the development of a quantum park.2For more, see the website of the
              Illinois Quantum & Microelectronics Park. Asian investments also rose
              in 2024, led by Singapore’s approximately $222 million investment in
              QT research and talent.3Matt Swayne, “Singapore invests s$300 million
              in national quantum strategy,” Quantum Insider, May 30, 2024. Five of
              the 19 new QT start-ups founded in 2024 are based in Asia, underscoring
              the region’s emerging dominance in the field.


              The government-backed QT financing trend shows no signs of slowing.
              In fact, it accelerated in the first months of 2025 when Japan announced
              a $7.4 billion bet on the sector and Spain committed to investing $900
              million, bringing announcements for public financing to more than $10
              billion (Exhibit 2).


              ## Breakthrough innovations


              For the first time since McKinsey began monitoring the QT market four
              years ago, we see a shift from development to deployment. Much of the
              innovation that emerged in 2024 has made QT safer and more secure. And
              while the QT start-up ecosystem is fertile ground for potential breakthroughs,
              leading technology companies drove the bulk of change in 2024. Companies
              such as Amazon, Google, IBM, and Microsoft continued to progress in
              quantum innovation, unveiling key breakthroughs that signal a new era
              for the industry. Notable recent advancements from large companies include
              the suppression of error rates relative to the number of qubits; the
              development of multiple high-fidelity qubits; and substantial reductions
              in the cost of quantum error correction.


              ### Quantum control solutions


              Our research shows that start-ups and large companies also made progress
              in 2024 within quantum control solutions—the hardware and software that
              enable quantum systems to perform critical functions such as qubit initialization,
              gate operations, error correction, and readouts. For example, Australian
              start-up Q-CTRL partnered with Nvidia and OQC to overcome computational
              bottlenecks in error suppression.4“Q-CTRL, NVIDIA, and OQC collaborate
              to accelerate quantum error suppression,” _Quantum Computing Report_,
              March 21, 2025. Other companies also made progress, including IBM, Keysight,
              Kipu Quantum, Quantum Machines, Qedma, and Zurich Instruments.

              ### The critical role of error correction


              Error correction, a critical element of quantum control, emerged as
              a key innovation in 2024, with Google’s Willow quantum computing chip
              demonstrating significant advancements in error correction and performance.
              With 105 physical qubits, Willow can perform certain complex calculations
              exponentially faster than supercomputers and with a low error rate.5_The
              Keyword_, “Meet Willow, our state-of-the-art quantum chip,” blog entry
              by Hartmut Neven, Google, December 9, 2024. Start-ups, too, showed progress
              on error correction. For example, Alice & Bob presented a new quantum
              error correction architecture,6“Alice & Bob advance quantum computing
              with fewer qubits needed for error correction,” Alice & Bob, January
              23, 2024. Riverlane unveiled a hardware-based quantum error decoder
              with enhanced speed and efficiency,7Ben Barber et al., “A real-time,
              scalable, fast and resource-efficient decoder for a quantum computer,”
              _Nature Electronics_, 2025, Volume 8. QuEra launched a logical quantum
              processor based on reconfigurable atom arrays,8Dolev Bluvstein et al.,
              “Logical quantum processor based on reconfigurable atom arrays,” _Nature_,
              2024, Volume 626. and Atom Computing collaborated with Microsoft to
              deliver quantum error correction.9John Timmer, “Microsoft and Atom Computing
              combine for quantum error correction demo,” _Ars Technica_, November
              19, 2024.


              As the number of qubits grows, effective error correction—as well as
              suppression and mitigation—is no longer optional. Ensuring QT systems
              are less prone to error is essential for achieving the stability and
              accuracy needed to deploy quantum applications at scale.


              ### Progress on patents


              With an eye to cementing early advantage in the QT sector, companies
              are patenting their breakthroughs. Our research shows a 13 percent increase
              in the number of QT patents granted in 2024 compared to a year earlier.
              IBM had the highest number (191), followed by Google with 168.


              On a country level, China and the United States filed the most QT patent
              applications in 2024, with China leading in quantum computing patents
              (Exhibit 3). Meanwhile, the United States led in quantum communication
              patents, propelled by the efforts of national labs such as the National
              Institute of Standards and Technology and research institutes. These
              advancements highlight the United States’ strategic focus on advancing
              the field of quantum security.


              ### Gaining traction in quantum communication


              The potential arrival of Q-Day, when quantum computers become powerful
              enough to break current encryption standards and critical digital infrastructure
              worldwide, represents a major shift in security. Companies will need
              to rethink their global security strategies—and adopting quantum communication
              will be a cornerstone of their new approach. Quantum communication technologies
              allow the secure transfer of quantum information at scale, and the market
              is growing quickly.


              By analyzing current product offerings and emerging technological trends,
              we estimate that the total quantum communication market size was $1.2
              billion in 2024 and that it will reach $10.5 billion to $14.9 billion
              by 2035—representing a CAGR of 22 to 25 percent over the next decade
              (Exhibit 4).


              The quantum communication landscape comprises three key categories—security,
              networks, and services. Within these, we analyzed six important verticals—quantum
              key distribution solutions, post-quantum cryptography (PQC), modular
              interconnects, regional networks, quantum global internet, and quantum
              communication services. In 2024, the vertical with the most commercial
              maturity was PQC, which focuses on building algorithms to withstand
              attacks from quantum computers. PQC technology is critical to ensure
              data security on Q-day and beyond.


              Our research shows that governments are currently the largest purchasers
              of quantum communication technologies, at approximately 57 percent of
              all purchases in 2024, but the private sector is increasingly adopting
              the technology. By 2035, for instance, our analysis shows that the telecommunications
              sector is expected to account for 16 to 26 percent of overall spending
              on quantum communication products.


              The quantum communication value chain ranges from components, hardware,
              and application software to quantum network operators and services.
              Hardware is still emerging but holds significant promise. For instance,
              long-distance communication requires quantum repeaters, or hardware
              devices that amplify the signal. Start-ups and big-tech players alike
              are racing to develop repeaters and other hardware, even while the software
              market itself is still small. Doing so will allow companies to get ahead
              in the quantum communication market and be ready with their hardware
              devices when the software side catches up.


              ### Advances in quantum sensing


              Quantum sensing has entered a pivotal phase, and real-world application
              development will be central to unlocking its full potential. The field
              saw significant breakthroughs in 2024 and early 2025, particularly in
              use cases across defense and semiconductors. With quantum sensing technology
              maturing beyond foundational research, the focus is now on production
              and deployment. Notable advances over the past year include NASA’s first
              demonstration of an ultracold quantum sensor in space; Q-CTRL’s use
              of quantum magnetometers to navigate GPS-denied environments; QuantumDiamonds’
              launch of a diamond-based microscopy tool for semiconductor failure
              analysis; and SandboxAQ’s introduction of AQNav, a real-time, AI-driven
              quantum navigation system.10“NASA demonstrates ‘ultra-cool’ quantum
              sensor for first time in space,” NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory, August
              13, 2024; “Q-CTRL overcomes GPS-denial with quantum sensing, achieves

              ## Looking ahead


              QT delivers value not only on its own but also by unlocking powerful
              synergies with other cutting-edge technologies. Our research explores
              how QT could both influence and be shaped by four key innovation domains:
              AI and machine learning, robotics, sustainability and climate tech,
              and cryptography and cybersecurity.


              - **AI and machine learning** have the potential to accelerate quantum
              hardware development through AI-driven material discovery, while quantum
              computing offers transformative leaps in computational power that could
              redefine the scale and speed of AI model training.

              - **Robotics** plays a key role in advancing quantum technology by streamlining
              the manufacturing of quantum components. In turn, robotics can potentially
              benefit from all three pillars of quantum technology: Quantum computing
              can boost computing power and software optimization, quantum communication
              can support secure networks, and quantum sensors can enhance the precision
              of robots.

              - **Sustainability and climate tech** stand to benefit from quantum
              advances, particularly in computing, because these advances can accelerate
              material discovery, improve modeling of complex systems such as molecular
              interactions or climate forecasting, and optimize production processes.

              - **Cryptography and cybersecurity** could be fundamentally reshaped
              by quantum technology, posing new risks—such as QT’s potential ability
              to break current encryption—while also boosting next-generation protections,
              including key distribution, random-number generation, and cryptographic
              methods designed to withstand quantum attacks.

              ## Quantum computer


              A **quantum computer** is a device for computation that makes direct
              use of quantum mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement,
              to perform operations on data. The basic principle behind quantum computation
              is that quantum properties can be used to represent data and perform
              operations on these data.


              Although quantum computing is still in its infancy, experiments have
              been carried out in which quantum computational operations were executed
              on a very small number of qubits ( **qu** antum **bi** nary digi **ts**).
              Both practical and theoretical research continues with interest, and
              many national government and military funding agencies support quantum
              computing research to develop quantum computers for both civilian and
              national security purposes, such as cryptanalysis.


              If large-scale quantum computers can be built, they will be able to
              solve certain problems much faster than any of our current classical
              computers (for example Shor''s algorithm). Quantum computers are different
              from other computers such as DNA computers and traditional computers
              based on transistors. Some computing architectures such as optical computers
              may use classical superposition of electromagnetic waves. Without some
              specifically quantum mechanical resources such as entanglement, it is
              conjectured that an exponential advantage over classical computers is
              not possible.

              # VTT and IQM launch Europe’s first 50-qubit quantum computer


              VTT Technical Research Centre of Finland and IQM Quantum Computers have
              completed and launched Europe’s first 50-qubit superconducting quantum
              computer, now open to researchers and companies through the VTT QX quantum
              computing service.


              - [Quantum Tech](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/)


              4 March 2025


              [byEditor](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/author/eseditor/)


              The new 50-qubit quantum computer further strengthens Finland’s position
              among the countries capable of [developing and investing in quantum
              computing](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/developing-next-generation-amplifiers-for-quantum-computers).
              Finland first announced its efforts in quantum computing development
              back in November 2020 with a total budget of €20.7 million from the
              Finnish government to develop a 50-qubit quantum computer.


              The 50-qubit quantum computer opens today for use by companies and researchers
              in universities and research institutes through the VTT QC quantum computing
              service. The quantum computer offers industries [an opportunity to develop
              applications for quantum computing](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/state-of-quantum-2024-report-capital-sovereignty-and-readiness)
              and to work on them in a practical way.


              “Developing and building a 50-qubit quantum computer demonstrates that
              Finland is one of the global leaders in the field. With this quantum
              computer, we can develop applications and new algorithms for material
              modelling and simulation, optimisation problems, and artificial intelligence,”
              says Erja Turunen, Executive Vice President, VTT.


              “Now is the perfect time for companies to consider how quantum computing
              could benefit them in their own business. Leadership in critical technologies
              like quantum computing is crucial for Finnish society. We need to be
              capable of both building the required hardware as well as using it for
              practical applications. Now with the 50-qubit quantum computer completed,
              it is time for the applications development by the entire Finnish ecosystem,”
              she continues.


              The project was phased into three parts so the community in Finland
              can take advantage of the new technology as early as possible. The 5-qubit
              quantum computer was completed in 2021. In the spring of 2022, it was
              connected to the Internet via CSC’s LUMI supercomputer for the use of
              Finnish researchers and later also more widely for business users.


              [The 20-qubit computer](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/finland-launches-a-20-qubit-quantum-computer)
              was completed in 2023, and in the third phase, it was upgraded to 50
              qubits. A 50-qubit quantum computer is capable of performing such calculations
              which are not anymore possible with a classical computer, [making this
              a significant milestone.](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/looking-to-scale-up-finland-s-next-quantum-computer)
              Thanks to the new chip technology, it was possible to significantly
              reduce computer noise and increase the number of qubits used in calculations.


              “The delivery of this quantum computer is a significant milestone in
              our technology roadmap towards large-scale quantum computing with applications
              in quantum machine learning, optimisation, or simulations,” says Dr.
              Jan Goetz, Co-CEO and Co-Founder of IQM Quantum Computers. “Our collaboration
              with VTT to develop the 50-qubit system serves as a baseline for our
              IQM Radiance 54-qubit quantum computer, a product we are shipping to
              our customers worldwide. We are now at full speed to deliver on the
              growing demand for our quantum computers to drive scientific breakthroughs
              and ultimately reach quantum advantage,” he discloses.


              Quantum computers were developed as a joint development project, where
              both parties, VTT and IQM, developed part of the technology. VTT especially
              developed the superconducting TWPA amplifiers, used for readout of the
              qubit signals, as well as quantum processor chip-level integration and
              packaging solutions. The superconducting TWPA amplifiers developed and
              manufactured by VTT are in high demand within the quantum technology
              industry in Europe. VTT’s spin-off company, [Arctic Instruments,](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/developing-next-generation-amplifiers-for-quantum-computers)
              is commercialising VTT’s TWPA technology.


              VTT also made significant leaps forward in the manufacturing of qubits
              and integration technologies, and VTT is now offering them as a commercial
              service. The manufacturing methods used in quantum technologies now
              include the Josephson junction technology, superconducting Through Silicon
              Vias (TSVs) and superconducting flip chip integration methods. During
              the innovative 50-qubit quantum computer co-development, VTT also launched
              another quantum technology spin-off, SemiQon, which is developing semiconducting
              qubits.


              Finland’s quantum technology business ecosystem is growing, with multiple
              new [startup companies](https://startupsmagazine.co.uk/search-view-article?search=quantum)
              emerging in the last few years. The BusinessQ community, operating as
              part of InstituteQ, Finland’s quantum technology research and development
              ecosystem, brings together different actors in the Finnish quantum value
              chain. BusinessQ currently has more than 25 companies as its members,
              from technology developers to end-users. The new quantum computer provides
              new opportunities for the companies in the ecosystem to develop commercial
              applications and products, deploy quantum technology, and build new
              business.


              The new 50-qubit quantum computer is located at VTT’s premises in Micronova
              in Espoo, Finland.

              # Majorana 1: Microsoft’s new quantum chip


              Microsoft has unveiled Majorana 1, a quantum chip that promises a significant
              leap forward in the development of large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum
              computing. The company claims that this breakthrough could accelerate
              the arrival of practical quantum computers from decades to just a few
              years – a stark contrast to the words of NVIDIA’s CEO earlier this year.


              - [Quantum Tech](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/)


              20 February 2025


              [byEditor](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/author/eseditor/)


              ### What is Majorana 1?


              Majorana 1 is Microsoft’s first Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) powered
              by a topological core, an entirely new approach to [quantum computing](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/quantum-computing-the-whats-whens-and-hows).
              The chip is built using a novel material known as a ‘topoconductor,’
              which enables the creation of stable and scalable topological qubits.
              Unlike traditional quantum computing approaches that rely on highly
              fragile qubits, Microsoft’s design is intended to be less prone to errors
              and more resistant to environmental noise.


              Microsoft claims that Majorana 1 has the potential to scale up to one
              million qubits on a single chip, a milestone that would bring quantum
              computing significantly closer to commercial reality. This is a stark
              contrast to current quantum processors, which typically operate with
              fewer than 100 qubits and struggle with error correction.


              Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, emphasised the significance of this
              development, stating: “Majorana 1 represents a fundamental shift in
              quantum computing. With this breakthrough, we are not just making incremental
              progress; we are laying the groundwork for a future where quantum computing
              becomes a practical reality in the near term.”


              ### The magic behind Majorana 1


              At the heart of the chip is a superconducting nanowire made from indium
              arsenide and aluminium. This material combination enables the formation
              of Majorana zero modes, a theoretical particle that was first proposed
              in the 1930s but has been notoriously difficult to demonstrate experimentally.


              Microsoft’s topoconductors allow the creation and manipulation of Majorana
              zero modes, forming the basis for topological qubits. These qubits are
              distinct from traditional superconducting qubits (such as those used
              by Google and IBM) because they are inherently protected from certain
              types of errors, making them more stable and reliable.


              Unlike standard quantum computing methods, which require thousands of
              physical qubits to create a single logical qubit, topological qubits
              naturally resist errors, reducing the overhead for quantum error correction.
              Microsoft has also developed a novel readout system that reportedly
              achieves 99% accuracy in qubit state detection.


              Chetan Nayak, Corporate Vice President of Quantum Hardware at Microsoft,
              explained: “Majorana 1 is built on nearly two decades of research and
              development. By leveraging topoconductors, we have developed a quantum
              chip that is not only scalable but also inherently robust against errors—an
              essential step toward building a fault-tolerant quantum computer.”


              ### How does it compare to its rivals at Google and IBM?


              Microsoft’s announcement comes at a time when Google and IBM are also
              making significant advancements in quantum computing. In late 2024,
              [Google unveiled its “Willow” quantum chip](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/what-s-the-deal-with-google-s-quantum-chip),
              which demonstrated quantum supremacy by solving complex calculations
              in minutes that would take classical supercomputers thousands of years.
              IBM, meanwhile, has projected that large-scale quantum computing will
              be commercially viable by 2033.


              Microsoft, however, believes it can achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing
              much sooner, stating that its approach could bring quantum breakthroughs
              “in years, not decades.” If successful, this would place Microsoft ahead
              in the race to develop a scalable quantum computer.


              ### Applications of Majorana 1


              Microsoft envisions Majorana 1 unlocking solutions for some of the world’s
              most challenging problems, including:


              - Drug discovery – Accelerating the identification of new medicines

              Paul Stevenson, Professor of Physics at the University of Surrey, offered
              a cautious perspective, stating: “While Majorana 1 is an exciting advancement,
              the path to scalable and practical quantum computing remains complex.
              Independent verification and further experimental validation will be
              critical to confirming Microsoft’s claims.”


              ### Microsoft’s collaboration with DARPA and the road ahead


              Microsoft has partnered with DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects
              Agency) as part of its “Utility-Scale Quantum Computing” initiative.
              The company has committed to building a fault-tolerant quantum prototype
              in the coming years, further solidifying its role as a leader in quantum
              research.


              According to Chetan Nayak, Microsoft’s Corporate Vice President of Quantum
              Hardware, the company has been working on this technology for nearly
              two decades. The research leading to Majorana 1 has been peer-reviewed
              and published in Nature, giving credibility to Microsoft’s claims.


              DARPA selected Microsoft and PsiQuantum to progress to the final phase
              of its Underexplored Systems for Utility-Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC)
              program. This initiative, part of DARPA’s broader Quantum Benchmarking
              Initiative (QBI), aims to evaluate and validate innovative approaches
              to building utility-scale quantum computers.


              As part of the US2QC program’s Validation and Co-Design phase, Microsoft
              will work closely with DARPA’s evaluation team to refine and validate
              their quantum computing design. This collaboration involves rigorous
              testing of components and hardware, as well as assessments of system-level
              performance capabilities of major prototypes. The goal is to demonstrate
              the feasibility of constructing a utility-scale quantum computer that
              can address real-world challenges.


              ### Scepticisms & final thoughts


              Despite the excitement surrounding Majorana 1, some experts remain cautious.
              Majorana zero modes have been a topic of scientific controversy, and
              Microsoft previously faced scrutiny when it retracted a 2018 paper claiming
              experimental evidence of these particles.


              While Microsoft’s approach appears promising and its inclusion in _Nature_
              a good sign, independent verification of its claims will be critical.
              Some physicists argue that additional experimental validation is needed
              to confirm that Majorana 1 truly contains Majorana zero modes and is
              not producing false signals from other quasiparticles.


              Microsoft’s Majorana 1 quantum chip is one of the most ambitious attempts
              yet to bridge the gap between theoretical quantum physics and practical
              quantum computing. If the company’s claims hold up to further scrutiny,
              this could be the beginning of a new era in computing – one where quantum
              processors solve problems far beyond the reach of classical machines.


              With its roadmap leading to fault-tolerant, million-qubit quantum systems,
              Microsoft is staking its claim in the future of computing. Whether it
              can deliver on this vision remains to be seen, but one thing is certain:
              the quantum race is heating up, and Microsoft has just made a bold move
              to take the lead.

              # Researchers show speed of two-qubit gate


              The University of Oxford research group led by OQC CSO Dr. Peter Leek
              recently announced research demonstrating a fundamental speed-up of
              the controlled Z-gate in super-conducting qubits, reaching a fidelity
              of 99.8% in only 25ns.


              - [Quantum Tech](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/)


              27 March 2025


              [byEditor](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/author/eseditor/)


              This new approach, presented by Dr Simone Fasciati at the American Physics
              Society’s Global Physics Summit (APS) in Anaheim, employs a new twist
              on the coaxmon circuit architecture that simultaneously eliminates a
              leading source of error and accesses a triple-state degeneracy to further
              speed up one of the fastest existing two-qubit (2Q) gates in [quantum
              computing](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/news/latest/low-energy-spintronics-could-rival-quantum-computing),
              widely used in superconducting circuits.


              The fidelity of 2Q gates is a key metric for building hardware towards
              useful [quantum computers](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/oxford-scientists-link-quantum-computers-via-teleportation).
              The further the fidelity is above a fault-tolerance threshold (typically
              99–99.5%), the more efficiently remaining errors can be corrected using
              quantum error correction. Another major requirement is that gates are
              fast — as well as enabling high fidelities via reduced decoherence,
              the gate speed determines how fast a useful quantum computation can
              be performed. This breakthrough research achieves this high fidelity
              and speed with a particularly simple circuit design, requiring less
              hardware complexity than leading 2Q gate implementations based on tunable
              couplers.


              “It’s one of the fastest 2Q gates ever benchmarked, has a very competitive
              gate fidelity, and one of the simplest circuit designs,” said Dr. Peter
              Leek. “That combination bodes extremely well for scaling up to perform
              fast and useful quantum computing.”


              Commercially useful quantum computation requires fast and high-fidelity
              entangling gates between qubits. In superconducting quantum circuits,
              many common realisations of the two-qubit controlled-Z (CZ) gate involve
              an interaction between a pair of states in the two-excitation subspace.


              Research has proposed theoretically that increasing the number of states
              involved in performing the gate from two to three would increase its
              speed by  a factor of √2. This scheme requires two qubits with exactly
              opposite ‘anharmonicities’, a property of the energy levels of superconducting
              qubits.


              The team based at Dr. Leek’s research lab has experimentally demonstrated
              such a system by coupling a standard transmon with a specially-designed
              qubit of opposite anharmonicity, an inductively shunted transmon. In
              their previous research, they showed that this combination of qubit
              species suppresses ZZ idling error, a leading source of error  in superconducting
              qubits. Typically it is suppressed by adding tunable couplers between
              [qubits](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/successful-superconducting-circuit-for-qubit-control),
              which adds complexity to the hardware. Here it is instead sufficient
              to use a fixed coupling architecture, keeping complexity to a minimum.


              The team was able to observe the expected √2 speed-up and to execute
              a CZ gate in less than 25ns and with a fidelity of 99.8%. Presented
              at the APS Global Physics Summit by Simone D Fasciati from the University
              of Oxford as part of the ‘Superconducting Qubits: Improved Gates’ session,
              the experiments have contributed to exciting progress for superconducting
              qubits.


              “The idea behind this gate speed-up is simple and elegant: to make more
              efficient use of the computational resources already available in a
              two-qubit system. Perhaps the same principle could be applied to unlock
              more performance in other existing circuits”, said Fasciati.


              Achieving this world-leading combination of high-fidelity and fast 2Q
              gates validates the ongoing progress of superconducting qubits towards
              improving the accuracy, reliability and speed of quantum computations.


              The next challenge is then to apply these academic research advances
              at scale. Conventionally, 2D circuits require increasingly intricate
              engineering to route control wiring across the chip to the qubit which
              degrades the quality of the qubits, and can increase engineering errors.
              Similarly, a key challenge of superconducting circuits for quantum computation
              is the ability to scale qubit numbers whilst maintaining qubit quality
              and control in order to reach a commercially useful level of processing
              power.


              The latest work builds on the simplicity of the ‘coaxmon’ architecture
              — one of the world’s simplest three-dimensional quantum architectures
              that bring key componentry off-chip which enables improved flexibility,
              engineerability, and scalability. This patented technology is already
              being used in commercial environments by OQC. Further developing the
              coaxmon, the new work demonstrates the key properties of superconducting
              qubits required for reliable quantum computing, without adding the additional
              hardware complexity that is usually required for suppressing the  ZZ
              error. A patent has been filed by the Oxford research team on the technique
              for realising the opposite anharmonicity required for this fast gate
              and error suppression.


              OQC has expertise in building on academic breakthroughs with further
              research and engineering, to advance next-generation quantum computers.
              For example, OQC advanced previous Leek Lab research on cross-resonance
              2Q gates, engineering the gates to achieve significantly higher fidelities
              on larger scales, now used across OQC devices. The 2Q gate results therefore
              serve as a proof-of-concept demonstrator for further development and
              optimisation in OQC’s coaxmon-based devices. This means that the new
              research can be directly put towards achieving the hardware metrics
              needed for commercially useful quantum computers.

              # Breakthrough may clear major hurdle for quantum computers


              The potential of quantum computers is currently hindered by a significant
              trade-off. Quantum systems capable of performing complex operations
              tend to be less tolerant to errors and noise, while those more resistant
              to noise are harder and slower to compute with.


              - [Quantum Tech](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/products/quantum/)


              18 June 2024


              [byEditor](https://www.electronicspecifier.com/author/eseditor/)


              A research team from Chalmers University of Technology has now developed
              a unique system that addresses this dilemma, paving the way for longer
              computation times and more robust quantum computers.


              For quantum computers to make a real impact in society, researchers
              must first overcome major challenges. Errors and noise from sources
              such as electromagnetic interference or magnetic fluctuations cause
              sensitive qubits to lose their quantum states, limiting their ability
              to continue calculations. Consequently, the duration for which a quantum
              computer can work on a problem is currently constrained. Moreover, for
              a quantum computer to tackle complex problems, researchers must find
              a way to control quantum states. Like a car without a steering wheel,
              quantum states are somewhat useless without an efficient control system.


              The research field faces a trade-off: systems that allow for efficient
              error correction and longer computation times are less capable of controlling
              quantum states, and vice versa. However, the Chalmers University of
              Technology research team has managed to find a way to combat this dilemma,
              marking a significant advancement in the quest for practical and effective
              quantum computing.


              “We have created a system that enables extremely complex operations
              on a multi-state quantum system, at an unprecedented speed,” says Simone
              Gasparinetti, leader of the 202Q-lab at Chalmers University of Technology
              and senior author of the study.


              While the building blocks of classical computers, bits, have either
              the value 1 or 0, the fundamental units of quantum computers, qubits,
              can exist in a superposition, holding both values simultaneously in
              any combination. This phenomenon, called superposition, allows quantum
              computers to perform simultaneous calculations, resulting in immense
              computing potential.


              However, qubits encoded in physical systems are extremely sensitive
              to errors, prompting researchers to find methods to detect and correct
              these errors. The system developed by the Chalmers researchers is based
              on continuous-variable quantum computing and uses harmonic oscillators
              to encode information linearly. These oscillators consist of thin strips
              of superconducting material patterned on an insulating substrate to
              form microwave resonators, a technology compatible with the most advanced
              superconducting quantum computers. This method, known in the field,
              departs from the two-quantum state principle by offering a larger number
              of physical quantum states, thereby enhancing the resilience of quantum
              computers against errors and noise.


              “Think of a qubit as a blue lamp that, quantum mechanically, can be
              both switched on and off simultaneously. In contrast, a continuous variable
              quantum system is like an infinite rainbow, offering a seamless gradient
              of colours. This illustrates its ability to access a vast number of
              states, providing far richer possibilities than the qubit’s two states,”
              says Axel Eriksson, researcher in quantum technology at Chalmers University
              of Technology and lead author of the study.


              Although continuous-variable quantum computing using harmonic oscillators
              enhances error correction, its linear nature does not support complex
              operations. Previous attempts to integrate harmonic oscillators with
              control systems like superconducting quantum systems have been thwarted
              by the Kerr effect, which scrambles the many quantum states of the oscillator,
              negating the intended benefits.


              The Chalmers researchers overcame this by placing a control system device
              inside the oscillator, effectively circumventing the Kerr effect and
              addressing the trade-off problem. This innovative system preserves the
              advantages of harmonic oscillators, such as a resource-efficient path
              towards fault tolerance, while allowing precise control of quantum states
              at high speed. Detailed in an article published in Nature Communications,
              this breakthrough may pave the way for more robust quantum computers.


              “Our community has often tried to keep superconducting elements away
              from quantum oscillators, not to scramble the fragile quantum states.
              In this work, we have challenged this paradigm. By embedding a controlling
              device at the heart of the oscillator we were able to avoid scrambling
              the many quantum states while at the same time being able to control
              and manipulate them. As a result, we demonstrated a novel set of gate
              operations performed at very high speed,” says Simone Gasparinetti.


              _Image caption: The circuit diagram to the left illustrates how the
              Chalmers researcher team was able to turn on and off different operations
              by sending microwave pulses (wiggly arrow) to the control system embedded
              in the oscillator. The researchers used the system to generate a so-called
              cubic phase state which is a quantum resource for quantum error correction.

              _Last updated: June 12, 2025_


              Today I’m delighted to announce Willow, our latest quantum chip. Willow
              has state-of-the-art performance across a number of metrics, enabling
              two major achievements.


              - The first is that Willow can reduce errors exponentially as we scale
              up using _more_ qubits. This cracks a key challenge in quantum error
              correction that the field has pursued for almost 30 years.

              - Second, Willow performed a standard benchmark computation in under
              five minutes that would take one of today’s [fastest supercomputers](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/)
              10 septillion (that is, 1025) years — a number that vastly exceeds the
              age of the Universe.


              The Willow chip is a major step on a journey that began over 10 years
              ago. When I founded Google Quantum AI in 2012, the vision was to build
              a useful, large-scale quantum computer that could harness quantum mechanics
              — the “operating system” of nature to the extent we know it today —
              to benefit society by advancing scientific discovery, developing [helpful
              applications](https://quantumai.google/applications), and tackling some
              of society''s greatest challenges. As part of Google Research, our team
              has charted a long-term [roadmap](https://quantumai.google/roadmap),
              and Willow moves us significantly along that path towards commercially
              relevant applications.


              ## Exponential quantum error correction — below threshold!


              Errors are one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing, since
              qubits, the units of computation in quantum computers, have a tendency
              to rapidly exchange information with their environment, making it difficult
              to protect the information needed to complete a computation. Typically
              the more qubits you use, the more errors will occur, and the system
              becomes classical.


              Today in [Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y),
              we published results showing that [**the more qubits we use in Willow,
              the more we** **_reduce_** **errors**](https://research.google/blog/making-quantum-error-correction-work/)
              **, and the more quantum the system becomes**. We tested ever-larger
              arrays of physical qubits, scaling up from a grid of 3x3 encoded qubits,
              to a grid of 5x5, to a grid of 7x7 — and each time, using our latest
              advances in quantum error correction, we were able to cut the error
              rate in half. In other words, we achieved an exponential reduction in
              the error rate. This historic accomplishment is known in the field as
              “below threshold” — being able to drive errors down while scaling up
              the number of qubits. You must demonstrate being below threshold to
              show real progress on error correction, and this has been an outstanding
              challenge since [quantum error correction](https://journals.aps.org/pra/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevA.52.R2493)
              was introduced by Peter Shor in 1995.


              There are other scientific “firsts” involved in this result as well.
              For example, it’s also one of the first compelling examples of real-time
              error correction on a superconducting quantum system — crucial for any
              useful computation, because if you can’t correct errors fast enough,
              they ruin your computation before it’s done. And it’s a "beyond breakeven"
              demonstration, where our arrays of qubits have longer lifetimes than
              the individual physical qubits do, an unfakable sign that error correction
              is improving the system overall.


              As the first system below threshold, this is the most convincing prototype
              for a scalable logical qubit built to date. It’s a strong sign that
              useful, very large quantum computers can indeed be built. Willow brings
              us closer to running practical, commercially-relevant algorithms that
              can’t be replicated on conventional computers.


              ## 10 septillion years on one of today’s fastest supercomputers


              As a measure of Willow’s performance, we used the [random circuit sampling
              (RCS) benchmark](https://research.google/blog/validating-random-circuit-sampling-as-a-benchmark-for-measuring-quantum-progress/).
              Pioneered by our team and now widely used as a standard in the field,
              RCS is the classically hardest benchmark that can be done on a quantum
              computer today. You can think of this as an entry point for quantum
              computing — it checks whether a quantum computer is doing something
              that couldn’t be done on a classical computer. Any team building a quantum
              computer should check first if it can beat classical computers on RCS;
              otherwise there is strong reason for skepticism that it can tackle more
              complex quantum tasks. We’ve consistently used this benchmark to assess
              progress from one generation of chip to the next — we reported Sycamore
              results in [October 2019](https://blog.google/technology/ai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means/)
              and again recently in [October 2024](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-07998-6).


              Willow’s performance on this benchmark is astonishing: It performed
              a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s [fastest
              supercomputers](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/) 1025 or 10 septillion
              years. If you want to write it out, it’s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000
              years. This mind-boggling number exceeds known timescales in physics
              and vastly exceeds the age of the universe. It lends credence to the
              notion that quantum computation occurs in many parallel universes, in
              line with the idea that we live in a multiverse, a [prediction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fabric_of_Reality)
              first made by David Deutsch.


              These latest results for Willow, as shown in the plot below, are our
              best so far, but we’ll continue to make progress.


              Computational costs are heavily influenced by available memory. Our
              estimates therefore consider a range of scenarios, from an ideal situation
              with unlimited memory (▲) to a more practical, embarrassingly parallelizable
              implementation on GPUs (⬤).


              Our assessment of how Willow outpaces one of the world’s most powerful
              classical supercomputers, [Frontier](https://www.olcf.ornl.gov/frontier/),
              was based on conservative assumptions. For example, we assumed full
              access to secondary storage, i.e., hard drives, without any bandwidth
              overhead — a generous and unrealistic allowance for Frontier. Of course,
              as happened after we announced the first [beyond-classical computation
              in 2019](https://blog.google/technology/ai/what-our-quantum-computing-milestone-means/),
              we expect classical computers to keep improving on this benchmark, but
              the rapidly growing gap shows that quantum processors are peeling away
              at a double exponential rate and will continue to vastly outperform
              classical computers as we scale up.


              ## State-of-the-art performance


              Willow was fabricated in our new, state-of-the-art fabrication facility
              in Santa Barbara — one of only a few facilities in the world built from
              the ground up for this purpose. System engineering is key when designing
              and fabricating quantum chips: All components of a chip, such as single
              and two-qubit gates, qubit reset, and readout, have to be simultaneously
              well engineered and integrated. If any component lags or if two components
              don''t function well together, it drags down system performance. Therefore,
              maximizing system performance informs all aspects of our process, from
              chip architecture and fabrication to gate development and calibration.
              The achievements we report assess quantum computing systems holistically,
              not just one factor at a time.


              We’re focusing on quality, not just quantity — because just producing
              larger numbers of qubits doesn’t help if they’re not high enough quality.
              With 105 qubits, Willow now has best-in-class performance across the
              two system benchmarks discussed above: quantum error correction and
              random circuit sampling. Such algorithmic benchmarks are the best way
              to measure overall chip performance. Other more specific performance
              metrics are also important; for example, our T1 times, which measure
              how long qubits can retain an excitation — the key quantum computational
              resource — are now approaching 100 µs (microseconds). This is an impressive
              ~5x improvement over our previous generation of chips. If you want to
              evaluate quantum hardware and compare across platforms, here is a table
              of key specifications:


              Willow’s performance across a number of metrics.


              ## What’s next with Willow and beyond


              The next challenge for the field is to demonstrate a first "useful,
              beyond-classical" computation on today''s quantum chips that is relevant
              to a real-world application. We’re optimistic that the Willow generation
              of chips can help us achieve this goal. So far, there have been two
              separate types of experiments. On the one hand, we’ve run the RCS benchmark,
              which measures performance against classical computers but has no known
              real-world applications. On the other hand, we’ve done scientifically
              interesting simulations of quantum systems, which have led to new scientific
              discoveries but are still within the reach of classical computers. Our
              goal is to do both at the same time — to step into the realm of algorithms
              that are beyond the reach of classical computers **and** that are useful
              for real-world, commercially relevant problems.


              Random circuit sampling (RCS), while extremely challenging for classical
              computers, has yet to demonstrate practical commercial applications.


              We invite researchers, engineers, and developers to join us on this
              journey by checking out our [open source software](https://quantumai.google/software)
              and educational resources, including our [new course on Coursera](https://coursera.org/learn/quantum-error-correction),
              where developers can learn the essentials of quantum error correction
              and help us create algorithms that can solve the problems of the future.


              My colleagues sometimes ask me why I left the burgeoning field of AI
              to focus on quantum computing. My answer is that both will prove to
              be the most transformational technologies of our time, but advanced
              AI will significantly benefit from access to quantum computing. This
              is why I named our lab Quantum AI. Quantum algorithms have fundamental
              scaling laws on their side, as we’re seeing with RCS. There are similar
              scaling advantages for many foundational computational tasks that are
              essential for AI. So quantum computation will be indispensable for collecting
              training data that’s inaccessible to classical machines, training and
              optimizing certain learning architectures, and modeling systems where
              quantum effects are important. This includes helping us discover new
              medicines, designing more efficient batteries for electric cars, and
              accelerating progress in fusion and new energy alternatives. Many of
              these future game-changing applications won’t be feasible on classical
              computers; they’re waiting to be unlocked with quantum computing.

              Look inside Quantinuum''s quantum computer.


              [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/news/news#press-release)


              Colorado-based Quantinuum has set a new record in quantum computing
              by successfully entangling 50 logical qubits.


              The company’s Director of Computational Theory and Design, David Hayes,
              revealed this achievement at a plenary session of the Q2B conference
              held at Silicon Valley earlier this week.


              The race to build quantum computers that will replace the fastest supercomputers
              of the day is heating up, and companies are pumping billions of dollars
              to reach their first. But for quantum computers to be deployed in the
              real world, we must first apply error corrections to their computations.


              All computers are prone to errors in their computations. With silicon-based
              computers, we have developed error correction strategies that perform
              the job well. However, the nature of quantum computers makes replicating
              these correction approaches to quantum computers impossible, and new
              approaches need to be developed.


              In addition to the quantum bits or qubits, researchers are interested
              in developing logical qubits to advance quantum computing.


              ## Why logical qubits?


              Logical qubits are groups of physical qubits that run quantum computations
              using specifications of a quantum algorithm. Researchers are deploying
              logical qubits to reduce error rates in quantum computations. Since
              different technologies are used for qubits, building and using [logical
              qubits](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/microsoft-unveils-path-to-more-reliable-quantum-computers)
              have varied approaches, too.


              Earlier this year, Google’s quantum computing division demonstrated
              a method that can make a single logical qubit which is large and becomes
              more error-proof as its size increases. The other approach involves
              using a smaller number of qubits to make a larger number of logical
              qubits, providing a better check on error correction.


              When more logical qubits are deployed, entangling them is crucial to
              get a coherent output, and this is where Quantinuum made a major leap.

              ## Entangling logical qubits


              Last month, Microsoft and Atom Computing set a record demonstrating
              the entanglement of 24 logical qubits. With the recent announcement
              of entangling 50 logical qubits, Quantinuum has more than doubled that
              number and broken two records in the process.


              The first is for the largest number of entangled logical qubits, putting
              a fair distance between their achievement and Atom Computing. The second
              and more important one is setting up a computer with the largest number
              of logical qubits to date.


              Interesting Engineering has previously reported how companies are building
              computers with [1,000 qubits](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/ibm-1000-qubit-processor)
              and even more. However, a large number of qubits is irrelevant if its
              output cannot be error-corrected, and this is where the number of logical
              qubits is important.


              Another QuEra Computing, along with Harvard University, had set this
              record with [48 logical qubits](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/us-error-free-computing-breakthrough)
              in 2023, and Quantinuum has marginally beat this record. Quantinuum’s
              Hayes was also quick to point out that the large number of logical qubits
              in their setup could only detect errors and not correct them.


              So, although the company has set a record, the achievement will not
              necessarily turn into a fault-tolerant quantum computer anytime soon.
              Instead, it is now poised at an intermediate level step where it can
              detect the errors but isn’t correcting them.


              According to [Hayes presentation](https://www.quantinuum.com/blog/q2b-2024-advancements-in-logical-quantum-computation),
              the company’s achievement only provides one of the three high-level
              requirements for industrial-scale quantum computers. Quantinuum is developing
              capable hardware for quantum computers. Robust software that can control
              and optimize quantum computer performance and co-develop hardware and
              software to meet specific application needs are the other pieces of
              the puzzle that still need to be solved before a quantum computer becomes
              a reality.

              Quantinuum has achieved a significant breakthrough in quantum computing
              by creating the largest-ever GHZ state with fifty entangled logical
              qubits, shattering all existing records. This milestone was announced
              by Dr. David Hayes, Director of Computational Theory and Design at Quantinuum,
              who will unveil details of this achievement during a plenary session.


              Creating a fifty-qubit GHZ state with logical qubits demonstrates the
              company’s leadership in developing fault-tolerant quantum computers,
              a crucial requirement for industry-scale quantum computation. According
              to Dr. Hayes, three key elements for advancing quantum computing are
              high-performance hardware, robust software, and collaboration with partners
              to optimize error correction for specific applications. Quantinuum’s
              achievement signals significant progress in the field and is expected
              to accelerate the development of practical applications for quantum
              technology.


              ## Introduction to Quantum Computing and GHZ States


              Quantum computing is a rapidly advancing field that has the potential
              to revolutionize various aspects of modern technology. One of the key
              concepts in quantum computing is the creation of entangled states, such
              as the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state. The GHZ state is a type
              of entangled state that involves multiple qubits, which are the fundamental
              units of quantum information. In recent years, significant progress
              has been made in creating large-scale GHZ states using logical qubits.
              Logical qubits are a type of qubit that is designed to be more robust
              against errors and can be used to create larger-scale entangled states.


              The creation of large-scale GHZ states is an important milestone in
              the development of quantum computing, as it demonstrates the ability
              to control and manipulate multiple qubits in a coherent manner. This
              has significant implications for the development of fault-tolerant quantum
              computers, which are essential for large-scale quantum computation.
              Fault-tolerant quantum computers require the ability to correct errors
              that occur during computation, and the creation of large-scale GHZ states
              is an important step towards achieving this goal.


              The recent achievement of creating a 50-qubit GHZ state using logical
              qubits is a significant breakthrough in the field of quantum computing.
              This achievement demonstrates the ability to create large-scale entangled
              states with high fidelity, which is essential for the development of
              practical quantum computers. The use of logical qubits in this achievement
              is particularly notable, as it highlights the potential of these qubits
              for creating robust and scalable entangled states.


              The creation of large-scale GHZ states has significant implications
              for the development of quantum computing applications. For example,
              GHZ states can be used to create secure communication channels, such
              as quantum key distribution protocols. Additionally, GHZ states can
              be used to simulate complex quantum systems, which could lead to breakthroughs
              in fields such as chemistry and materials science.


              ## [Quantum Error Correction](https://quantumzeitgeist.com/quantum-error-correction-quantum-computing/)
              and [Logical Qubits](https://quantumzeitgeist.com/microsoft-and-quantinuum-create-12-highly-reliable-logical-qubits/)


              Quantum error correction is a critical component of fault-tolerant quantum
              computing. Quantum errors occur when the state of a qubit is altered
              due to interactions with the environment or other qubits. These errors
              can quickly accumulate and destroy the fragile states required for quantum
              computation. To mitigate these errors, quantum error correction techniques
              are used to detect and correct errors in real-time.


              Logical qubits are a type of qubit that is designed to be more robust
              against errors. Logical qubits are created by encoding multiple physical
              qubits into a single logical qubit. This encoding process allows for
              the detection and correction of errors, which can significantly improve
              the fidelity of quantum computation. The use of logical qubits in the
              creation of large-scale GHZ states is particularly notable, as it highlights
              the potential of these qubits for creating robust and scalable entangled
              states.


              The development of quantum error correction techniques is an active
              area of research, with various approaches being explored. One approach
              is to use surface codes, which involve encoding qubits into a two-dimensional
              array of physical qubits. Another approach is to use concatenated codes,
              which involve encoding qubits into multiple layers of physical qubits.
              The choice of quantum error correction technique depends on the specific
              application and the requirements of the quantum computer.


              The creation of large-scale GHZ states using logical qubits demonstrates
              the potential of these qubits for creating robust and scalable entangled
              states. This achievement highlights the importance of quantum error
              correction in the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers. By
              using logical qubits, researchers can create larger-scale entangled
              states with higher fidelity, which is essential for the development
              of practical quantum computers.


              ## Requirements for Industry-Scale Quantum Computation


              The development of industry-scale quantum computation requires several
              key components. First, high-performance hardware is required to create
              and manipulate large-scale entangled states. This includes the development
              of robust and scalable qubits, as well as advanced control systems for
              manipulating these qubits. Second, robust software is required to control
              and optimize the performance of the quantum computer. This includes
              the development of sophisticated algorithms and software frameworks
              for simulating and optimizing quantum computation.


              Third, co-development with partners is essential for optimizing hardware
              and error correction for specific applications. This involves collaborating
              with industry partners to develop customized quantum computers that
              meet the specific needs of their applications. By working together,
              researchers and industry partners can identify the key challenges and
              opportunities in developing practical quantum computers.


              The development of industry-scale quantum computation also requires
              significant advances in materials science and engineering. For example,
              the development of robust and scalable qubits requires the creation
              of high-quality materials with precise control over their properties.
              Additionally, the development of advanced control systems for manipulating
              qubits requires significant advances in fields such as microwave engineering
              and cryogenics.


              The recent achievement of creating a 50-qubit GHZ state using logical
              qubits demonstrates the potential of these qubits for creating robust
              and scalable entangled states. This achievement highlights the importance
              of quantum error correction in the development of fault-tolerant quantum
              computers. By using logical qubits, researchers can create larger-scale
              entangled states with higher fidelity, which is essential for the development
              of practical quantum computers.


              ## Implications for Quantum Computing Applications


              The creation of large-scale GHZ states has significant implications
              for the development of quantum computing applications. For example,
              GHZ states can be used to create secure communication channels, such
              as quantum key distribution protocols. Additionally, GHZ states can
              be used to simulate complex quantum systems, which could lead to breakthroughs
              in fields such as chemistry and materials science.


              The development of practical quantum computers also has significant
              implications for fields such as optimization and machine learning. Quantum
              computers can solve complex optimization problems that are currently
              unsolvable using classical computers. Additionally, quantum computers
              can speed up machine learning algorithms, which could lead to breakthroughs
              in fields such as image recognition and natural language processing.


              The recent achievement of creating a 50-qubit GHZ state using logical
              qubits demonstrates the potential of these qubits for creating robust
              and scalable entangled states. This achievement highlights the importance
              of quantum error correction in the development of fault-tolerant quantum
              computers. By using logical qubits, researchers can create larger-scale
              entangled states with higher fidelity, which is essential for the development
              of practical quantum computers.


              The creation of large-scale GHZ states also has significant implications
              for the development of quantum computing hardware. For example, the
              development of robust and scalable qubits requires the creation of high-quality
              materials with precise control over their properties. Additionally,
              the development of advanced control systems for manipulating qubits
              requires significant advances in fields such as microwave engineering
              and cryogenics.

              Google’s latest project marks a major milestone in quantum computing.


              On Monday, the corporation unveiled a new chip, dubbed Willow, that
              could prove pivotal to the development and potential large-scale use
              of the field. One of the new tech’s neatest tricks is that it needs
              just five minutes to solve a problem that would take the world’s most
              powerful supercomputers 10 septillion, or 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,
              years to complete, [a report](https://blog.google/technology/research/google-willow-quantum-chip/)
              from Hartmut Neven, the founder and lead of Google’s Quantum AI division,
              says. That’s older than the universe, according to [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/09/technology/google-quantum-computing.html).

              For the unversed, quantum computing is rather different from the kind
              of tech that operates today’s laptops and smartphones, the BBC [reports.](https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c791ng0zvl3o)
              Rather than processing information with every bit represented by either
              a 1 or 0, quantum computers use (rather fittingly) quantum mechanics,
              a field of physics that studies subatomic particles, to operate. Because
              of this, quantum computers can solve problems much faster than traditional
              computers—and may even be able to solve issues that present-day tech
              can’t solve at all.

              Though Willow and quantum computing in general remain largely theoretical
              in their applications, Nevens believes the field’s uses are innumerable.
              “\[Quantum computing is\] relevant when it comes to the design of nuclear
              fusion reactors to understand the functioning of drugs and pharmaceutical
              development, it would be relevant for developing better car batteries
              and another long list of such tasks,” the founder told the BBC.


              One of the field’s main problems is the amount of errors that occur
              as more qubits (a.k.a. the basic information unit of quantum computing)
              are processed. Willow overcame that obstacle, however; it exponentially
              lowered mistakes as the amount of qubits increased, another major achievement
              of the tech. What makes the breakthrough even more impressive is that
              it took scientists some 30 years to complete the feat, Nevens says.


              Google notes that to develop practically useful quantum computers, though,
              the error rate must be much lower that what Willow can currently produce,
              the BBC reports. So it could be some time (as well as billions of dollars
              of investment) before we see quantum computers become a reality—but
              nowhere near 10 septillion years, with any luck.

              Computer, Breaking Key Benchmark Record**


              ## Quantinuum and JPMorgan Chase achieved a 100x improvement over the
              existing industry benchmark using Quantinuum’s H2-1 quantum computer


              June 5, 2024


              **Broomfield, Colorado and London, UK, June 5th, 2024** **—** [Quantinuum](https://www.quantinuum.com/),
              the world’s largest integrated quantum computing company, today unveiled
              the industry’s first quantum computer with 56 trapped-ion qubits. H2-1
              has further enhanced its market-leading fidelity and is now impossible
              for a classical computer to fully simulate.


              A joint team from Quantinuum and JPMorgan Chase ran a Random Circuit
              Sampling (RCS) algorithm, achieving a remarkable 100x improvement over
              [prior industry results](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5)
              from Google in 2019 and setting a new world record for the cross entropy
              benchmark. H2-1’s combination of scale and hardware fidelity makes it
              difficult for today’s most powerful supercomputers and other quantum
              computing architectures to match this result.


              “We’re extending our lead in the race towards fault tolerant quantum
              computing, accelerating research for customers like JPMorgan Chase in
              ways that aren’t possible with any other technology,” said **Rajeeb
              Hazra, CEO of Quantinuum.** “Our focus on quality of qubits versus quantity
              of qubits is changing what’s possible, and bringing us closer to the
              long-awaited commercialization of quantum’s applications across industries
              like finance, logistics, transportation and chemistry.”


              Quantinuum’s analysis also indicates that the H2-1 executes RCS at 56
              qubits with an estimated 30,000x reduction in power consumption compared
              to classical supercomputers, reinforcing it as the preferred solution
              for a wide array of computational challenges.


              “The fidelity achieved in our random circuit sampling experiment shows
              unprecedented system-level performance of the Quantinuum quantum computer.
              We are excited to leverage this high fidelity to advance the field of
              quantum algorithms for industrial use cases broadly, and financial use
              cases in particular,” said **Marco Pistoia, Head of Global Technology
              Applied Research at JPMorgan Chase.**


              Today’s announcement is the latest in a string of breakthroughs made
              by Quantinuum in 2024:


              - In March, the company [revealed](https://www.quantinuum.com/news/quantinuum-proves-their-quantum-computers-will-scale-with-major-hardware-innovation)
              a long-sought solution to the “wiring problem”, demonstrating that the
              quantum charge-coupled device (QCCD) architecture can scale to large
              qubit numbers.

              - Quantinuum’s H-Series became the [first to achieve](https://www.quantinuum.com/news/quantinuum-extends-its-significant-lead-in-quantum-computing-achieving-historic-milestones-for-hardware-fidelity-and-quantum-volume)
              “three 9s” – 99.9% – two-qubit gate fidelity across all qubit pairs
              in a production device, a critical milestone enabling fault-tolerance.

              - Then, in [collaboration](https://www.quantinuum.com/news/quantinuum-and-microsoft-announce-new-era-in-quantum-computing-with-breakthrough-demonstration-of-reliable-qubits)
              with Microsoft, Quantinuum ’s H2-1 was declared the first – and so far
              the only – quantum computer capable of achieving [Level 2 Resilient
              quantum computing](https://www.quantinuum.com/news/quantinuum-and-microsoft-announce-new-era-in-quantum-computing-with-breakthrough-demonstration-of-reliable-qubits),
              creating four reliable logical qubits using error correction and detection
              to achieve an 800-fold reduction in error rate.


              “Microsoft looks forward to a continued collaboration with Quantinuum
              as they release their high fidelity 56-qubit machine,” **said Dennis
              Tom, General Manager Microsoft Azure Quantum.** “Recently, the teams
              created four highly reliable logical qubits by applying Azure Quantum''s
              qubit-virtualization system to Quantinuum''s 32-qubit machine. With
              the additional physical qubits available on Quantinuum''s new machine,
              we anticipate creating more logical qubits with even lower error rates.
              As we reach these milestones, we will continue to increase the resiliency
              of quantum operations as well as the utility of quantum computing.”


              Quantinuum also [recently closed a $300 million equity fundraise](https://www.honeywell.com/us/en/press/2024/01/honeywell-announces-the-closing-of-300-million-equity-investment-round-for-quantinuum-at-5-billion-pre-money-valuation)
              anchored by JPMorgan Chase with additional participation from Mitsui
              & Co., Amgen and Honeywell, which remains the company’s majority shareholder,

          - title: Professor Achieves Major Quantum Computing Breakthrough

              Quantum computers have to be kept cold to function — very cold. These
              machines generally run at “just a few degrees above absolute zero,”
              says [Yoseob Yoon](https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/yoon-yoseob/),
              assistant professor of mechanical and industrial engineering at Northeastern
              University. “It’s colder than outer space.”


              Yoon’s research focuses on “controlling material properties using lasers,”
              he says.


              In other words, he shoots light at atomically thin materials to get
              them moving in novel ways.


              One of his principal materials is something called graphene, a two-dimensional
              surface whose discoverers received the [Nobel Prize in Physics in 2010](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2010/summary/),
              Yoon says.

              University.


              Yoon produces graphene through what he calls the Scotch Tape method.
              “We use a few millimeter-wide and -thick bulk materials of, for example,
              graphite,” he says, the same carbon derivative found in pencils. “We
              basically use Scotch Tape — literally — to peel off” ultra-thin samples
              from the bulk material.


              These samples are the thickness of a single atom, “smoother than most
              other materials,” he says.


              There already existed a field studying “thermal transport using thin
              metallic films,” Yoon says. By firing lasers at very thin metals, researchers
              can induce controlled oscillations like acoustic waves in drums.


              However, “this has been limited to gigahertz regimes, because these
              metals are very heavy, and they cannot be controlled down to monolayer
              thickness.


              “And then there is another field, basically a 2D-material field,” he
              continues. “They exfoliate these atomically thin layers.”


              Yoon’s breakthrough came in combining these two fields. By aligning
              atomically thin structures with the study of laser-based thermal transport,
              “there’s a new regime that we couldn’t achieve before.”

              Now, in [a new paper](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07604-9) published
              in Nature, Yoon and his collaborators have identified novel van der
              Waals heterostructures (created by combining layers of these atomically
              thin materials, including graphene and other varieties) that allow control
              at terahertz frequencies.


              Here’s what that means. Yoon notes that “temperature” is really just
              atoms in motion. The faster the atoms move, the higher the temperature.
              In a quantum computer, this motion translates to random noise, inhibiting
              the computer’s function. Cooling a quantum computer, therefore, increases
              controllability.


              Current transducers in quantum computers are limited to the gigahertz
              range. “That limits the range of temperatures that can be operated,”
              Yoon says. “They can operate only at low temperatures.” Colder than
              outer space, remember.


              “Because of this frequency limit,” he continues, increasing the range
              of these transducers into terahertz frequencies — an increase by a factor
              of a thousand — “we will be able to run \[quantum computers\] at room
              temperatures.”


              In other words, a machine that runs close to negative 460 degrees Fahrenheit
              can suddenly be run at room temperature.


              At least this particular component, Yoon is quick to point out. “There
              are some disadvantages of going to higher temperatures, \[for instance,\]
              quantum signals will decay much faster.”


              So this isn’t the ultimate solution in room temperature quantum computing,
              but it is one major step toward that goal. Additionally, this “discovery
              also allows for the design of more efficient heat management components
              in classical computers,” he wrote in a follow-up.


              What comes next? “We’ve pushed in terms of frequency bandwidth, and
              how high the frequency can be,” he says. “But we didn’t push to the
              amplitude limits.”


              “We want to push the limit.”

              **Researchers have achieved high gate fidelities up to 99.98% using
              a new double-transmon coupler. This development enhances quantum computing
              performance and supports the advancement toward fault-tolerant systems.**


              Researchers from the RIKEN Center for Quantum Computing and Toshiba
              have developed a quantum computer gate using a double-transmon coupler
              (DTC), a device previously proposed in theory to enhance the fidelity
              of quantum gates significantly. With this innovation, the team achieved
              a fidelity of 99.92% for a two-qubit device known as a CZ gate and 99.98%
              for a single-qubit gate.


              This milestone, part of the Q-LEAP project, not only improves the performance
              of noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices but also lays the
              groundwork for fault-tolerant quantum computation through more effective
              error correction.


              #### Enhanced Gate Fidelity With DTC


              The DTC is a novel tunable coupler comprising two fixed-frequency transmons—a
              type of qubit designed to be less sensitive to noise caused by charge—connected
              through a loop containing an additional Josephson junction. This architecture
              addresses a critical challenge in quantum computing: achieving high-fidelity
              connections between qubits. High fidelity is crucial for reducing errors
              and increasing the reliability of quantum computations.


              The DTC stands out by minimizing residual interactions while enabling
              fast, high-fidelity two-qubit gate operations, even for qubits with
              significant frequency differences (detuning). While single-qubit gates
              have reached fidelity levels of 99.9%, two-qubit gates have typically
              had error rates of 1% or more, primarily due to unwanted qubit interactions,
              such as the ZZ interaction. The DTC approach directly tackles these
              issues, representing a major advance in quantum gate technology.

              panels at the bottom are magnified pictures of the areas (dotted rectangles)
              containing Josephson junctions. Credit: RIKEN


              #### Optimizing Quantum Error Correction


              A key of the current work, published in _Physical Review X_, is the
              construction of a gate using state-of-the-art fabrication techniques
              using a type of machine learning known as reinforcement learning. This
              approach allowed the researchers to translate the theoretical potential
              of the DTC into practical application. They used this approach to achieve
              a balance between two types of remaining error—leakage error and decoherence
              error—that remained within the system, selecting a length of 48 nanoseconds
              as an optimal compromise between the two error sources. Thanks to this,
              they were able to achieve fidelity levels that are among the highest
              reported in the field.


              #### Future Prospects in Quantum Technology


              According to Yasunobu Nakamura, director of the RIKEN Center for Quantum
              Computing, “By reducing the error rates in quantum gates, we have made
              more reliable and accurate quantum computations possible. This is particularly
              important for the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers, which
              are the future of quantum computing.”


              He continues, “This device’s ability to perform effectively with highly
              detuned qubits makes it a versatile and competitive building block for
              various quantum computing architectures. This adaptability ensures that
              it can be integrated into existing and future superconducting quantum
              processors, enhancing their overall performance and scalability. In
              the future, we plan to try to achieve a shorter gate length, as this
              could help minimize the incoherent error.”

          answer: 'Quantum supremacy is the point at which a quantum computer can
            perform a task that is impossible or impractical for a classical computer
            to do because it would take too long to be useful ([Howtogeek](https://www.howtogeek.com/quantum-supremacy-what-is-it-and-why-do-we-want-it/)).
            It is achieved when a quantum computer can solve problems that are impractical
            for classical computers due to time constraints ([Howtogeek](https://www.howtogeek.com/quantum-supremacy-what-is-it-and-why-do-we-want-it/)).
            The concept showcases the unique resources of quantum computers, such
            as direct access to entanglement and superposition ([IBM](https://www.ibm.com/quantum/blog/on-quantum-supremacy)).
