        published_date: N/A
        text: "In our latest work, “Stable Quantum-Correlated Many Body States via\
          \ Engineered Dissipation”, published in Science, we explore a counterintuitive\
          \ effect of environmental dissipation which is often viewed as harmful to\
          \ quantum computing. By carefully engineering dissipation, a new scalable\
          \ protocol for preparing entangled many-body quantum states with lifetimes\
          \ longer than physical qubits was discovered. \n \n \n \n A quantum computer\
          \ can solve certain problems exponentially faster than a classical computer.\
          \ However, current realizations of its building blocks, qubits, are plagued\
          \ by errors induced by uncontrolled interactions between quantum bits (or\
          \ qubits ) and the environment. Such interactions introduce dissipation\
          \ , which destroys quantum entanglement , a necessary resource in quantum\
          \ algorithms, and drives a quantum processor toward trivial, classical states.\
          \ This decoherence process introduces errors, corrupting the utility of\
          \ the quantum processor. As such, environmental dissipation is the main\
          \ limiting factor for the current-generation quantum processors. Paradoxically,\
          \ while uncontrolled dissipation is a bane of current quantum processors\
          \ , engineered dissipation — created with a carefully tailored environment\
          \ — may in fact aid a quantum processor by steering it into a desired entangled\
          \ state. In our latest work, “Stable Quantum-Correlated Many Body States\
          \ via Engineered Dissipation”, published in Science , we explore this counterintuitive\
          \ effect of engineered dissipation. Not only does this method offer a reliable\
          \ way to prepare a quantum state, but it also naturally stabilizes the state\
          \ so that it survives much longer than it would without the dissipation.\
          \ These experiments lay the groundwork for improved methods to prepare strongly\
          \ correlated states (which may be found in e.g. magnets) in a quantum processor,\
          \ which could help physicists learn about exotic quantum materials, such\
          \ as high-temperature superconductors, in the future. \n \n \n Background\
          \ Before a quantum processor can run an algorithm or simulation, all of\
          \ its qubits must be initialized into a known state. This process, known\
          \ as quantum state preparation, is often accomplished by applying quantum\
          \ operations that are coherent — that is, they do not induce any dissipation.\
          \ In this work, we instead couple the qubits to an environment that is tailored\
          \ in just the right way so that the qubits are steered to their desired\
          \ state through dissipation. To demonstrate how this works, we can look\
          \ at one of the simplest examples, where engineered dissipation is used\
          \ to “cool” a quantum system toward its lowest energy state, known as its\
          \ ground state. To accomplish this, we first connect the quantum system\
          \ to another, auxiliary quantum system. Next we can transfer excitations\
          \ from the system of interest to the auxiliary system, then remove the excitations\
          \ via engineered dissipation. The removal of excitations gradually drives\
          \ the system towards its entangled ground state (see illustration below).\
          \ \n \n \n \n In the past, some groups have prepared entangled states of\
          \ up to eight atoms with engineered dissipation. But more intricate, many-body\
          \ entangled states have been out of reach due to environmental decoherence\
          \ caused by other, undesirable dissipation channels. With our Sycamore processor\
          \ , we have developed fast reset capabilities that makes the desired engineered\
          \ dissipation dominant over unwanted dissipation channels. \n \n Experiment\
          \ In this work, we use 35 qubits of a 49-qubit Sycamore processor to emulate\
          \ magnetic spins , while the 14 remaining auxiliary qubits are used to mimic\
          \ the previously mentioned tailored environment. We found that over time,\
          \ this tailored environment imparts a cooling effect on the spin system\
          \ and steers it toward the entangled ground state of a quantum spin model\
          \ known as the transverse-field Ising model . In this model, an array of\
          \ spins are positioned on a lattice, with each either pointing “spin-up”\
          \ or “spin-down.” Neighboring spins interact with one another, and an external\
          \ magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the spin alignment. Depending\
          \ on the relative strengths between the spin interactions and the applied\
          \ magnetic field, the system can be ferromagnetic or paramagnetic . We demonstrate\
          \ the effect of cooling on the spins in this model through a series of experiments.\
          \ First, we set up a 1D system, where a chain of our “spin” qubits are connected\
          \ in a line. Throughout this chain, every few qubits are also connected\
          \ to auxiliaries that act as the dissipative environment (see figure below).\
          \ We found that as the cooling cycles progress, the system settles into\
          \ a correlated state that resembles the ground state of the 1D transverse-field\
          \ Ising model. We then connect our qubits in a two-dimensional lattice (with\
          \ auxiliaries dispersed throughout; see the middle panel below) to perform\
          \ a similar experiment in 2D. We find that, in this 2D system, we can create\
          \ antiferromagnetic correlations between the spins so that they anti-align\
          \ with their neighbors. \n \n \n \n \n When we apply techniques previously\
          \ developed to mitigate errors, we found that we could dissipatively prepare\
          \ ground states with fidelities of 90% for an 18-qubit system. This value\
          \ matches the highest achieved fidelities at comparable system sizes using\
          \ unitary circuits. We also demonstrated theoretically, in the same work,\
          \ that the dissipative state preparation protocol scales more favorably\
          \ vs. system size in terms of preserving state fidelity. These comparisons\
          \ highlight the promise of the dissipative approach. The cooling algorithm\
          \ is expected to be even more advantageous for more intricate correlated\
          \ states, because once the coupling to the tailored environment is engineered,\
          \ then you can just “set it and forget it.” The system naturally evolves\
          \ to the desired state and stays there as long as the dissipation is happening.\
          \ Finally, we demonstrated that engineered dissipation has applications\
          \ to non-equilibrium quantum phenomena beyond state preparation. Here we\
          \ use a 1D system of 26 qubits to emulate a Heisenberg spin chain , a paradigmatic\
          \ correlated system. We drive a current through the chain by periodically\
          \ resetting the spins of two auxiliary qubits at either end. We first studied\
          \ transferred magnetization , whose time dependence is observed to vary\
          \ strongly depending on the underlying parameters of the model, in agreement\
          \ with established theory (see below). At the so-called “isotropic point,”\
          \ where exact solutions of the model are unknown, the team discovered a\
          \ previously unknown phenomenon. At this point, we observed that the spin\
          \ current has a distinct power-law dependence with time, which indicates\
          \ a form of previously unknown, anomalous diffusion for this spin model.\
          \ This result highlights the increasing functionality of the quantum processor\
          \ as a tool for fundamental physics discovery, where the introduction of\
          \ engineered dissipation unveils quantum phenomena that have never been\
          \ observed or theoretically realized. \n \n \n \n \n Conclusion This work\
          \ shows that engineered dissipation strongly enhances the functionality\
          \ of quantum processors, allowing for a conceptually new approach to preparing\
          \ and probing quantum-correlated states. Engineered dissipation will aid\
          \ in the preparation of strongly correlated states, which give rise to new\
          \ quantum phases of matter that are found in materials such as magnets.\
          \ Quantum materials are considered among the most promising applications\
          \ of quantum processors, yet most other protocols for correlated state preparation\
          \ are severely limited by unwanted decoherence. We believe the methods demonstrated\
          \ here will also enable the preparation of intricate many-body states such\
          \ as quantum spin liquids, which may aid in the synthesis of high temperature\
          \ superconductors or new materials for data-storage. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\

      - title: Making quantum error correction work
        url: https://research.google/blog/making-quantum-error-correction-work/
        published_date: N/A
        text: "Quantum computers offer promising applications in many fields, ranging\
          \ from chemistry and drug discovery to optimization and cryptography . Most\
          \ of these applications require billions if not trillions of operations\
          \ to execute reliably — not much compared to what your web browser is doing\
          \ right now. But quantum information is delicate, and even state-of-the-art\
          \ quantum devices will typically experience at least one failure in every\
          \ thousand operations. To achieve their potential, performance needs to\
          \ improve dramatically. Today in “ Quantum error correction below the surface\
          \ code threshold ,” published in Nature , we report a qualitative change\
          \ in the way quantum computers perform. This change is powered by combining\
          \ quantum error correction with our latest superconducting quantum processor,\
          \ Willow . Willow is the first processor where error-corrected qubits get\
          \ exponentially better as they get bigger. Each time we increase our encoded\
          \ qubits from a 3x3 to a 5x5 to a 7x7 lattice of physical qubits, the encoded\
          \ error rate is suppressed by a factor of two. This demonstrates the exponential\
          \ error suppression promised by quantum error correction, a nearly 30-year-old\
          \ goal for quantum computing and the key element to unlocking large-scale\
          \ quantum applications. \n \n \n Error-corrected qubits that get better\
          \ as they get bigger To make quantum computers more reliable, we can group\
          \ qubits to work together to correct errors. In surface code quantum computing\
          \ , each group consists of a d x d square lattice of qubits called a surface\
          \ code, and each surface code represents a single encoded or “logical” qubit.\
          \ The bigger a surface code lattice, the more errors it can tolerate. The\
          \ expectation is that as the lattice gets bigger, the logical qubit is more\
          \ and more protected, and the logical performance improves. \n \n \n But\
          \ there’s a subtlety: making the lattice bigger also introduces more opportunities\
          \ for error . If the error rate of the physical qubits is too high, these\
          \ extra errors overwhelm the error correction so that making the lattice\
          \ bigger just makes the processor’s performance worse. Conversely, if the\
          \ error rate of the physical qubits is sufficiently low, then error correction\
          \ more than makes up for these extra errors. In fact, the encoded error\
          \ rate goes down exponentially as more qubits are added. The critical error\
          \ rate that divides these two cases, below which quantum error correction\
          \ transforms from harmful to helpful, is called the threshold . \n \n \n\
          \ \n \n Willow: beating the threshold Operating “below the threshold” has\
          \ been a goal for error corrected quantum computing since its inception\
          \ in the 1990s. However, after almost 30 years of advancement in device\
          \ fabrication, calibration, and qubit design, quantum computers still hadn’t\
          \ passed this landmark. That is, until our latest 105-qubit superconducting\
          \ processor, Willow. Willow represents a significant leap forward in quantum\
          \ hardware. It maintains the tunability of our previous architecture, Sycamore\
          \ , while improving the average qubit lifetimes (T 1 ) from about 20 μs\
          \ to 68 µs ± 13 µs. The qubits and operations in our device are optimized\
          \ with quantum error correction in mind, and run alongside our error correction\
          \ software, including state-of-the-art machine learning , reinforcement\
          \ learning , and graph-based algorithms to identify and correct errors accurately.\
          \ Using Willow, we report the first ever demonstration of exponential error\
          \ suppression with increasing surface code size. Each time we increase our\
          \ lattice in size from 3x3 to 5x5 to 7x7, the encoded error rate decreases\
          \ by a factor of 2.14. This culminates in a logical qubit whose lifetime\
          \ is more than twice that of its best constituent physical qubit, demonstrating\
          \ the capacity of an error-corrected qubit to go beyond its physical components.\
          \ \n \n \n Looking to the future Once you pass the threshold, small improvements\
          \ in the device are amplified exponentially with quantum error correction.\
          \ For example, while the operation fidelities in Willow are about twice\
          \ as good as Sycamore, the encoded error rates are about twenty times better.\
          \ Anticipating this rapid improvement, we can look ahead to questions that\
          \ will be relevant to future error-corrected quantum computers. \n \n \n\
          \ Can we build a near-perfect encoded qubit? Quantum error correction looks\
          \ like it’s working now, but there’s a big gap between the one-in-a-thousand\
          \ error rates of today and the one-in-a-trillion error rates needed tomorrow.\
          \ Could we run into new physics that could prevent us from building a quantum\
          \ computer? To answer this, we build repetition codes . Unlike surface codes,\
          \ which protect against all (local) quantum errors, repetition codes focus\
          \ solely on bitflip errors , but do so far more efficiently. By running\
          \ experiments with repetition codes and ignoring other error types, we achieve\
          \ lower encoded error rates while employing many of the same error correction\
          \ principles as the surface code. The repetition code acts as an advance\
          \ scout for checking whether error correction will work all the way down\
          \ to the near-perfect encoded error rates we’ll ultimately need. When running\
          \ repetition codes on Willow, we are able to realize nearly 10 billion cycles\
          \ of error correction without seeing an error. Exhibiting that level of\
          \ control over a quantum system, even when only protecting against bitflip\
          \ errors, is quite exciting. But there’s a catch — when we try to push the\
          \ encoded error rate lower by increasing the size of the code further, it\
          \ won’t budge. The reason for this behavior is currently under investigation,\
          \ and we’re confident that we can find it and fix it, just as we fixed a\
          \ similar problem with high-energy radiation on Sycamore. \n \n \n Can we\
          \ make error-corrected quantum computers fast? Compared to the gigahertz-frequency\
          \ device you’re probably reading this blog on, error-corrected quantum computers\
          \ are actually quite slow. Even superconducting quantum computers, which\
          \ are one of the fastest qubit technologies, have measurement times that\
          \ are about a microsecond long. The sub-nanosecond timescales of classical\
          \ operations are more than a thousand times faster. Quantum error-corrected\
          \ operations can be even slower , in part because we must also interpret\
          \ measurements to identify errors. This is done by classical software called\
          \ a quantum error decoder , which must process measurement information at\
          \ the rate the quantum computer produces it. In a first for superconducting\
          \ qubits, we demonstrate the ability to decode measurement information in\
          \ real time alongside the device. This is great news, but it must also be\
          \ tempered. Even when decoding is keeping up with the device, for certain\
          \ error-corrected operations, the decoder can still slow things down. We\
          \ measure a decoder delay time of 50 to 100 microseconds on our device,\
          \ and anticipate it will increase at larger lattice sizes. This delay could\
          \ significantly impact the speed of error-corrected operation, and if quantum\
          \ computers are to become practical tools for scientific discovery, we need\
          \ to improve upon it. \n \n \n What’s next? With error correction, we can\
          \ now in principle scale up our system to realize near-perfect quantum computing.\
          \ In practice, it’s not so easy — we still have a long way to go before\
          \ we reach our goal of building a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer.\
          \ \n \n \n At current physical error rates, we might need more than a thousand\
          \ physical qubits per surface code grid to realize relatively modest encoded\
          \ error rates of 10 -6 . Furthermore, all of this was accomplished on a\
          \ 105-qubit processor; can we achieve the same performance on a 1,000-qubit\

        text: "Quantum computers, which operate based on the fundamental laws of quantum\
          \ mechanics first observed at the atomic-scale, are an emerging technology\
          \ believed to be capable of computational tasks out of the reach of classical\
          \ digital computers. Potential applications of quantum computers range from\
          \ physical simulation – like calculating electronic energies of complex\
          \ molecules – to cryptography – such as cracking RSA encryption [1]. Despite\
          \ their revolutionary potential, quantum computers are extremely sensitive\
          \ to noise introduced through interactions with their environment. This\
          \ noise leads to computational errors, and today’s quantum computers are\
          \ too error-prone to compute the answers to problems that are of practical\
          \ utility where they outperform their classical digital counterparts. We\
          \ anticipate that we will need quantum error correction to protect quantum\
          \ computers from noise. \n Quantum error correction is a powerful tool for\
          \ combating the effects of noise. As with error correction in classical\
          \ systems, quantum error correction can exponentially suppress the rate\
          \ of errors by encoding information redundantly. Redundancy protects against\
          \ noise, but it comes at a price: an increase in the number of physical\
          \ quantum bits (qubits) used for computation, and an increase in the complexity\
          \ and duration of computations. The overhead associated with error correction\
          \ can be significant (at the scale of 1000x increases in qubit counts) when\
          \ implemented using the error-prone hardware of a quantum computer. This\
          \ has led to increasing levels of interest in so-called “ hardware-efficient\
          \ ” strategies for quantum error correction [2]. \n In this post, we dive\
          \ into the results of one of our latest experiments at the AWS Center for\
          \ Quantum Computing, published today in Physical Review X [3]. We introduce\
          \ a type of qubit developed at AWS that converts the majority of errors\
          \ into a class of errors called “erasure errors”. Erasure error detection\
          \ and correction, under the right circumstances, can lead to significant\
          \ reductions in error-correction overhead. Our work demonstrates initial\
          \ steps towards implementing this strategy using existing quantum hardware\
          \ based on superconducting quantum circuits, and indicates a potential accelerated\
          \ path forward for building quantum computers of practical utility. \n The\
          \ types of errors that affect qubits \n When we talk about protecting quantum\
          \ computers from errors, what types of errors are we talking about? Quantum\
          \ computers are built from qubits, which can be in one of two quantum states\
          \ (often labeled |0⟩ or |1⟩), or any superposition of these states. Just\
          \ like a classical bit can accidentally flip from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0,\
          \ a quantum bit can also experience a so-called “bit-flip” error where |0⟩\
          \ flips to |1⟩ or vice versa. But unlike classical bits, quantum bits can\
          \ also suffer from “phase-flip” errors, where a superposition |0⟩ + |1⟩\
          \ flips to |0⟩ – |1⟩. In fact, the difficulty of correcting both bit-flip\
          \ and phase-flip errors is one reason why error correction is much harder\
          \ for quantum computers than for classical computers. \n \n Figure 1. Three\
          \ types of errors affecting qubits: (1) bit-flip errors, (2) phase-flip\
          \ errors, and (3) erasure errors. \n \n Bit-flip and phase-flip errors share\
          \ a common trait, which is that they silently corrupt the state of the qubit\
          \ without the operator knowing. But recently, another framework for errors\
          \ has drawn significant attention, based on what are called “erasure errors.”\
          \ These errors also corrupt the state of the qubit, but unlike bit-flip\
          \ and phase-flip errors, erasure errors raise a flag to indicate that the\
          \ qubit was corrupted. \n If we can build a quantum computer out of qubits\
          \ that only have erasure errors, it becomes much easier to correct errors\
          \ as they occur since we actually know which qubits were corrupted. This\
          \ extra information allows us to reduce the redundancy and overhead that\
          \ would be needed to correct an equal number of silent bit-flip and phase-flip\
          \ errors. This idea has recently been gaining traction as a compelling strategy\
          \ to reduce error-correction overhead in several platforms for experimental\
          \ quantum computing, including in neutral atoms [4-6], superconducting circuits\
          \ [7-8], and trapped ions [9]. \n Designing an “erasure qubit” with superconducting\
          \ transmons \n An “erasure qubit” is a qubit which is designed to be primarily\
          \ limited by erasure errors, with only a minimal contribution of bit-flip\
          \ or phase-flip errors. To build such a qubit, we need to encode our qubit\
          \ in a protected way such that the physical processes that drive errors\
          \ in our hardware can only cause erasure errors. \n Our approach at the\
          \ AWS Center for Quantum Computing was to build erasure qubits out of standard\
          \ qubit components, called transmons [10]. Transmons are superconducting\
          \ circuit elements whose discrete quantum states can be controlled and used\
          \ for computation. Typically, it is common to rely on the lowest two energy\
          \ states of the transmon, |0⟩ and |1⟩, to encode a single qubit. These states\
          \ can be thought of as the transmon containing either 0 photons or 1 photon,\
          \ respectively. \n One of the main sources of errors in transmons is the\
          \ photon leaking out, which causes relaxation of the transmon from |1⟩ to\
          \ |0⟩. This is one example of a bit-flip error that scrambles the information\
          \ in a single transmon. To avoid such silent errors, we use an alternate\
          \ encoding proposed by our AWS team [7] that allows us to flag relaxation\
          \ events when they occur. \n \n Figure 2. We encode a single “dual-rail”\
          \ qubit in a pair of transmons in order to be able to flag errors that are\
          \ caused by photon leakage. \n \n Specifically, we use a “dual-rail” encoding\
          \ in two transmons, where the qubit is defined by the two states in which\
          \ just the left transmon has a photon (|10⟩), or just the right transmon\
          \ has a photon (|01⟩). In such an encoding, photon loss does not cause silent\
          \ errors between |01⟩ and |10⟩, but instead causes a transition into a third\
          \ state in which there are no photons left in the system (|00⟩). As long\
          \ as we can check the system to see if it still has one photon, we can find\
          \ out if an error occurred and “flag” an erasure error if no photons are\
          \ detected. \n \n Figure 3. Our dual-rail qubit is encoded by having a single\
          \ photon which is shared across the two transmons to suppress noise, while\
          \ still enabling us to flag photon leakage as an erasure. \n \n We’re almost\
          \ done with our qubit construction – but unfortunately relaxation is not\
          \ the only error mechanism in transmons which requires attention. A second\
          \ important source of errors is so-called “dephasing”, or fluctuations in\
          \ the transmon energy, which would cause the states |01⟩ and |10⟩ to experience\
          \ silent phase-flip errors. \n The solution to this problem requires a quick\
          \ technical deep-dive: rather than letting the transmons operate independently,\
          \ we couple them together. The single photon is now shared by the two transmons,\
          \ either symmetrically or anti-symmetrically, which defines our “logical”\
          \ qubit states: |0 L ⟩=|01⟩−|10⟩ and |1 L ​⟩=|01⟩+|10⟩. Since these states\
          \ both contain half a photon on average in each transmon, it turns out that\
          \ their energy gap is largely insensitive to the underlying transmon energy\
          \ fluctuations. While transmon dephasing can still cause both bit-flips\
          \ and phase-flips of the dual-rail qubit, these rates can be suppressed\
          \ by multiple orders of magnitude compared to the error rates on the underlying\
          \ transmons. This enables the dual-rail qubit to be highly coherent, even\
          \ if the underlying transmon qubit building blocks are themselves very noisy.\
          \ \n At this stage, we have the core ingredients of an erasure qubit: a\
          \ pair of states |0 L ⟩,|1 L ​⟩ which should have very few bit-flip and\
          \ phase-flip errors, and which should primarily be affected just by erasure\
          \ errors (leakage to the state |00⟩). \n The next step is to test it experimentally\
          \ and show: \n \n How rare are the residual bit-flip and phase-flip errors\
          \ relative to the erasure errors? \n Can we detect the leakage to |00⟩ in\
          \ order to truly flag photon loss as erasure errors? \n \n Erasure qubit\
          \ performance \n To test the use of the dual-rail system as an erasure qubit,\
          \ our team at the AWS Center for Quantum Computing designed and fabricated\
          \ a device composed of three transmons – two of which encode the dual-rail\
          \ qubit, while the third is used as an ancilla for detecting and flagging\
          \ erasure errors. This device was cooled down to 10 millikelvin in a dilution\
          \ fridge. \n Error rates on the dual-rail qubit \n We examine the rates\
          \ of the different types of errors by preparing the system in various states\
          \ and tracking its evolution over time. In particular, our goal is to determine\
          \ the fraction of total errors which are erasure errors versus silent bit-flip\
          \ and phase-flip errors. The erasure error rate is measured by initializing\
          \ the system in any state like |0 L ​⟩ or |1 L ​⟩ and measuring the probability\
          \ of finding the system in |00⟩ after some time. We find that this decay\
          \ occurs on a typical timescale of around 30 µs, consistent with independent\
          \ measurements of the rate of photons leaking out of these transmons. \n\
          \ \n Figure 4. Example measurement of error rates on the dual-rail qubit.\
          \ We observe a short timescale for erasure errors caused by decay to |00&gt;.\
          \ In instances where we did not have such decay, we preserve coherence for\
          \ much longer millisecond-scale levels. \n \n The bit-flip and phase-flip\
          \ error rates are extracted by focusing on the instances where a photon\
          \ was not lost. Bit-flip errors are measured by preparing the system in\
          \ |1 L ​⟩ and measuring the probability of finding it in |0 L ​⟩ at a later\
          \ time (or vice versa). Similarly, to measure phase-flip errors we prepare\
          \ the dual-rail qubit in a superposition |0 L ​⟩+|1 L ​⟩​ and measure the\
          \ probability of finding it in the wrong superposition (|0 L​ ⟩−|1 L ​⟩)\
          \ at a later time. These two types of measurements reveal that bit-flip\
          \ and phase-flip errors take place on a much longer time scale of close\
          \ to 1 ms, roughly 30x longer than the timescale for errors on the underlying\
          \ transmons composing the dual-rail qubit. \n As anticipated, the ratio\
          \ of error timescales indicates that the vast majority of errors (&gt; 96%)\
          \ in our dual-rail qubit are erasure errors (leakage to |00⟩), with only\
          \ a small fraction (&lt; 4%) of residual (silent) bit-flip and phase-flip\
          \ errors. This is a strong indicator that if we can accurately flag the\
          \ erasures, then we can efficiently correct most errors that occur in this\
          \ system. \n Detecting erasure errors using an ancilla qubit \n To check\
          \ if a qubit had an erasure error, we have to do a measurement to see if\
          \ the dual-rail system is in the |00⟩ state. In particular, we want to distinguish\
          \ |00⟩ from the |0 L ⟩,|1 L ⟩ states. However, it is important that we do\
          \ not reveal the dual-rail qubit’s logical state if no erasure had occurred.\
          \ For example, if the dual-rail pair is in |0 L ⟩+|1 L ⟩, the erasure check\
          \ should indicate that no erasure has occurred and leave the system in this\
          \ superposition ( without collapsing it into either |0 L ⟩ or |1 L ⟩, which\
          \ would effectively introduce new silent phase-flip errors into the system).\
          \ \n \n Figure 5. The ancilla transmon is shifted in its energy depending\
          \ on the state of the dual-rail qubit, allowing us to detect if the dual-rail\
          \ has decayed to |00&gt;. \n \n This is a rather delicate type of measurement\
          \ to perform. To accomplish this, we use a third “ancilla” transmon which\
          \ is weakly coupled to the dual-rail qubit. The presence or absence of the\
          \ single photon in the dual-rail pair causes a shift of the energy of the\
          \ ancilla. This shift is roughly the same for the two dual-rail states |0\
          \ L​ ⟩ and |1 L ​⟩ which each contain a single photon, but the shift is\
          \ different for the state |00⟩ in which there are no photons. As a result,\
          \ by measuring the energy of the ancilla transmon, we can determine if the\
          \ dual-rail has decayed to |00⟩ without distinguishing |0 L ⟩ and |1 L ⟩.\
          \ \n This approach, at least in principle, allows high-fidelity detection\
          \ of erasure errors without causing additional errors on the dual-rail qubit.\
          \ To verify this point experimentally, we prepare the system in a superposition\
          \ |0 L ​⟩+|1 L ​⟩ and perform a sequence of repeated erasure checks to see\
          \ if the superposition is destroyed. We find very low rates of errors (&lt;0.1%)\
          \ induced by each check, validating this approach as a viable method of\
          \ erasure detection. \n Conclusion \n These experiments, described in our\
          \ recent publication [3], complete the picture of our dual-rail qubit as\
          \ an “erasure qubit” – most errors that occur are indeed erasure errors,\
          \ and those erasure errors can be detected without introducing new errors\
          \ into the system. This work is just the beginning of an exciting path with\
          \ transmon-based erasure qubits, with major next steps needed to complete\
          \ the error-correction toolbox with these new qubits and scale up to larger\
          \ systems. By incorporating new ideas like erasure errors into standard\
          \ transmon processors, we hope to improve error correction performance in\
          \ ways that are compatible with other state-of-the-art developments in the\
          \ field. \n Indeed, this strategy of hardware-efficient error correction\
          \ is just one part of a large sphere of technical challenges in scaling\
          \ up quantum computers, complementing other critical work such as systematic\
          \ improvement of device performance and construction of scalable controls.\
          \ All pieces of technological development must come together on this incredibly\
          \ exciting road towards large-scale, useful quantum computing. \n References\

          \ Photonics (2024). DOI: 10.1063/5.0230335\n \n Physicists from the University\
          \ of the Witwatersrand (Wits) have developed an innovative computing system\
          \ using laser beams and everyday display technology, marking a significant\
          \ leap forward in the quest for more powerful quantum computing solutions.\
          \ \n The breakthrough, achieved by researchers at the university's Structured\
          \ Light Lab, offers a simpler and more cost-effective approach to advanced\
          \ quantum computing by harnessing the unique properties of light. This development\
          \ could potentially speed up complex calculations in fields such as logistics,\
          \ finance and artificial intelligence. The research was published in the\
          \ journal APL Photonics as the editor's pick. \n \"Traditional computers\
          \ work like switchboards, processing information as simple yes or no decisions.\
          \ Our approach uses laser beams to process multiple possibilities simultaneously,\
          \ dramatically increasing computing power,\" says Dr. Isaac Nape, the Optica\
          \ Emerging Leader Chair in Optics at Wits. \n The research team, including\
          \ MSc students Mwezi Koni and Hadrian Bezuidenhout, built their system using\
          \ surprisingly ordinary components—laser beams, digital displays similar\
          \ to those found in projectors, and simple lenses. \n The key was linking\
          \ how light interacts with optical devices, such as digital displays and\
          \ lenses, to the mathematical operations that a quantum operation in a quantum\
          \ computer performs. These operations can be simply broken down to multiplication\
          \ and addition (using vectors and matrices) all performed at the speed of\
          \ light. \n Once this was achieved, they showcased the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm,\
          \ a clever test determining whether an operation performed by a computer\
          \ is random or predictable—something a quantum computer can do far faster\
          \ than any classical computing machine. \n \"Our work paves the way for\
          \ simulating even more complex quantum algorithms,\" Koni adds. \"This could\
          \ unlock exciting new possibilities in areas like quantum optimization and\
          \ quantum machine learning.\" \n Their method can handle far more information\
          \ than conventional computers, which are limited to working with just ones\
          \ and zeros. \n \"We've shown that our system can work with 16 different\
          \ levels of information instead of just the two used in classical computers,\"\
          \ says Koni, who led the experiment. \"In theory, we could expand this to\
          \ handle millions of levels, which would be a game-changer for processing\
          \ complex information.\" \n What makes this development particularly significant\
          \ for South Africa and other emerging economies is its accessibility. The\
          \ system uses readily available equipment, making it a practical option\
          \ for research laboratories that may not have access to more expensive computing\
          \ technologies. \n \"Light is an ideal medium for this kind of computing,\"\
          \ says Bezuidenhout. \"It moves incredibly fast and can process multiple\
          \ calculations simultaneously. This makes it perfect for handling complex\
          \ problems that would take traditional computers much longer to solve.\"\
          \ \n The research forms part of the WitsQ Quantum Initiative and is supported\
          \ by the South African Quantum Initiative (SAQuTI), positioning South Africa\
          \ at the forefront of advanced computing research . The team is now working\

        text: "Google says the Willow chip has it confidently on a path to the kind\
          \ of quantum computing that could tackle seemingly insurmountable real-world\
          \ problems.\n \n Google on Monday showed off a new quantum computing chip\
          \ that it said was a major breakthrough that could bring practical quantum\
          \ computing closer to reality. \n A custom chip called \"Willow\" does in\
          \ minutes what it would take leading supercomputers 10 septillion years\
          \ to complete, according to Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven. \n\
          \ \"Written out, there is a 1 with 25 zeros,\" Neven said of the time span\
          \ while briefing journalists. \"A mind-boggling number.\" \n Neven's team\
          \ of about 300 people at Google is on a mission to build quantum computing\
          \ capable of handling otherwise unsolvable problems like safe fusion power\
          \ and stopping climate change. \n \"We see Willow as an important step in\
          \ our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications\
          \ in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design and more,\"\
          \ said Google CEO Sundar Pichai on X. \n A quantum computer that can tackle\
          \ these challenges is still years away, but Willow marks a significant step\
          \ in that direction, according to Neven and members of his team. \n While\
          \ still in its early stages, scientists believe that superfast quantum computing\
          \ will eventually be able to power innovation in a range of fields. \n Quantum\
          \ research is seen as a critical field and both the United States and China\
          \ have been investing heavily in the area, while Washington has also placed\
          \ restrictions on the export of the sensitive technology. \n Olivier Ezratty,\

          \ private and public investment in the field has totaled around $20 billion\
          \ worldwide over the past five years. \n Regular computers function in binary\
          \ fashion: they carry out tasks using tiny fragments of data known as bits\
          \ that are only ever either expressed as 1 or 0. \n But fragments of data\
          \ on a quantum computer, known as qubits, can be both 1 and 0 at the same\
          \ time—allowing them to crunch an enormous number of potential outcomes\
          \ simultaneously. \n Crucially, Google's chip demonstrated the ability to\
          \ reduce computational errors exponentially as it scales up—a feat that\
          \ has eluded researchers for nearly 30 years. \n The breakthrough in error\
          \ correction, published in leading science journal Nature , showed that\
          \ adding more qubits to the system actually reduced errors rather than increasing\
          \ them—a fundamental requirement for building practical quantum computers.\

          problem
        url: https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/8/24120103/microsoft-says-its-cracked-the-code-on-an-important-quantum-computing-problem
        published_date: N/A
        text: Microsoft says it’s figured out how to improve error rates in quantum
          computing , bringing quantum computing closer to a commercial state. The
          company worked in collaboration with quantum computing hardware maker Quantinuum
          to improve the performance of the qubit — the very basic unit of quantum
          computing. Qubits work by holding two different phases at once (instead
          of just a one and a zero, it’s both), but they aren’t very stable, making
          it easy for them to lose data. Researchers can now create several “logical
          qubits,” or qubits that are more stable while holding these different states.
          Krysta Svore, vice president of advanced quantum development at Microsoft,
          told The Verge in an interview that because qubits are prone to errors,
          researchers needed to find a way to stabilize them. “We need reliable quantum
          computing, and not just in theory; we need to demonstrate that it can work
          in practice,” Svore says. “I like to think of it as putting noise-cancelling
          headphones on the qubits.” She says that these more reliable qubits help
          quantum computing “graduate” from level one, the more foundational level
          with qubits prone to mistakes and are usually referred to as noisy, to the
          next level, where scientists can run more calculations correctly and scale
          up the technology for more commercial use. Other quantum computing experts
          welcomed Microsoft and Quantinuum’s advancement. Henry Yuen, associate professor
          of computer science at Columbia and a theoretical computer scientist, tells
          the Verge via email this may just be the beginning of more discoveries that
          make quantum computing easier. “We’re far from the final destination, but
          the signposts are getting more frequent and are indicating that some major
          milestones are coming up soon,” Yuen says. “I’m sure there will be bigger
          and better demonstrations of quantum fault tolerance coming soon.” Microsoft
          brought its qubit-virtualization system, which Svore says “abstracts” groups
          of physical qubits together, to Quantiuum’s quantum computer to create virtual
          logical qubits. With it, users could create qubits with a longer fault tolerance,
          or time without encountering an error. The team created four reliable logical
          qubits from only 30 physical qubits. Previously, the scientific consensus
          was that hundreds of physical qubits were needed to make a couple of logical
          qubits that didn’t fail, and they would have taken decades to create. The
          teams ran 14,000 calculations without losing the quantum state and found
          they improved the error rate by a factor of 800 over physical qubits. Svore
          says the system could detect and fix errors without destroying the logical
          qubit and keeping the string of calculations going. Microsoft is now figuring
          out how to bring this capability to Azure Quantum Elements, its platform
          for scientists to use AI, high-performance computing, and quantum computing
          to run scientific experiments. Yuen says that while he thinks the term “quantum
          virtualization” may be Microsoft’s branding for error-correcting code, its
          findings could be scalable for other quantum computing companies to try
          on their own. Quantum computing has always seemed like far into the future
          innovation, despite the idea and experimentation being around for decades.
          Companies such as IBM , Microsoft, and Google have been trying to make quantum
          computing reliable, safe, cost-effective, and, more importantly, useful
          for years. Quantinuum chief product officer Ilyas Khan and senior director
          of offering management Jenni Strabley said in a blog post that they plan
          to continue improving the system to create more reliable logical qubits.
          “In the short term – with a hybrid supercomputer powered by a hundred reliable
          logical qubits, we believe that organizations will be able to start to see
          scientific advantages and will be able to accelerate valuable progress toward
          some of the most important problems that mankind faces such as modeling
          the materials used in batteries and hydrogen fuel cells or accelerating
          the development of meaning-aware AI language models,” Quantinuum said in
          its post. Now, with Microsoft and Quantiuum’s work, it’s up to others to
          see if they can replicate the same thing.
      - title: Google reveals quantum computing chip with ‘breakthrough’ achievements
        url: https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24317382/google-willow-quantum-computing-chip-breakthrough
        published_date: N/A
        text: Google’s quantum computing lab just achieved a major milestone. On Monday,
          the company revealed that its new quantum computing chip, Willow, is capable
          of performing a computing challenge in less than five minutes — a process
          Google says would take one of the world’s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion
          years, or longer than the age of the universe. That’s a big jump from 2019
          when Google announced its quantum processor could complete a mathematical
          equation in three minutes, as opposed to 10,000 years on a supercomputer.
          IBM disputed the claim at the time. Along with more powerful performance,
          researchers also found a way to reduce errors, something Google calls “one
          of the greatest challenges in quantum computing.” Instead of bits, which
          represent either 1 or 0, quantum computing uses qubits, a unit that can
          exist in multiple states at the same time, such as 1, 0, and anything in
          between. As noted by Google, qubits are prone to errors because they “have
          a tendency to rapidly exchange information with their environment.” However,
          Google’s researchers discovered a way to reduce errors by introducing more
          qubits to a system and were able to correct them in real time. Their findings
          were published in Nature . “This historic accomplishment is known in the
          field as ‘below threshold’ — being able to drive errors down while scaling
          up the number of qubits,” Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven writes
          on Google’s blog. “You must demonstrate being below threshold to show real
          progress on error correction, and this has been an outstanding challenge
          since quantum error correction was introduced by Peter Shor in 1995.” Willow,
          which has 105 qubits, “now has best-in-class performance,” according to
          Neven. Microsoft , Amazon , and IBM are working on quantum computing systems
          of their own. Google’s next goal is to perform a first “useful, beyond-classical”
          computation that is both “relevant to a real-world application” and one
          that typical computers can’t achieve. Going forward, Neven says quantum
          technology will be “indispensable” for collecting AI training data, eventually
          helping to “discover new medicines, designing more efficient batteries for
          electric cars, and accelerating progress in fusion and new energy alternatives.”
