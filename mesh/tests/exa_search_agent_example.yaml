      answer: 'As of March 15, 2025, quantum error correction (QEC) remains a critical
        area in quantum computing, focusing on techniques to protect quantum information
        from errors caused by decoherence and noise. QEC works by encoding information
        in a way that allows for the detection and correction of errors, typically
        by combining multiple physical qubits into a more robust logical qubit ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_error_correction),
        [Riverlane](https://www.riverlane.com/quantum-error-correction)).


        Recent advancements include Google''s development of the Willow processor,
        which showcases how error-corrected qubits can improve exponentially as they
        scale up ([Google Research](https://research.google/blog/making-quantum-error-correction-work)).
        Additionally, research continues to explore various quantum error correction
        codes and their implementation, which are essential for achieving practical
        quantum computing capabilities ([Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-024-08449-y),
        [Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/quantum/concepts-error-correction)).'
