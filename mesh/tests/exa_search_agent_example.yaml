      query: What are the latest developments in quantum computing?
      raw_data_only: false
    output:
      response: 'Recent developments in quantum computing indicate a rapid transition
        from theoretical research to practical applications and commercialization,
        with significant progress in hardware, software, and industry adoption.


        Here are some of the latest developments:


        **1. Hardware Advancements and Error Correction:**

        *   **Increased Qubit Counts and Stability:** Companies like Caltech have
        demonstrated record-breaking arrays with 6,100 neutral-atom qubits that maintained
        superposition for 13 seconds, a significant improvement in coherence times
        (September 2025). IBM''s experimental processor, IBM Quantum Loon, has demonstrated
        all key components needed for fault-tolerant quantum computing (November 2025).

        *   **Error Reduction Breakthroughs:** Quantum error correction has seen dramatic
        progress. Google''s Willow quantum chip, with 105 superconducting qubits,
        achieved exponential error reduction, completing a benchmark calculation in
        five minutes that would take a classical supercomputer 10^25 years (December
        2024, mentioned in 2025 reports). Microsoft''s Majorana 1 topological qubit
        architecture aims for inherent stability with less error correction overhead,
        showing a 1,000-fold reduction in error rates (February 2025).

        *   **Diverse Qubit Modalities:** The field continues to explore various qubit
        technologies, including superconducting circuits, trapped ions, neutral atoms,
        photonic qubits, and silicon spin qubits. New approaches like Microsoft''s
        topological qubits and Amazon''s Ocelot chip (combining cat qubits with transmon
        qubits) are emerging, and Quantum Circuits is using a "dual-rail" control
        mechanism for improved reliability (various dates in 2025).

        *   **Manufacturing Scale-up:** IBM has shifted its primary fabrication of
        quantum processor wafers to an advanced 300mm wafer facility, doubling its
        R&D speed and increasing the physical complexity of quantum chips tenfold
        (November 2025).


        **2. Demonstrations of Quantum Advantage and Commercial Applications:**

        *   **Real-world Problem Solving:** In March 2025, IonQ and Ansys performed
        a medical device simulation on a 36-qubit computer, outperforming classical
        high-performance computing by 12%. D-Wave''s quantum annealing technology
        reduced scheduling times for Ford Otosan from 30 minutes to under five (March
        2025).

        *   **Faster Computation:** Google''s Quantum Echoes algorithm demonstrated
        a verifiable quantum advantage, running 13,000 times faster on Willow than
        on classical supercomputers for an out-of-order time correlator algorithm
        (October 2025).

        *   **Industry-Specific Use Cases:** Early real-world value is being seen
        in simulating molecules for drug discovery (e.g., Google''s collaboration
        with Boehringer Ingelheim on Cytochrome P450 simulation), optimizing logistics
        and supply chains, and real-time financial modeling (e.g., HSBC using IBM''s
        Heron for bond trading predictions, improving them by 34%) (various dates
        in 2025).


        **3. Market Momentum and Investment:**

        *   **Surging Investments:** Venture capital funding for quantum startups
        surged to over USD 2 billion in 2024, with USD 1.25 billion in the first three
        quarters of 2025 alone. National governments invested USD 10 billion by April
        2025, up from USD 1.8 billion in all of 2024. Companies like PsiQuantum raised
        $1 billion in funding (September 2025), and Quantinuum secured $800 million
        (November 2025).

        *   **Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS):** Cloud-based quantum services are democratizing
        access to quantum computing, allowing organizations to experiment without
        massive capital investments in hardware.

        *   **Public Offerings:** Several quantum companies are pursuing public offerings,
        such as Infleqtion merging with a SPAC (expected late 2025/early 2026) and
        PsiQuantum anticipating a 2026 IPO.


        **4. Cybersecurity and Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC):**

        *   **NIST Standards Finalized:** The National Institute of Standards and
        Technology (NIST) finalized its principal set of encryption algorithms designed
        to withstand quantum computer attacks in August 2024, releasing three new
        PQC standards (ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA) ready for immediate implementation.

        *   **Migration Urgency:** Google researchers demonstrated in May 2025 that
        advances in quantum operations could make breaking RSA encryption 20 times
        easier, accelerating the need for enterprises to transition to quantum-safe
        encryption.

        *   **Government Initiatives:** The White House has initiated policy acceleration
        for federal adoption of quantum technology and PQC migration, recognizing
        the decade-long effort required for such a transition.


        **5. Workforce and Education:**

        *   **Talent Shortage:** The industry faces a significant talent gap, with
        only one qualified candidate for every three specialized quantum positions
        globally. McKinsey estimates over 250,000 new quantum professionals will be
        needed by 2030.

        *   **Educational Mobilization:** The United Nations designated 2025 as the
        International Year of Quantum Science and Technology, catalyzing educational
        initiatives worldwide. Universities like MIT are expanding quantum curricula,
        and cloud-based platforms are democratizing access to quantum education (2025).


        Overall, the quantum computing industry is moving from a "potential technology"
        to "practical products," with a strong focus on improving coherence, connectivity,
        error correction, and overall system reliability, alongside increasing investment
        and strategic partnerships. While fault-tolerant, general-purpose quantum
        computers are still some years away, domain-specific, high-value use cases
        are beginning to emerge.

              [Back] \n![Latest Developments in Quantum Computing - 2026 Edition]\
              \ \nQuantum computing has once been a niche topic of research, but now\
              \ it is rapidly moving towards finding a firm spot in commercial applications.\
              \ Factors like advancement in hardware and components, AI-powered software\
              \ applications, a mature business ecosystem, and an increase in enterprise\
              \ investment in innovative solutions like quantum computing have set\
              \ a strong foundation for quantum wave in the coming years. In 2026,\
              \ we can expect quantum to move from&ldquo;potential technology&rdquo;\
              \ to&ldquo;practical products&rdquo;. Quantum computing has come a long\
              \ way, and recent developments look quite transformative. Let&#39;s\
              \ delve deeper and understand the emerging trends and the state of**[quantum\
              \ computing in the near future] **, and what global organizations should\
              \ be watching.\n**Hardware and System Maturity**\n**Technology leaders\
              \ in industry**acknowledge that quantum computing is moving from demonstration\
              \ to deployment rapidly. The&ldquo;noisy intermediate-scale quantum&rdquo;\
              \ (NISQ) era is evolving quite rapidly into an era where correction,\
              \ stability, and larger-scale architectures are priorities.\nAs per\
              \ McKinsey and Company&rsquo;s Quantum Technology Monitor 2025, the\
              \ industry is moving towards improving coherence, connectivity, and\
              \ overall system reliability rather than simply adding qubits.\n**Specific\
              \ developments in this sector include:**\n* Increasing efforts are made\
              \ in grouping and controlling physical qubits to minimize errors and\
              \ create more stable computation\n* Focus on a more holistic system\
              \ where hardware manufacturers is working closely with software teams,\
              \ algorithm developers, and ecosystem partners to work on full-stack\
              \ solutions rather than isolated quantum chips\n* Diverse qubit modalities\
              \ and quantum hardware platforms\nIn essence, quantum hardware is getting\
              \ more advanced. Though we are still far from developing a fully fault-free\
              \ machine, we have advanced to a great extent in making building blocks\
              \ robust and future-ready.\n**Market Momentum and Ecosystem Growth**\n\
              Tech giants are pushing hard to make**quantum computing**a feasible\
              \ commercial product/service, and it is not limited to just academic\
              \ curiosity. Several consultancy reports clear this notion.\nAccording\
              \ to McKinsey, the three-pillar quantum ecosystem (quantum computing-\
              \ quantum communication- quantum sensing) could generate nearly tens\
              \ of billions of dollars of revenue by the mid-2030s. Another report\
              \ by Bain &amp; Company highlighted that quantum computing is moving\
              \ from&ldquo;theoretical to inevitable&rdquo; and predicts a lot of\
              \ value in the future.\nAlso, investment activity is increasing for\
              \ quantum computing at an unprecedented rate. As per Quantum Insider,\
              \ there are numerous small/huge funding rounds and multi-year contracts\
              \ that clearly show**quantum computing**is moving from experimentation\
              \ to early commercialization.\nFrom startups to technology giants to\
              \ governments, investment in quantum ecosystems is growing, and this\
              \ is a positive sign.\n**Emerging Trends and Strategic Use-Cases**\n\
              * **Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS) and Democratization**\nInstead of each\
              \ organization building its own dedicated quantum hardware, they can\
              \ leverage cloud-based quantum services and hybrid development models.\
              \ It will help organizations to experiment with and adopt quantum tools\
              \ without investing much.\n* **Hybrid Classical-Quantum Architectures**\n\
              **Technology leaders in industry**should also keep in mind that quantum\
              \ computers are not a replacement for traditional computing. Bain predicts\
              \ the future computer environment will be more like a&ldquo;mosaic&rdquo;\
              \ of CPUs/GPUs powered by quantum accelerators designed for specific\
              \ problem types.\n* **Error Correction, Logical Qubits, and Fault Tolerance**\n\
              The focus is on moving towards a fault-free machine from NISQ. So, skilled\
              \ professionals, including**[data scientists, AI scientists] **, and\
              \ engineers, are working towards building logical qubits and improving\
              \ gate fidelity as well as extending coherence times and improving how\
              \ they control qubits.\n* **Quantum Computing and Cybersecurity**\n\
              The introduction of**quantum computing in the near future**presents\
              \ a dual opportunity in the field of cybersecurity, and its implications\
              \ can already be felt. Quantum computers can make many of the existing\
              \ cryptographic systems vulnerable. Therefore, organizations are rushing\
              \ towards post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum-secure communications.\n\
              * **Focus on Industry Applications**\nWe might also see industry-specific\
              \ quantum computing and not only broad-purpose machines. The early real-world\
              \ value will likely come from specific industries such as simulating\
              \ molecules, discovering materials, optimizing logistics and supply\
              \ chains, real-time financial modeling, etc. According to McKinsey,\
              \ chemicals, life science, finance, and mobility sectors have the highest\
              \ potential for**quantum computing**.\n* **Hardware Modality Diversity**\n\
              There are multiple developments in quantum hardware. From superconducting\
              \ to trapped ion and photonic qubits to hybrid systems, the field of\
              \ quantum computing is witnessing real hardware advancements. On top\
              \ of that, we can also see regional innovation hubs across the globe\
              \ making every effort to leverage existing hardware to develop and power\
              \ quantum computing.\n**Challenges and Realistic Timeframes**\nThough\
              \ we are advancing faster towards quantum computing,**technology leaders\
              \ in the industry**have to effectively address a few challenges for\
              \ more accurate results. Here are a few things to consider:\n* Despite\
              \ rapid advancements, we are still quite far from achieving fault-free\
              \ and general-purpose quantum computers. Bain notes we are yet to achieve\
              \ several key breakthroughs like hardware scale, algorithm maturity,\
              \ ROI evidence, etc.\n* It is difficult to achieve practical return\
              \ on investment as it requires quantum to perform at par with classical\
              \ computers continuously.\n* Key challenges like data loading, designing\
              \ algorithms, and integration in a hybrid environment are still bottlenecks\
              \ to real-world use cases. Quantum systems work in an entirely different\
              \ manner than classical ones; therefore, organizations have to employ\
              \ new disciplines\n* Most importantly, lack of skilled workforce, underdeveloped\
              \ infrastructure, and limitations in the supply chain of exotic materials,\
              \ cryogenics, and quantum fabrication are the real problems. This prevents\
              \ full-scale deployment of**quantum computing**to the production environment\
              \ from the lab.\nConsidering these points, several**[technology leaders\
              \ in the industry] **feel that domain-specific and high-value quantum\
              \ use-cases might emerge in the coming few years, but the broader enterprise\
              \ will still take at least a decade of time for full-scale adoption.\n\
              **Strategic Takeaways for Organizations**\nNow, the important thing\
              \ &ndash; what is it for enterprises today, and what do they need to\
              \ do?\nGiven the rapid development, organizations across the globe should\
              \ employ these strategic actions:\n* **Start evaluating your quantum\
              \ readiness**\nAccess your existing technology infrastructure, common\
              \ business problems, and evaluate if quantum computing can help you\
              \ solve the problems identified\n* **Invest in skills**\nIt can be a\
              \ great strategic step to develop quantum literacy within your organization.\
              \ Also, consider partnering with quantum service providers and software\
              \ vendors that might give you an early advantage\n* **Consider a hybrid\
              \ strategy**\nAdopting only quantum systems will not only be expensive\
              \ but also inefficient. So, adopt a hybrid approach, i.e., using**[quantum\
              \ computing] **alongside classical computers.\n* **Prepare for cybersecurity\
              \ challenges**\nQuantum computing can be a game-changer in the field\
              \ of cybersecurity. Cybercriminals are already harvesting data to decrypt\
              \ it later. So, start preparing now and prepare for post-quantum cryptography\n\
              * **Pilot use-cases**\nStart with smaller and result-oriented projects\
              \ where quantum systems can truly deliver value. Consider projects where\
              \ classical computers struggle, like large combinatorial optimization\
              \ or complex molecular simulation.\n**Quantum Computing Is All Theory-\
              \ Not Any More!**\nThe rapid technological advancement has transformed\
              \ quantum from theoretical to commercial. Several factors, including\
              \ advanced hardware, increased interest and investment, and innovations,\
              \ are fueling the development and adoption of quantum computing. But\
              \ remember, the technology has not yet developed, and we are still far\
              \ from achieving foundational breakthroughs. However, for business and\
              \ technology leaders worldwide, the goal should be clear &ndash; to\
              \ build future-ready skills, work on pilot projects, and design a hybrid\
              \ infrastructure. Those who start embracing quantum computing from now\
              \ on will definitely be far ahead of their competition and gain a competitive\
              \ advantage.\n## Most Popular\n* [Why Are Edge AI and Tiny ML Critical\

              \ computing, UBS says\nPublished Mon, Jan 19 20268:46 AM EST\n![thumbnail]\

              With tech stocks benefiting from sky-high valuations, one quickly-growing\
              \ corner could define the sector's next chapter. That's because quantum\
              \ computing offers \"extraordinary potential,\" according to UBS, which\
              \ highlighted several key stocks leading the industry. Quantum computing\
              \ companies have gained the attention of Wall Street over the past year,\
              \ particularly as Alphabet, IBM and Microsoft launched efforts to develop\
              \ and build the first practical quantum computer . Consequently, some\
              \ smaller, highly volatile companies, including IonQ , have soared over\
              \ the past 12 months. Quantum computing remains a fragmented and immature\
              \ market, UBS analysts led by Madeleine Jenkins wrote in a 103-page\
              \ report to clients on Monday. The bank sees the technology having the\
              \ greatest impact in three areas: molecular simulation, optimization\
              \ and AI, and cryptography. 'Meaningful breakthroughs' \"With tech valuations\
              \ at an all-time high, we believe now is the time to learn about any\
              \ potential disruptive forces. Whilst progress has been slow and there\
              \ have been many challenges, we are starting to see meaningful breakthroughs\
              \ in the quantum space,\" the 11 UBS analysts named on the report wrote.\
              \ \"By harnessing the behavior of the smallest particles, quantum computing\
              \ promises to unlock unprecedented computational power at a fraction\
              \ of today's cost,\" they continued. \"The era of quantum advantage\
              \ (where quantum significantly outperforms classical systems), could\
              \ arrive as early as the 2030s. This level of compute would require\
              \ the equivalent of 10²¹ GPUs to simulate, yet cost only tens of millions\
              \ to build.\" UBS said there are multiple ways to make a qubit —the\
              \ basic unit of quantum information —and that many industries could\
              \ adopt the technology. Superconducting and trapped-ion qubits are the\
              \ most advanced today, she said, narrowing leadership in quantum computing\
              \ to just a few stocks. \"Success will hinge on which architecture prevails;\
              \ and as it stands, we see superconducting/trapped ion as the most promising.\
              \ Alphabet/IBM are betting on superconducting qubits, while Microsoft/\
              \ Amazon -offer mixed modalities via the cloud,\" Jensen wrote. Public\
              \ companies that are pure plays on quantum technology include IonQ,\
              \ D-Wave Quantum and Rigetti Computing , the Jenkins team added. IONQ\
              \ 1Y mountain IonQ stock performance over the past year. Google, owned\
              \ by Alphabet, has been a \"pioneer\" in quantum computing and is currently\
              \ the leader in software and quantum error correction, especially with\
              \ the breakthroughs achieved by its quantum chip Willow released in\
              \ Dec. 2024, UBS said. Willow was able to reduce errors exponentially\
              \ by using more qubits and perform a standard benchmark computation\
              \ in under 5 minutes that would take one of today's fastest supercomputers\
              \ 10 septillion years, the report said. Microsoft and Amazon are more\
              \ diversified, with their mixed modalities approach to quantum development,\
              \ Jenkins wrote. Microsoft is both partnering with smaller, pureplay\
              \ quantum hardware companies, such as IonQ, and researching a new type\
              \ of topological architecture that could lead to a more stable and fast\
              \ qubit, she said. UBS rates both Microsoft and Amazon a buy, and rates\
              \ Alphabet neutral. \"Who will win out will depend largely on the modality\
              \ of qubit that succeeds first,\" the analyst said. The smaller companies\
              \ involved in quantum computing have alternately seen outsized gains\
              \ followed by sharp declines over the past year, making them far more\
              \ volatile than the broad market. IonQ, the largest of the three, with\
              \ a market value topping $17 billion, has soared 72% in the past 12\
              \ months through Wednesday, but slumped 34% since mid-October. Its adjusted\
              \ beta is 2.37, according to FactSet data, meaning its more than twice\
              \ as volatile as the average stock.\n## [More In Analyst Calls] \n[\n\

              \ of Breakthrough Milestones and Commercial Transition\n2025.10.31·BlogQuantum\
              \ Industry Trends 2025\nThe quantum computing industry has reached an\
              \ inflection point in 2025, transitioning from theoretical promise to\
              \ tangible commercial reality. What was once confined to research laboratories\
              \ and expert discussions has evolved into a sector attracting billions\
              \ in investment, government support, and corporate partnerships. This\
              \ transformation reflects fundamental breakthroughs in hardware, software,\
              \ error correction, and most importantly, the emergence of practical\
              \ applications that demonstrate real-world quantum advantage.\n## Market\
              \ Expansion and Investment Momentum\nThe financial landscape for quantum\
              \ computing in 2025 reflects unprecedented investor confidence. The\
              \ global quantum computing market reached USD 1.8 billion to USD 3.5\
              \ billion in 2025, with projections indicating growth to USD 5.3 billion\
              \ by 2029 at a compound annual growth rate of 32.7 percent. More aggressive\
              \ forecasts suggest the market could reach USD 20.2 billion by 2030,\
              \ representing a 41.8 percent CAGR, positioning quantum computing as\
              \ one of the fastest-growing technology sectors of the decade.\nVenture\
              \ capital funding has surged dramatically, with over USD 2 billion invested\
              \ in quantum startups during 2024, representing a 50 percent increase\
              \ from 2023. The first three quarters of 2025 alone witnessed USD 1.25\
              \ billion in quantum computing investments, more than doubling previous\
              \ year figures. Major institutional players have signaled their commitment\
              \ to the sector: JPMorgan Chase announced a USD 10 billion investment\
              \ initiative specifically naming quantum computing as a strategic technology,\
              \ while governments worldwide have invested USD 3.1 billion in 2024,\
              \ primarily linked to national security and competitiveness objectives.\n\
              ## Hardware Breakthroughs: The Error Correction Revolution\nPerhaps\
              \ the most significant development in 2025 has been the dramatic progress\
              \ in quantum error correction, addressing what many considered the fundamental\
              \ barrier to practical quantum computing. Google's Willow quantum chip,\
              \ featuring 105 superconducting qubits, achieved a critical milestone\
              \ by demonstrating exponential error reduction as qubit counts increased—a\
              \ phenomenon known as going \"below threshold.\" The Willow chip completed\
              \ a benchmark calculation in approximately five minutes that would require\
              \ a classical supercomputer 10^25 years to perform, providing strong\
              \ evidence that large, error-corrected quantum computers can be constructed\
              \ in the future.\nIBM unveiled its fault-tolerant roadmap, centered\
              \ on the Quantum Starling system targeted for 2029, which will feature\
              \ 200 logical qubits capable of executing 100 million error-corrected\
              \ operations. The company plans to extend operations to 1,000 logical\
              \ qubits by the early 2030s and quantum-centric supercomputers with\
              \ 100,000 qubits by 2033, utilizing quantum low-density parity-check\
              \ codes that reduce overhead by approximately 90 percent.\nMicrosoft\
              \ introduced Majorana 1, a topological qubit architecture built on novel\
              \ superconducting materials designed to achieve inherent stability requiring\
              \ less error correction overhead. The company's novel four-dimensional\
              \ geometric codes require very few physical qubits per logical qubit\
              \ and exhibit a 1,000-fold reduction in error rates. In collaboration\
              \ with Atom Computing, Microsoft demonstrated 28 logical qubits encoded\
              \ onto 112 atoms and successfully created and entangled 24 logical qubits,\
              \ representing the highest number of entangled logical qubits on record.\n\
              Recent breakthroughs have pushed error rates to record lows of 0.000015%\
              \ per operation, and researchers at QuEra published algorithmic fault\
              \ tolerance techniques that reduce quantum error correction overhead\
              \ by up to 100 times, moving timelines for practical quantum computing\
              \ substantially forward. NIST research through the SQMS Nanofabrication\
              \ Taskforce achieved coherence times of up to 0.6 milliseconds for the\
              \ best-performing qubits, a significant advancement for superconducting\
              \ quantum technology.\n## The Path to Quantum Advantage and Practical\
              \ Applications\nIn March 2025, IonQ and Ansys achieved a significant\
              \ milestone by running a medical device simulation on IonQ's 36-qubit\
              \ computer that outperformed classical high-performance computing by\
              \ 12 percent—one of the first documented cases of quantum computing\
              \ delivering practical advantage over classical methods in a real-world\
              \ application. Google announced the Quantum Echoes algorithm breakthrough,\
              \ demonstrating the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage running\
              \ the out-of-order time correlator algorithm, which runs 13,000 times\
              \ faster on Willow than on classical supercomputers. The company also\
              \ demonstrated molecular geometry calculations using nuclear magnetic\
              \ resonance, creating a \"molecular ruler\" that measures longer distances\
              \ than traditional methods.\nResearch institutions have identified convergence\
              \ points where quantum computing could address significant scientific\
              \ workloads. A National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center\
              \ study found that quantum resource requirements have declined sharply\
              \ while industry roadmaps project hardware capabilities rising steeply.\
              \ The analysis suggests that quantum systems could address Department\
              \ of Energy scientific workloads—including materials science, quantum\
              \ chemistry, and high-energy physics—within five to ten years. Materials\
              \ science problems involving strongly interacting electrons and lattice\
              \ models appear closest to achieving quantum advantage, while quantum\
              \ chemistry problems have seen algorithm requirements drop fastest as\
              \ encoding techniques have improved.\n## Industry Adoption and Quantum-as-a-Service\
              \ Evolution\nThe commercialization of quantum computing has accelerated\
              \ through Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS) platforms offered by IBM, Microsoft,\
              \ and emerging providers including SpinQ, democratizing access to quantum\
              \ computing and reducing barriers to entry for organizations exploring\
              \ quantum applications. These cloud-based models enable broader experimentation\
              \ and accelerate commercial adoption across industries, allowing companies\
              \ to conduct pilot projects without massive capital investments in quantum\
              \ hardware infrastructure.\nMajor corporations continue expanding their\
              \ quantum initiatives. In April 2025, Fujitsu and RIKEN announced a\
              \ 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer—four times larger than\
              \ their 2023 system—with plans for a 1,000-qubit machine by 2026. IBM's\
              \ roadmap calls for the Kookaburra processor in 2025 with 1,386 qubits\
              \ in a multi-chip configuration featuring quantum communication links\
              \ to connect three chips into a 4,158-qubit system. Atom Computing's\
              \ neutral atom platform has attracted attention from DARPA, with the\
              \ company demonstrating utility-scale quantum operations and planning\
              \ to scale systems substantially by 2026.\nQuantum computing partnerships\
              \ are reshaping the ecosystem. Strategic alliances between hardware\
              \ developers, cloud providers, and industry-specific application companies\
              \ have created integrated platforms combining quantum processors with\
              \ classical co-processing units. These hybrid quantum-classical architectures\
              \ represent the realistic path to near-term practical quantum systems,\
              \ addressing the limitations of pure quantum approaches while leveraging\
              \ quantum capabilities for specific problem classes where they excel.\n\
              ## The Emerging Quantum Software and Algorithm Landscape\nAlgorithmic\
              \ development has become increasingly sophisticated in 2025. Beyond\
              \ the well-established Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum\
              \ Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), new algorithms are being\
              \ developed specifically for finance, logistics, chemistry, and materials\
              \ science applications. AI-driven quantum algorithm discovery is accelerating\
              \ development timelines, while quantum machine learning transitions\
              \ from theoretical interest to practical implementation, particularly\
              \ in applications where traditional AI struggles with data complexity\
              \ or scarcity.\nResearch from quantum companies and academic institutions\
              \ demonstrates that co-design—where hardware and software are developed\
              \ collaboratively with specific applications in mind—has become a cornerstone\
              \ of quantum innovation. This approach integrates end-user needs early\
              \ in the design process, yielding optimized quantum systems that extract\
              \ maximum utility from current hardware limitations. Initiatives by\
              \ QuEra and other companies focused on developing error-corrected algorithms\
              \ underscore the importance of aligning technology with practical applications.\n\
              ## Quantum Applications Across Industries\nPharmaceutical research represents\
              \ one of the most advanced application domains. Google's collaboration\
              \ with Boehringer Ingelheim demonstrated quantum simulation of Cytochrome\
              \ P450, a key human enzyme involved in drug metabolism, with greater\
              \ efficiency and precision than traditional methods. These advances\
              \ could significantly accelerate drug development timelines and improve\
              \ predictions of drug interactions and treatment efficacy.\nFinancial\
              \ services has emerged as an early adopter sector. JPMorgan Chase partnered\
              \ with IBM to explore quantum algorithms for option pricing and risk\
              \ analysis, with early studies indicating quantum models could outperform\
              \ classical Monte Carlo simulations in both speed and scalability. The\
              \ financial industry is anticipated to become one of the earliest beneficiaries\
              \ of commercially useful quantum computing, with technologies expected\
              \ to become available within the next few years.\nSupply chain optimization,\
              \ battery development, materials science, cryptography, and artificial\
              \ intelligence represent additional high-priority application areas\
              \ where quantum computing demonstrates significant potential impact.\
              \ University of Michigan scientists used quantum simulation to solve\
              \ a 40-year puzzle about quasicrystals, proving that exotic materials\
              \ are fundamentally stable through atomic structure simulation with\
              \ quantum algorithms.\n## Post-Quantum Cryptography: A National Security\
              \ Priority\nThe emergence of practical quantum computing has elevated\
              \ cybersecurity to a critical priority. NIST finalized its principal\
              \ set of encryption algorithms designed to withstand quantum computer\
              \ attacks in August 2024, releasing three new post-quantum cryptography\
              \ standards containing computer code, implementation instructions, and\
              \ intended uses. The standards—ML-KEM (based on lattice cryptography),\
              \ ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA—are ready for immediate implementation.\nThe White\
              \ House has initiated quantum policy acceleration, preparing executive\
              \ actions focused on federal adoption of quantum technology and post-quantum\
              \ cryptography migration. These directives aim to set federal agency\
              \ timelines for transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic standards\
              \ ahead of fault-tolerant quantum computer development. Industry experts\
              \ estimate that transitioning government and enterprise networks to\
              \ post-quantum cryptography could require a decade or more due to the\
              \ complexity of legacy infrastructure, making policy acceleration timely\
              \ and strategically necessary.\n## The Quantum Workforce Crisis and\
              \ Educational Mobilization\nDespite unprecedented investment and breakthroughs,\
              \ the quantum industry faces a significant talent shortage. Only one\
              \ qualified candidate exists for every three specialized quantum positions\
              \ globally, and U.S. quantum-related job postings have tripled from\
              \ 2011 to mid-2024. The McKinsey &amp; Company research estimates that\
              \ over 250,000 new quantum professionals will be needed globally by\
              \ 2030, creating an immediate and growing demand for skilled quantum\
              \ workforce members.\nIn response, 2025 has witnessed significant educational\
              \ mobilization. The United Nations designated 2025 as the International\
              \ Year of Quantum Science and Technology, celebrating 100 years since\
              \ the initial development of quantum mechanics. This recognition has\
              \ catalyzed educational and training initiatives worldwide. Universities\
              \ are expanding quantum curricula from research-focused doctoral programs\
              \ to undergraduate and certificate-level offerings. MIT, for example,\
              \ expanded its quantum education cohort from a dozen students in its\
              \ inaugural year to 65 students, with the institution now offering executive\
              \ education programs accessible online globally.\nSpinQ Technology has\
              \ positioned itself at the forefront of quantum education through its\
              \ dual-track approach combining educational nuclear magnetic resonance\
              \ systems with industrial-grade superconducting quantum computers. The\
              \ company's training ecosystem addresses workforce development challenges\
              \ through hands-on hardware access, authentic quantum experiences, and\
              \ expert-led instruction, recognizing that practical quantum computing\
              \ expertise requires interaction with real quantum systems, not merely\
              \ simulations.\nCloud-based quantum computing platforms have democratized\
              \ quantum education access, enabling learners worldwide to develop quantum\
              \ skills without expensive on-site infrastructure or geographical constraints.\
              \ These platforms provide remote access to quantum processors, simulators,\
              \ and development tools, fundamentally transforming how students and\
              \ professionals engage with quantum technology.\n## Strategic Government\
              \ Initiatives and International Competition\nGovernment support for\
              \ quantum technologies has reached unprecedented levels across multiple\
              \ nations. The U.S. National Quantum Initiative has invested USD 2.5\
              \ billion in programs between 2019 and 2024, establishing Quantum Leap\
              \ Challenge Institutes and the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory as\
              \ national resources for quantum research and development. The U.S.\
              \ Chips and Science Act included provisions for evaluating quantum workforce\
              \ needs and initiatives.\nInternational competition in quantum computing\
              \ has intensified. China's national venture fund has committed RMB 1\
              \ trillion (approximately USD 140 billion) for quantum technology development,\
              \ while Europe advances through the Quantum Flagship Program coordinating\
              \ research across member states. Countries including Canada, Australia,\
              \ South Korea, and Japan have announced ambitious quantum initiatives\
              \ emphasizing workforce expansion, technology development, and international\
              \ collaboration.\nDARPA has initiated the Underexplored Systems for\
              \ Utility Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) program, investigating whether\
              \ any quantum computing approach can achieve utility-scale operation\
              \ where computational value exceeds cost by 2033. This initiative provides\
              \ structured government support for diverse quantum architectures including\
              \ topological qubits, photonic qubits, and neutral atom systems.\n##\
              \ Quantum Stock Market Performance and IPO Activity\nThe equity markets\
              \ have responded enthusiastically to quantum computing developments.\
              \ Pure-play quantum companies have delivered extraordinary returns,\
              \ with D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) surging over 3,700 percent in the\

              \ and industrial systems platform, is preparing for a Hong Kong or Shenzhen\
              \ Stock Exchange listing within 12-18 months.\n## Key Technology Trends\
              \ Shaping the Industry\nSix major trends dominate the 2025 quantum computing\
              \ landscape: increased experimentation with logical qubits as error\
              \ correction matures; development of specialized hardware and software\
              \ for specific problem classes rather than universal quantum computing\
              \ approaches; increased networking of noisy intermediate-scale quantum\
              \ devices together; additional layers of software abstraction facilitating\
              \ easier quantum programming; expanded workforce development tools and\
              \ training programs; and continuous improvement in physical qubit performance\
              \ through novel materials and fabrication techniques.\nCo-design methodologies\
              \ have become increasingly prevalent, with hardware and software teams\
              \ collaborating from project conception to optimize systems for specific\
              \ applications. This approach acknowledges that current quantum computers\
              \ cannot solve a wide range of problems and emphasizes extracting maximum\
              \ utility from limited resources through tight hardware-software integration.\n\
              The convergence of quantum computing with artificial intelligence and\
              \ machine learning has accelerated. Hybrid quantum-AI systems are expected\
              \ to impact optimization, drug discovery, and climate modeling, while\
              \ AI-assisted quantum error mitigation substantially enhances quantum\
              \ technology reliability and scalability.\n## Looking Forward: The Next\
              \ Phase of Quantum Computing\nThe quantum computing industry in 2025\
              \ stands at a genuine inflection point. The fundamental barriers that\
              \ many researchers considered insurmountable—quantum error correction,\
              \ scalability, practical advantage demonstration—are being systematically\
              \ addressed through coordinated technical innovation. The industry has\
              \ transitioned from asking \"if\" quantum computing will be practically\
              \ useful to \"when\" and \"which applications will benefit first.\"\n\
              Investment capital, government support, workforce development initiatives,\
              \ and demonstrated technical breakthroughs have created a robust ecosystem\
              \ supporting commercial quantum computing development. While significant\
              \ challenges remain in scaling systems, improving error rates, and developing\
              \ applications that reliably outperform classical approaches, the trajectory\
              \ suggests that meaningful commercial quantum computing applications\
              \ could emerge within the next five to ten years for specific problem\
              \ classes in drug discovery, materials science, optimization, and cryptography.\n\
              The convergence of hardware breakthroughs, software innovation, post-quantum\
              \ cryptography standards, strategic government initiatives, and growing\
              \ workforce development efforts indicates that 2025 represents a watershed\
              \ moment for quantum computing. The technology is transitioning from\
              \ the domain of specialized researchers and theoretical physicists to\
              \ mainstream industry attention, capital allocation, and practical application\
              \ development—marking the beginning of the quantum computing age.\n\

              \ The year isn&#039;t over yet, but we&#039;ve already seen record-breaking\
              \ quantum computers, skyrocketing levels of investment, and demonstrations\
              \ of real-world benefits.\n![Preparing your organisation for the quantum\
              \ threat] \nCredit: Shutterstock\nIn all the hype about AI it can be\
              \ easy to forget that we&rsquo;re witnessing another revolution in computing:\
              \ the beginning of the quantum era.\nQuantum computers are expected\
              \ to tackle problems completely out of reach of today&rsquo;s machines,\
              \ bringing about new developments in chemistry, biology and physics.\
              \ They&rsquo;ll also be able to tackle problems of interest to the average\
              \ enterprise, such as logistics, AI and encryption, proponents say.\n\
              At the beginning of this year, however, it all seemed far away.\n&ldquo;AI\
              \ is dominating the attention economy,&rdquo; says James Sanders, semiconductor\
              \ industry analyst at TechInsights. &ldquo;The incrementalism of quantum\
              \ computing is difficult to translate to public interest, against the\
              \ backdrop of AI.&rdquo;\nIn fact, in January, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\
              \ said that[quantum computing is still 15 to 30 years from being truly\
              \ useful].\nThe industry spent the year trying to prove him wrong. Here\
              \ are 10 areas in which we&rsquo;ve seen significant breakthroughs and\
              \ milestones in quantum computing.\n## 1. World&rsquo;s most powerful\
              \ computer enables quantum AI\nOn November 5, Quantinuum[announced the\
              \ commercial launch] of its new Helios quantum computer, claiming to\
              \ be the most accurate commercial system available today. &ldquo;You\
              \ would need to harvest every star in the universe to power a classical\
              \ machine that could do the same calculations we did with Helios,&rdquo;\
              \ said[Anthony Ransford], Helios lead architect, in a statement.\nAccording\
              \ to the company, it&rsquo;s the most accurate computer to date, can\
              \ be programmed just like a classical computer, and uses industry tools\
              \ like[Nvidia&rsquo;s CUDA-Q]. In addition, early testers such as SoftBank\
              \ and JPMorgan Chase have already conducted &ldquo;commercially relevant\
              \ research,&rdquo; the company said. Other early testers include Amgen,\
              \ which is exploring hybrid quantum-machine learning for biologics,\
              \ and BMW, which is doing research on fuel cells.\n&ldquo;For the first\
              \ time enterprises can access a highly accurate, general-purpose quantum\
              \ computer to drive real world impact,&rdquo; said Rajeeb Hazra, Quantinuum\
              \ president and CEO, in the announcement.\nQuantinuum also partnered\
              \ with Nvidia to accelerate the combination of quantum computing and\
              \ generative AI via NVQLink.\nIn a sign of how seriously the industry\
              \ is taking the company, Fidelity just joined Quantinuum&rsquo;s[latest\
              \ funding round], bringing the total to $800 million raised, for a valuation\
              \ of $10 billion.\n![Quantinuum Helios quantum computer] \nThe Helios\
              \ quantum computing platform is available to customers through Quantinuum&rsquo;s\
              \ cloud service and on-premises offering.\nQuantinuum\n## 2. Record\
              \ levels of investment\nQuantinuum isn&rsquo;t the only company to rake\
              \ in money this year. In September, photonic qubits company PsiQuantum\
              \ became the world&rsquo;s most funded quantum startup,[raising $1 billion\
              \ in funding] to build a commercially useful quantum computer. That\
              \ brought its valuation to $7 billion, which was a lot at the time.\n\
              According to[research from SpinQ], quantum computing companies raised\
              \ $3.77 billion in equity funding during the first nine months of 2025\
              \ &mdash; nearly triple the $1.3 billion raised in all of 2024.\nThere\
              \ are also publicly-traded quantum computing firms, chief among them\
              \ being Rigetti, IonQ, Quantum Computing and D-Wave, and their stock\
              \ prices have been on a wild ride lately.[According to Motley Fool],\
              \ share prices have gone up by more than 3,000% over the past year.\n\
              &ldquo;Such significant financings reflect investor confidence in near-term\
              \ commercialization milestones,&rdquo; says[Yuval Boger], chief commercial\
              \ officer at QuEra Computing. &ldquo;And they prompt vendors, customers\
              \ and funding agencies to treat quantum technologies as entering a deployment\
              \ phase rather than purely an R&amp;D play.&rdquo;\nIn fact, national\
              \ governments invested $10 billion by April of this year, up from $1.8\
              \ billion in all of 2024, according to SpinQ.\nMost recently, on November\
              \ 6, DARPA announced the next stage of its Quantum Benchmarking Initiative,[selecting\
              \ 11 quantum computing firms] for up to $15 million each in funding\
              \ to help get us to utility-scale computing by 2033.\n## 3. Commercial\
              \ applications\nLike Quantinuum&rsquo;s testers, a number of companies\
              \ have said they&rsquo;re finding commercial value in quantum computing.\n\
              In September, HSBC announced that they were able to use IBM&rsquo;s\
              \ Heron quantum computer to[improve their bond trading predictions by\
              \ 34%] compared to classical computing alone. While this is the only\
              \ public announcement, so far, of using quantum computing for trading,\
              \ it doesn&rsquo;t mean that other financial firms aren&rsquo;t already\
              \ doing it without publicity.\n![HSBC uses IBM Heron quantum computer\
              \ ] \nHSBC is using IBM&rsquo;s Heron quantum computer to improve their\
              \ bond trading predictions by 34% compared to classical computing.\n\
              HSBC\nIn March, engineering company Ansys used IonQ&rsquo;s quantum\
              \ computer to[speed up its analysis of fluid interactions in medical\
              \ devices] by 12% compared to classical computing alone.\nAlso in March,\
              \ Ford Otosan announced that they used[D-Wave&rsquo;s quantum annealing\
              \ technology] to reduce scheduling times from 30 minutes to less than\
              \ five. And this wasn&rsquo;t just a test. This is deployed in production.\n\
              D-Wave&rsquo;s quantum computer is not a general-purpose quantum machine\
              \ like those made by other quantum computing companies but is more akin\
              \ to an analogue computer. But it is particularly good at solving optimization\
              \ problems such as those that come up in logistics and supply chain\
              \ management.\nIn July, D-Wave sponsored a survey,[conducted by Wakefield\
              \ Research], of 400 business leaders working in optimization. According\
              \ to the survey, 81% of leaders said that they&rsquo;ve reached the\
              \ limit of what they can do with classical computers, and 53% are already\
              \ planning to build quantum computing into their workflows. Twenty-two\
              \ percent said that they already see quantum making a &ldquo;huge impact&rdquo;\
              \ for the early adopters, and another 50% expect it to be disruptive\
              \ for the industry. Of those who haven&rsquo;t yet implemented quantum\
              \ optimization, 31% expect to roll it out within the next two years.\n\
              Another emerging use case for quantum computing is the combination of\
              \ quantum and AI. In a May survey of 500 global business leaders by\
              \ SAS,[60% said they are actively investing in], or exploring opportunities,\
              \ in quantum AI.\nAnd, according to a[report by Bain], quantum computing\
              \ could unlock up to $250 billion of market value for the pharmaceutical,\
              \ finance, logistics, and materials science industries &mdash; though\
              \ the total market for quantum computing is less than $1 billion today.\n\
              ## 4. Quantum error correction reaches practical milestones\nAll of\
              \ the above announcements were made possible by[dramatic improvement\
              \ in error correction].\nThe problem is that qubits are very sensitive.\
              \ Vibrations, temperature changes, really anything can cause them to\
              \ generate errors. To address the problem, quantum computing companies\
              \ added extra qubits as backups. But as the quantum computers got bigger,\
              \ the error rates would go up even faster, meaning that it was impossible\
              \ to catch up.\nIn the last couple of years, researchers started to\
              \ find ways around this problem, both in making the individual qubits\
              \ less prone to errors, and by improving the error-correction mechanisms.\
              \ This year, the error-correction announcements became a tsunami of\
              \ progress.\nCompanies announcing error-correction developments this\
              \ year include QuEra, with its &ldquo;[magic states] &rdquo; announcement,\
              \ as well as[Alice &amp; Bob],[Microsoft],[Google],[IBM],[Quantinuum],[IonQ],[Nord\
              \ Quantique],[Infleqtion], and[Rigetti], among others.\n&ldquo;I think\
              \ we&rsquo;re very comfortably in the era of escape velocity,&rdquo;\
              \ says[Fred Chong], ACM Fellow and a professor at University of Chicago.\
              \ &ldquo;The quantum devices are fairly good, and error correction codes\
              \ have gotten better.&rdquo; Chong is also the chief scientist for quantum\
              \ software at Infleqtion and an advisory board member for Quantum Circuits.\n\
              This means that building a big, useful, quantum computer is no longer\
              \ a physics problem but an engineering problem, he says. And since engineering\
              \ progresses more reliably than basic science, quantum companies are\
              \ no longer waiting for science breakthroughs that may or may not happen.\n\
              IBM released its[updated quantum roadmap] in June, laying out its plans\
              \ for a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2029. IonQ also\
              \ released its[accelerated roadmap] in June, with 1,600 logical qubits\
              \ in 2028, 8,000 in 2029, and 80,000 in 2030.\n## 5. More firms join\
              \ the &lsquo;quantum advantage&rsquo; club\nQuantum computing is still\
              \ in its infancy, so when one of these tiny new quantum computers outperforms\
              \ a giant classical supercomputer, it&rsquo;s big news. This year, several\
              \ companies joined the quantum advantage club &mdash; or claimed that\
              \ they had.\nIn March, D-Wave announced that they&rsquo;d achieved the\
              \ world&rsquo;s &ldquo;first and only demonstration of quantum computational\
              \ supremacy on a useful, real-world problem.&rdquo; The company claimed\
              \ that[its annealing quantum computer outperformed one of the world&rsquo;s\
              \ most powerful classic supercomputers] in solving a magnetic materials\
              \ simulation problem.\nIn China, scientists at the University of Science\
              \ and Technology of China[reported in August] that their Jiuzhang 4.0\
              \ photonic quantum computer achieved quantum advantage &mdash; but for\
              \ a very narrow, limited-use Gaussian boson sampling task. Still, the\
              \ supercomputer El Capitan would have taken longer than the age of the\
              \ universe to carry out the same task, the researchers said &mdash;\
              \ specifically a million trillion trillion trillion years.\nIn October,\
              \ IonQ said it had already[achieved quantum advantage in drug discovery\
              \ and engineering applications] and, in a separate announcement, said\
              \ that it had[surpassed classical methods in chemistry simulations].\n\
              Also in October, Google announced that they were able to[run a verifiable\
              \ test] where their quantum computer was 13,000 times faster than the\
              \ world&rsquo;s fastest classical supercomputer. Google said that this\
              \ was the first time in history that this happened. Specifically, that\
              \ this was the first time such a test was run with a verifiable algorithm,\
              \ one that anyone could go out and test for themselves.\nThe thing is,\
              \ it&rsquo;s hard to compare apples to apples here, because every company\
              \ uses the benchmark that makes its own computers look best.\n&ldquo;Everybody\
              \ solves the problem with some combination of hardware and software\
              \ tricks,&rdquo; says[Sridhar Tayur], professor at Carnegie Mellon University&rsquo;s\
              \ Tepper School of Business. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t there be a set of\
              \ benchmarks, where you write down exactly what you did, what classical\
              \ computer did you use, how much time was spent on classical, and how\
              \ much time was spent on quantum? That would be nice &mdash; but that\
              \ has been missing. There has been no verification and no comparison.&rdquo;\n\
              However, IBM has[released a set of industry benchmarks] this year, he\
              \ adds.\nIn July, IBM researchers also[released a paper] explaining\
              \ why it is so difficult to accurately evaluate quantum advantage claims.\
              \ According to IBM, real quantum advantage requires industry consensus\
              \ &mdash; but that this will be achieved sometime before the end of\
              \ 2026. The researchers also added that IBM itself has already surpassed\
              \ classical computers in some respects.\n&ldquo;We have arrived already\
              \ at a place where quantum computing is a useful scientific tool capable\
              \ of performing computations that even the best exact classical algorithms\
              \ can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the researchers wrote. &ldquo;We and our partners\
              \ are already conducting a range of experiments on quantum computers\
              \ that are competitive with the leading classical approximation methods.&rdquo;\n\
              For example, in June, IBM partnered with RIKEN to use the IBM Quantum\
              \ Heron processor alongside the[Fugaku supercomputer] to simulate molecules\
              \ at a level beyond the ability of classical computers alone, and at\
              \ &ldquo;utility scale,&rdquo; IBM said.\n## 6. New hardware breakthroughs\
              \ in size and qubit types\nMany companies announced hardware breakthroughs\
              \ this year, including[Microsoft&rsquo;s new Majorana 1 chip] and[Amazon&rsquo;s\
              \ new Ocelot chip]. (Google announced their new Willow chip in December\
              \ of last year.)\nBut the biggest announcement, in terms of the number\
              \ of qubits involved, has to be[Caltech&rsquo;s record-breaking 6,100-qubit\
              \ array].\nIn a September announcement, Caltech researchers said that\
              \ they split a laser beam into 12,000 parts in order to trap 6,100 cesium\
              \ atoms. These qubits stayed in superposition for 13 seconds, ten times\
              \ longer than previous arrays, and were even able to move the atoms\
              \ round. Being able to move qubits opens the door to more efficient\
              \ error correction and is a key benefit of this neutral atom approach\
              \ to quantum computers.\n![Caltech 6100 qubit array] \nCaltech physicists\
              \ create 6,100-qubit array. Kon H. Leung is seen working on the apparatus\
              \ used to trap 6,100 atoms.\nCaltech/Gyohei Nomura\n## 7. Quantum-classical\
              \ hybrids become all the rage\nIBM wasn&rsquo;t the only company combining\
              \ quantum computers with classical ones for extra oomph.\nNvidia has\
              \ leaned into this heavily. At the end of October, the company[announced\
              \ an open system architecture] for coupling its GPUs with quantum processors\
              \ to build quantum supercomputers. The new platform, called NVQLink,\
              \ is also integrated with Nvidia&rsquo;s CUDA-Q quantum software platform.\n\
              Partners include many of the top firms in the quantum computing industry,\
              \ including Alice &amp; Bob, Anyon Computing, Atom Computing, Diraq,\
              \ Infleqtion, IonQ, IQM Quantum Computers, ORCA Computing, Oxford Quantum\
              \ Circuits, Pasqal, Quandela, Quantinuum, Quantum Circuits Inc., Quantum\
              \ Machines, Quantum Motion, QuEra, Rigetti, SEEQC and Silicon Quantum\
              \ Computing &mdash; as well as quantum control system builders including\
              \ Keysight Technologies, Quantum Machines, Qblox, QubiC and Zurich Instruments.\n\
              &ldquo;If you think of the science and chemistry problems people anticipate\
              \ solving with quantum computers, the way we solve them today is with\
              \ high performance computing,&rdquo; says[Scott Buchholz], government\
              \ and public services CTO and quantum computing lead at Deloitte. &ldquo;So\
              \ having them talk to each other, and having each one focus on the things\
              \ it&rsquo;s strongest on, is actually a good idea.&rdquo;\n## 8. Qubit\
              \ types proliferate\nIf anyone was hoping that 2025 would help us see\
              \ which approach to quantum computing was going to be the winner, they\
              \ would be disappointed.\nWhile superconducting circuits &mdash; the\
              \ computers that look like giant chandeliers &mdash; were still big,\
              \ there was a lot of progress on other approaches.\nDARPA&rsquo;s list\
              \ of Quantum Benchmarking Initiative companies has two companies with\
              \ neutral atom qubits (Atom Computing and Quera), four companies with\
              \ silicon spin qubits (Diraq, Photonic, Quantum Motion, and Silicon\
              \ Quantum Computing), two companies with superconducting qubits (IBM\
              \ and Nord Quantique), two companies with trapped ion qubits (IonQ and\
              \ Quantinuum), and one company with photonic qubits (Xanadu).\nPsiQuantum\
              \ unveiled its photonic quantum processor in February. And we even saw\
              \ brand new types of qubits, such as Microsoft&rsquo;s new Majorana\
              \ 1 chip, which uses the topological qubit approach.\nAmazon&rsquo;s\
              \ Ocelot chip uses a unique hybrid approach, combining cat qubits with\
              \ transmon qubits. And[Quantum Circuits also follows a new approach].\
              \ It&rsquo;s a superconducting circuit qubit, but with a &ldquo;dual\
              \ rail&rdquo; control mechanism.\n&ldquo;With the dual-rail approach\
              \ we&rsquo;ve built a computer that&rsquo;s very reliable,&rdquo; says[Andrei\
              \ Petrenko], Quantum Circuits&rsquo; head of product. &ldquo;It combines\
              \ the reliability benchmarks of trapped ions and neutral atoms with\
              \ the speed of the superconducting platform.&rdquo; The dual-rail is\
              \ like a check-engine light, he adds. &ldquo;No other quantum computer\
              \ tells you in real time if it encounters an error, but ours does.&rdquo;\n\
              In October, Quantum Circuits announced a[partnership with Nvidia] and\
              \ support for CUDA-Q, and, in February, a[proof-of-concept project]\
              \ related to drug discovery.\n## 9. Post-quantum cryptography becomes\
              \ enterprise priority\nIn May, Google researchers combined advances\
              \ in error correction and quantum operations with more efficient algorithms\
              \ to make breaking RSA encryption[20 times easier]. That means enterprises\
              \ may have less time than they planned to[move to the new quantum-safe\
              \ encryption algorithms].\n&ldquo;Our post-quantum cryptography team\
              \ is ringing the fire bell,&rdquo; says[Isabella Bello Martinez], senior\
              \ quantum technologist at Booz Allen Hamilton.\nWith the industry advancing\
              \ to fault-tolerant computers faster than expected, the deadline is\
              \ approaching quickly. &ldquo;That is a cause for concern for organizations\
              \ who have not yet thought about post-quantum cryptography,&rdquo; she\
              \ says. &ldquo;Or they think that someone else will take care of it,\
              \ that Microsoft will take care of it &mdash; you have to think about\
              \ how everything you use works together.&rdquo;\nAnd it&rsquo;s more\
              \ than just the fact that adversaries will be able to use quantum computers\
              \ to decrypt today&rsquo;s standard encryption someday. They can also\
              \ vacuum up encrypted data now and save it to decrypt later.\nFortunately,\
              \ we do now have five[NIST-certified post-quantum algorithms].\n## 10.\
              \ Nobel Prize in Physics for superconducting quantum circuits\nFinally,\
              \ to cap off a groundbreaking year for quantum computing, three scientists[received\
              \ the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics] for their work on superconducting\
              \ quantum circuits. The work itself was done in the 1980s and showed\
              \ that quantum effects can show up even in large-scale things &mdash;\
              \ a super-cold superconducting circuit can effectively act as it was\
              \ a single quantum object, as if it was a single atom or subatomic particle.\n\
              The fact that they got the award this year shows how important this\
              \ work has become to today&rsquo;s quantum computers and sensors. According\
              \ to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prizes,\
              \ these awards are given for &ldquo;achievements that have conferred\
              \ the greatest benefit to humankind.&rdquo;\nSuperconducting circuits\
              \ are the foundational technology for many of today&rsquo;s most advanced\
              \ quantum computers, including those built by Google and IBM, says University\
              \ of Chicago&rsquo;s Chong, as well as quantum sensors. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re\
              \ relatively large, much larger than an atom,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;Larger\
              \ than you would expect to see quantum effects. This macroscale is what\
              \ this Nobel Prize is recognizing.&rdquo;\nWho would have expected 2025\
              \ to turn out to be as big for quantum as it was? Well, the United Nations,\
              \ for one. In mid-2024, the United Nations declared 2025 to be the[International\
              \ Year of Quantum Science and Technology].\nAnd so far, it is.\n[High-Performance\

              \ quantum computing to the world,\" said Jay Gambetta, Director of IBM\
              \ Research and IBM Fellow. \"We believe that IBM is the only company\
              \ that is positioned to rapidly invent and scale quantum software, hardware,\
              \ fabrication, and error correction to unlock transformative applications.\
              \ We are thrilled to announce many of these milestones today.\"\n**IBM\
              \ Quantum Computers Built to Scale Advantage**\nIBM is unveiling IBM\
              \ Quantum Nighthawk, its most advanced quantum processor yet and designed\
              \ with an architecture to complement high-performing quantum software\
              \ to deliver quantum advantage next year: the point at which a quantum\
              \ computer can solve a problem better than all classical-only methods.\n\
              IBM Nighthawk is expected to be delivered to IBM users by the end of\
              \ 2025, and will offer:\n* **120 qubits linked together with 218 next-generation\
              \ tunable couplers**to their four nearest neighbors in a square lattice,\
              \ an increase of over 20 percent more couplers compared to IBM Quantum\
              \ Heron.\n* This increased qubit connectivity will allow users to accurately\
              \ execute circuits with**30 percent more complexity**than on IBM's previous\
              \ processor while maintaining low error rates.\n* This architecture\
              \ will enable users to explore more computationally demanding problems\
              \ that require**up to 5,000 two-qubit gates**, the fundamental entangling\
              \ operations critical for quantum computation.\nIBM expects future iterations\
              \ of Nighthawk to deliver up to 7,500 gates by the end of 2026 and then\
              \ up to 10,000 gates in 2027. By 2028, Nighthawk-based systems could\
              \ support up to 15,000 two-qubit gates enabled by 1,000 or more connected\
              \ qubits extended through long-range couplers first demonstrated on\
              \ IBM experimental processors last year.\nIBM anticipates that the first\
              \ cases of verified quantum advantage will be confirmed by the wider\
              \ community by the end of 2026. To encourage their rigorous validation\
              \ and push forward the best quantum and classical approaches, IBM, Algorithmiq,\
              \ researchers at the Flatiron Institute, and[BlueQubit] are contributing\
              \ new results to an[open, community-led quantum advantage tracker] to\
              \ systematically monitor and verify emerging demonstrations of advantage.\n\
              Today, the community tracker supports three experiments for quantum\
              \ advantage across observable estimation, variational problems, and\
              \ problems with efficient classical verification. IBM encourages the\
              \ community to contribute to the tracker and push a back-and-forth with\
              \ the best classical methods.\n\"I'm proud that our team at Algorithmiq\
              \ is leading one of the three projects in the new quantum advantage\
              \ tracker. The model we designed explores regimes so complex that it\
              \ challenges all state-of-the-art classical methods tested so far,\"\
              \ said Sabrina Maniscalco, CEO and co-founder, Algorithmiq. \"We are\
              \ seeing promising experimental results, and independent simulations\
              \ from researchers at the Flatiron Institute validate its classical\
              \ hardness. These are only the first steps –quantum advantage will take\
              \ time to verify, and the tracker will let everyone follow that journey.\"\
              \n\"BlueQubit is proud to support IBM's efforts to track quantum advantage\
              \ claims and algorithms as quantum computers are entering a regime beyond\
              \ classical,\" said Hayk Tepanyan, CTO and co-founder, BlueQubit. \"\
              Through our work around peaked circuits, we are excited to help formalize\
              \ instances where quantum computers are starting to outperform classical\
              \ computers by orders of magnitude.\"\nTo pursue verified quantum advantage\
              \ on breakthrough quantum hardware, developers need to be able to highly\
              \ control their circuits and use high-performance classical computers\
              \ (HPC) to mitigate the errors that arise in computation.\nQiskit is\
              \ the world's best-performing quantum software stack, developed by IBM.\
              \ It is now giving developers more control than ever before by scaling\
              \ dynamic circuit capabilities that deliver a 24 percent increase in\
              \ accuracy at the scale of 100+ qubits. IBM is also extending Qiskit\
              \ with a new execution model that enables fine grain control and a C-API,\
              \ unlocking HPC-accelerated error mitigation capabilities that decreases\
              \ the cost of extracting accurate results by more than 100 times.\n\
              As quantum computers mature, the global quantum community is expanding\
              \ to HPC and scientific communities. IBM is delivering a C++ interface\
              \ to Qiskit, powered by a C-API, to enable users to program quantum\
              \ natively in existing HPC environments. IBM continues to lead the way\
              \ in advanced circuit execution capabilities including dynamic circuits\
              \ and increasing control over circuit execution for error mitigation.\n\
              By 2027, IBM plans to extend Qiskit with computational libraries in\
              \ areas such as machine learning and optimization to better solve fundamental\
              \ physical and chemistry challenges such as differential equations and\
              \ Hamiltonian simulations.\n**IBM Delivers Building Blocks Towards Fault-Tolerant\
              \ Quantum Computing**\nIn a parallel path, IBM is rapidly delivering\
              \ milestones towards building the world's first large-scale, fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computer by 2029.\nThe company is announcing IBM Quantum Loon,\
              \ its experimental processor that, for the first time, shows that IBM\
              \ has demonstrated all the key processor components needed for fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computing. IBM Loon will validate a new architecture to implement\
              \ and scale the components needed for practical, high-efficiency quantum\
              \ error correction. IBM has already demonstrated the breakthrough features\
              \ that will be incorporated into Loon, including the introduction of\
              \ multiple high-quality, low-loss routing layers to provide pathways\
              \ for longer, on-chip connections (or \"c-couplers\") that go beyond\
              \ nearest-neighbor couplers and physically link distant qubits together\
              \ on the same chip, as well as technologies to reset qubits between\
              \ computations.\nDelivering on another key pillar of fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computing, IBM has proven it is possible to use classical\
              \ computing hardware to accurately[decode] errors in real-time (less\
              \ than 480 nanoseconds) using qLDPC codes. This engineering feat has\
              \ been achieved a full year ahead of schedule. Together with Loon, this\
              \ demonstrates the cornerstones needed to scale qLDPC codes on high-speed,\
              \ high-fidelity superconducting qubits which form the core of IBM quantum\
              \ computers.\n**IBM Scales Fabrication to 300mm Facilities to Accelerate\
              \ Quantum Wafer Development**\nAs IBM scales its quantum computers,\
              \ it is announcing the primary fabrication of its[quantum processor\
              \ wafers] is being undertaken at an advanced 300mm wafer fabrication\
              \ facility at the Albany NanoTech Complex in New York.\nState-of-the-art\
              \ semiconductor tooling and always-on capabilities within this facility\
              \ have already accelerated the speed at which IBM can learn from, improve,\
              \ and expand the capabilities of its quantum processors; allowing the\
              \ company to increase their qubit connectivity, density, and performance.\
              \ To-date, IBM has been able to:\n* **Double the speed**of its research\
              \ and development efforts by cutting the time needed to build each new\
              \ processor by at least half;\n* **Achieve a ten-fold increase**in the\

              \ Outlook 2024\n[The top trends in tech 2024] \n## How does a quantum\
              \ computer work?\nClassical computing, the technology that powers your\
              \ laptop and smartphone, is built on bits. A bit is a unit of information\
              \ that can store either a zero or a one. By contrast, quantum computing\
              \ is built on quantum bits, or qubits, which can store both zeros*and*ones.\
              \ Qubits can represent any combination of both zero and one simultaneously;\
              \ this is called superposition, and it is a basic feature of any quantum\
              \ state. When a qubit’s subatomic particles are in a superposition state,\
              \ each subatomic particle can interact with and influence others, a\
              \ phenomenon called quantum interference. Quantum chips make up the\
              \ physical hardware that stores qubits, similar to microchips in classical\
              \ computers.\nWhen a classical computer uses multiple variables to solve\
              \ a problem, it must conduct a new calculation every time one of those\
              \ variables changes. Each calculation is a single path to a single result.\
              \ Quantum computers, on the other hand, can explore many paths in parallel\
              \ through superposition.\nAdditionally, qubits can interact with one\
              \ another through a phenomenon known as entanglement. Entanglement allows\
              \ qubits to scale exponentially; two qubits, for example, can store\
              \ and process four bits of information, three can process eight, and\
              \ so on. This exponential scaling gives quantum computers much more\
              \ power than classical computers.\nCurrently, organizations are mainly\
              \ using[five qubit technologies] in their attempts to build a scalable,\
              \ universal quantum computer. These technologies are photonic networks,\
              \ superconducting circuits, spin qubits, neutral atoms, and trapped\
              \ ions (exhibit).\n![Five main qubit technologies are competing to build\
              \ a scalable universal quantum computer.] \n## What are the most recent\
              \ advancements in quantum computing?\nSome heavyweight tech organizations\
              \ are already placing their bets on quantum technology. In 2024, Google\
              \ unveiled an experimental quantum computer that, in five minutes’ time,\
              \ could perform a calculation that would take most supercomputers ten\
              \ septillion years to finish—longer than the age of the known universe.\
              \ Google’s quantum chip, called Willow, is primarily suited for research\
              \ and specialized fields. Other organizations are also developing their\
              \ own quantum computers, and as of 2022, the Chinese government had[pledged\
              \ $15.3 billion in public funds] to quantum computing.\nIn February\
              \ 2025, Microsoft[announced the discovery of a new state of matter]\
              \ that it says will support a quantum computing breakthrough. After\
              \ 17 years of physics research, the tech giant unveiled the Majorana\
              \ 1 quantum chip. This microprocessor harnesses the properties of a\
              \ material called a “topological qubit,” which yields particles that\
              \ are neither liquid, solid, nor gas—though the reality of the new state\
              \ of matter as well as the practical use of the new quantum machines\
              \ has yet to be proven. Microsoft says the chip could be used to accelerate\
              \ drug discovery, battery development, and the race toward AI dominance.\
              \ Many scientists agree that Microsoft’s topological qubits could lead\
              \ to much more efficient and less complex error correction. They could\
              \ also help avoid quantum decoherence, which happens when a quantum\
              \ system loses its quantum properties and starts behaving more like\
              \ a classical-computing system.\n![Circular, white maze filled with\
              \ white semicircles.] \n### Looking for direct answers to other complex\
              \ questions?\n[Explore the full McKinsey Explainers series] \nWhile\
              \ the problems that quantum computers can solve are impressive compared\
              \ with what current workaday computers can manage, they have limited\
              \ real-world applications. But we are rapidly approaching a time when\
              \ quantum computers*will*have a real impact on people’s lives.\n## What\
              \ are quantum computers used for?\nToday’s classical computers are relatively\
              \ straightforward. They work with a limited set of inputs and use an\
              \ algorithm to spit out an answer—and the bits that encode the inputs\
              \ do not share information about one another. Quantum computers are\
              \ different. For one, when data are input into the qubits, the qubits\
              \ interact with other qubits, allowing for many different calculations\
              \ to be run simultaneously; this is why quantum computers can work so\
              \ much faster than classical computers. But that’s not the end of the\
              \ story. Quantum computers don’t deliver just one clear answer like\
              \ classical computers do, but a range of possible answers.\nFor calculations\
              \ that are limited in scope, classical computers are still the preferred\
              \ tools. But for very complex problems, quantum computers can save time\
              \ by narrowing down the range of possible answers.\n## When will quantum\
              \ computers be available?\nOver the next few years, the major players\
              \ in quantum computing—as well as a small cohort of start-ups—will work\
              \ to steadily increase the number of qubits that their computers can\
              \ handle and improve how the technology functions. Progress in quantum\
              \ computing, however, is expected to remain a long-term race to achieve\
              \ the quantum volume that’s required to quickly solve real-world problems.\
              \ According to McKinsey’s conversations with tech executives, investors,\
              \ and academics in quantum computing, 72 percent believe we’ll see a[fully\
              \ fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2035]. The remaining 28 percent\
              \ think this milestone won’t be reached until 2040 or later.\nStill,\
              \ some businesses will begin to derive value from quantum well before\
              \ then. At first, businesses will receive quantum services via the cloud.\
              \ As we’ve seen, several major computing companies have already announced\
              \ their quantum cloud offerings.\n*[Learn more about McKinsey Digital]\
              \ *.\n## What’s the relationship between quantum computing and AI?\n\
              Quantum computing and[AI] have a[potentially symbiotic relationship],\
              \ and they stand to advance each other’s capabilities and respective\
              \ fields. Together, they might contribute to achieving[artificial general\
              \ intelligence (AGI)]. Here’s how each technology uses the other to[increase\
              \ efficiency]:\n* Quantum computing can help AI rapidly process extensive\
              \ data sets, thereby accelerating AI processes and training models.\
              \ Quantum computing can enable AI applications to achieve the following\
              \ milestones, which may eventually support AGI:\n* *enhanced computational\
              \ power*, enabling the rapid data processing and computations needed\
              \ for AGI\n* *more efficient problem-solving*, which boosts AI’s advanced\
              \ reasoning and decision-making\n* *improved learning capabilities*,\
              \ which are critical for AGI’s adaptability across diverse tasks and\
              \ environments\n* *parallel processing*, which improves information\
              \ analysis and synthesis\n* *easier handling of complex data structures*,\
              \ which provides AI with tools to process and understand intricate information\n\
              * *potential breakthroughs*in AI research\n* AI can enhance the development,\
              \ optimization, and practical applications of quantum computing. Here\
              \ are a few areas of quantum computing that could benefit from AI:\n\
              * *Error correction.*Machine learning predicts and corrects quantum\
              \ computation errors, improving quantum computers’ reliability.\n* *Noise\
              \ reduction.*AI can analyze noise patterns to develop reduction strategies.\n\
              * *Quantum-algorithm design and optimization.*Both of these processes\
              \ can happen via AI-like reinforcement learning.\n* *Quantum-hardware\
              \ control.*AI can automate quantum-device calibration and dynamically\
              \ adjust its control parameters.\n* *Resource management.*AI can help\
              \ allocate qubits efficiently and optimize the scheduling of quantum\
              \ tasks.\n* *Simulation and emulation.*AI can enhance quantum-system\
              \ simulations for algorithm and hardware testing, as well as aid research\
              \ by emulating quantum processes on classical hardware.\n* *Benchmarking\
              \ and performance analysis.*AI can develop sophisticated benchmarking\
              \ tools to evaluate and compare quantum devices and algorithms.\n* *Hybrid\
              \ quantum–classical systems.*AI can optimize the distribution of tasks\
              \ between classical and quantum processors, maximizing overall efficiency.\n\
              * *Quantum machine learning (QML).*AI can improve the training of QML\
              \ models by enhancing performance and applicability.## What are some\
              \ obstacles that may impede the development of quantum computing?\n\
              One major challenge in the advancement of quantum computing is the[volatility\
              \ of qubits]. Whereas a bit in today’s classical computers is in a state\
              \ of either one or zero, a qubit can be any possible combination of\
              \ the two. When a qubit changes its status, inputs can be lost or altered,\
              \ which throws off the accuracy of the results. Another obstacle to\
              \ development: For a quantum computer to operate at the scale that’s\
              \ needed to deliver significant breakthroughs, it will require potentially\
              \ millions of qubits to be connected. The few quantum computers that\
              \ exist today contain nowhere near that number of qubits.\nHere are\
              \ some other challenges to[scaling quantum computing technology]:\n\
              * *High-fidelity two-qubit gates at scale.*Maintaining “high fidelity”\
              \ (meaning a level of accuracy and reliability that’s greater than 99.99\
              \ percent) is required for fault-tolerant quantum computers. Doing so\
              \ at scale will be difficult.\n* *Speed.*Qubits need to retain their\
              \ quantum state to interact with one another. Even under specific environmental\
              \ conditions, they will eventually degrade.\n* *Multiqubit networking.*Connecting,\
              \ or networking, qubits to one another could theoretically make quantum\
              \ computers much more powerful. The key challenge here is connecting\
              \ qubits across chips, or from one physical quantum computer to another.\n\
              * *Individual qubit control at scale.*The control of individual qubits\
              \ becomes increasingly complex as the number of qubits in a given quantum\
              \ computer increases.\n* *Cooling power and environmental control.*As\
              \ quantum computers become larger, the size and power requirements of\
              \ the equipment to cool them become more and more costly, from both\
              \ a financial and an environmental standpoint. Currently, powering a\
              \ quantum computer large enough to connect millions of qubits is cost\
              \ prohibitive for most companies.\n* *Manufacturability.*Producing large\
              \ numbers of quantum computers will require automation of both the manufacturing\
              \ and testing processes. The production of certain quantum computers\
              \ may require developing entirely new manufacturing techniques.## How\
              \ can classical computers and quantum computers work together?\nSlowly,\
              \ at first. Initially,[quantum computing will be used alongside classical\
              \ computing] to solve multivariable problems. One example? Quantum computers\
              \ can narrow the range of possible solutions to a finance or logistics\
              \ problem, helping a company reach the best solution faster. This kind\
              \ of slower progress will be the norm until quantum computing advances\
              \ enough to deliver more significant breakthroughs.\n*[Learn more about\
              \ McKinsey Digital] *.\n## How can organizations find the quantum computing\
              \ talent they need?\nThere’s a wide gap between the business need for\
              \ quantum computing and the number of quantum professionals who are\
              \ available to meet it. This[talent and skills gap] could jeopardize\
              \ potential value creation, which McKinsey estimates to be as much as\
              \ $1.3 trillion.\nThe talent challenge is felt differently by companies\
              \ of different sizes. Small start-ups working in the quantum space typically\
              \ grow out of university research labs and often have direct access\
              \ to skilled candidates. Larger companies, though, might have less of\
              \ a connection to these talent pools.\nMcKinsey research has found that\
              \ there is only one qualified quantum candidate for every three quantum\
              \ job openings. According to McKinsey research, less than 50 percent\
              \ of quantum jobs in 2025 will be filled unless there are significant\
              \ changes to either the talent pool or the predicted rate of quantum\
              \ job creation.\nHere are[five lessons from the AI talent journey] that\
              \ can help organizations build the quantum talent they need:\n* *Define\
              \ your talent needs clearly.*In the early days of AI, some organizations\
              \ hired data scientists without a clear understanding of what skills\
              \ were needed. To avoid making the same mistake with quantum, organizations\
              \ should first identify possible fields of applications that a quantum\
              \ computing team would work on, then ensure that new hires come from\
              \ diverse areas of expertise.\n* *Invest early in translators.*As the\
              \ early buzz built up around AI, the role of analytics translators became\
              \ crucial to helping leaders identify and prioritize the business challenges\
              \ that AI was best suited to help solve. With quantum, there’s a similar\
              \ need: for translators with engineering, application, and scientific\
              \ backgrounds who can help organizations understand the opportunities\
              \ and identify the right players in this rapidly expanding ecosystem.\n\
              * *Create pathways for a diverse talent pipeline.*Many of the first\
              \ AI models reflected the same biases from the information that was\
              \ used to train them. Also common was a lack of diverse perspectives\
              \ and experiences among the people who built and tested the models,\
              \ which contributed to the bias issue. While it’s too early to know\
              \ all the risks that could emerge from quantum, we can expect similar\
              \ challenges if a diverse and empowered quantum workforce is not involved\
              \ with this new technology.\n* *Build technology literacy for all.*For\
              \ employees at all levels to make the best use of a new technology,\
              \ they need a basic understanding of how it works and what it can do.\
              \ With quantum, business leaders as well as workers up and down the\
              \ supply chain—in marketing, IT infrastructure, finance, and more—will\
              \ require basic fluency in quantum topics.\n* *Don’t forget talent development\
              \ strategies.*Companies tend to focus heavily on talent attraction during\
              \ times of technological foment, but that’s just one piece of the talent\
              \ puzzle. To retain specialists, companies need to carve out clear paths\
              \ for talent development. One pharmaceutical company leans into both\
              \ the purpose of its work—developing use cases that help save lives—and\
              \ the freedom it offers its team to choose which quantum-related questions\
              \ they work on and to collaborate with external experts and practitioners.##\
              \ What are potential business use cases for quantum computers?\nQuantum\
              \ computers have[four fundamental capabilities] that differentiate them\
              \ from today’s classical computers, all of which can be applied to a\
              \ business context:\n* *Quantum simulation.*Quantum computers can model\
              \ complex molecules, which may eventually help reduce development time\
              \ for chemical and pharmaceutical companies. When scientists are developing\
              \ new drugs, they need to examine the structure of a molecule to understand\
              \ how it will interact with other molecules. It’s almost impossible\
              \ for today’s computers to provide accurate simulations, because each\
              \ atom interacts with other atoms in complex ways. But experts believe\
              \ that quantum computers are powerful enough to eventually be able to\
              \ model even the most complex molecules in the human body. This opens\
              \ up the possibility for[faster development of new drugs] and new, transformative\
              \ cures.\n* *Optimization and search.*Every industry relies on optimization\
              \ in one way or another. Where are robots best placed on a factory floor?\
              \ What’s the shortest route for a company’s delivery trucks to travel?\
              \ There are myriad questions that need to be answered to optimize a\
              \ company’s efficiency and value creation. With classical computing,\
              \ companies must make one complicated calculation after another—a potentially\
              \ time-consuming and costly process, considering the many variables\
              \ in a given situation. Since a quantum computer is able to work with\
              \ multiple variables simultaneously, it can be used to[quickly narrow\
              \ the range of possible answers]. From there, classical computing can\
              \ be used to zero in on one precise answer.\n* *Quantum AI.*Quantum\
              \ computers have the potential to work with more advanced algorithms\
              \ that could transform[machine learning] across a diverse range of industries,\
              \ from automotive to pharmaceuticals. In particular, quantum computers\
              \ could accelerate the arrival of self-driving vehicles. Companies such\
              \ as Ford, GM, Volkswagen, and other mobility start-ups are running\
              \ video and image data through complex neural networks. Their goal?\
              \ To use AI to teach cars to make crucial driving decisions. Quantum\
              \ computers’ ability to perform multiple complex calculations with many\
              \ variables simultaneously allows for[faster training of such AI systems].\n\
              * *Prime factorization.*Today’s businesses use large, complex prime\
              \ numbers—numbers that are too big for classical computers to process—as\
              \ the basis for their encryption efforts. Using a process called prime\
              \ factorization, quantum computers will be able to use algorithms to\
              \ solve these complex prime numbers more easily than classical computers\
              \ can. (In fact, a quantum algorithm known as Shor’s algorithm can theoretically\
              \ do this; there’s just not a computer powerful enough to run it.) Once\
              \ quantum computers have advanced enough, new quantum-encryption technologies\
              \ will be needed to[protect online services] —and scientists are already\
              \ working on quantum cryptography to prepare for this eventuality. McKinsey\
              \ estimates quantum computers will be powerful enough for prime factorization\
              \ by the late 2020s at the very earliest.\nAs these capabilities develop\
              \ at pace with quantum computing power, additional use cases will likely\
              \ proliferate.\n## What are other quantum technologies aside from computing?\n\
              According to McKinsey’s analysis, quantum computing is still years away\
              \ from widespread commercial application. But[other quantum technologies]\
              \ such as[quantum communication] (QComm) and quantum sensing (QS) could\
              \ become available much earlier.\nQuantum communication will help enable\
              \ strong encryption protocols, which could greatly improve the security\
              \ of sensitive information and help in the following situations:\n*\
              \ *Full security.*QComm applications such as quantum-encryption protocols\
              \ and[quantum teleportation] help ensure complete protection when information\
              \ is transferred between locations. These protocols are more secure\
              \ than classical protocols, most of which are likely to be broken once\
              \ quantum computers attain more computing power or can work with more\
              \ efficient algorithms.\n* *Enhanced quantum computing power.*QComm\
              \ enables two important types of quantum processing: parallel quantum\
              \ processing (where multiple processors are connected and simultaneously\
              \ execute different calculations from the same problem) and blind quantum\
              \ computing (where quantum communications provide access to remote,\
              \ large-scale quantum computers in the cloud). Both types of processing\
              \ are made possible by the entanglement of quantum particles, when particles\
              \ such as qubits have connected properties (that is, one particle’s\
              \ properties can be manipulated by the actions done to another).\nQuantum\
              \ sensing allows for more accurate measurements than ever before, including\
              \ measurements of physical properties such as temperature, magnetic\
              \ fields, and rotation. Once quantum sensors are better optimized and\
              \ have decreased in size, they will be able to measure data that current\
              \ sensors are unable to capture.\nThe markets for QComm and QS are currently\
              \ smaller than the market for quantum computing, which has so far attracted\
              \ most of the headlines and funding. But McKinsey expects both QComm\
              \ and QS to attract serious interest and funding in the future. Although\
              \ investing in these quantum technologies is not without risk, the potential\
              \ payoff is high: By 2030, QComm and QS could generate $13 billion in\
              \ revenues.\n*[Learn more about McKinsey Digital] and check out[quantum\

              \ provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining\
              \ multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, in which the logical\
              \ error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However,\
              \ this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate\
              \ is below a critical threshold. Here we present two below-threshold\
              \ surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting\
              \ processors, Willow: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated\
              \ with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum\
              \ memory is suppressed by a factor of*Λ*= 2.14 ± 0.02 when increasing\
              \ the code distance by 2, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code\
              \ with 0.143% ± 0.003 per cent error per cycle of error correction.\
              \ This logical memory is also beyond breakeven, exceeding the lifetime\
              \ of its best physical qubit by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.3. Our system maintains\
              \ below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving\
              \ an average decoder latency of 63 microseconds at distance 5 up to\
              \ a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 microseconds. We also run\
              \ repetition codes up to distance 29 and find that logical performance\
              \ is limited by rare correlated error events, occurring approximately\
              \ once every hour or 3 × 109cycles. Our results indicate device performance\
              \ that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large-scale\
              \ fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.\n### Similar content being viewed\

              ## Main\nQuantum computing promises computational speed-ups in quantum\
              \ chemistry[5], quantum simulation[6], cryptography[7] and optimization[8].\
              \ However, quantum information is fragile and quantum operations are\
              \ error prone. State-of-the-art many-qubit platforms have only recently\
              \ demonstrated entangling gates with 99.9% fidelity[9],[10], far short\
              \ of the &lt;10−10error rates needed for many applications[11],[12].\
              \ Quantum error correction is postulated to realize high-fidelity logical\
              \ qubits by distributing quantum information for many entangled physical\
              \ qubits to protect against errors. If the physical operations are below\
              \ a critical noise threshold, the logical error rate should be suppressed\
              \ exponentially as we increase the number of physical qubits per logical\
              \ qubit. This behaviour is expressed in the approximate relation\n$${\\\
              \\varepsilon }\\_{d}\\\\propto {\\\\left(\\\\frac{p}{{p}\\_{{\\\\rm{thr}}}}\\\
              \\right)}^{(d+1)/2}$$\n(1)\nfor error-corrected surface code logical\
              \ qubits[3],[4],[13]. Here*d*is the code distance indicating 2*d*2− 1\
              \ physical qubits used per logical qubit;*p*and*ε**d*are the physical\
              \ and logical error rates, respectively; and*p*thris the threshold error\
              \ rate of the code. Thus, when*p*≪*p*thr, the error rate of the logical\
              \ qubit is suppressed exponentially in the distance of the code, with\
              \ the error suppression factor*Λ*=*ε**d*/*ε**d*+2≈*p*thr/*p*representing\
              \ the reduction in logical error rate when increasing the code distance\
              \ by two. Although many platforms have demonstrated different features\
              \ of quantum error correction[14],[15],[16],[17],[18],[19],[20], no\
              \ quantum processor has definitively shown below-threshold performance.\n\
              Although achieving below-threshold physical error rates is itself a\
              \ formidable challenge, fault-tolerant quantum computing also imposes\
              \ requirements beyond raw performance. These include features like stability\
              \ for the hours-long timescales of quantum algorithms[21] and the active\
              \ removal of correlated error sources like leakage[22]. Fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computing also imposes requirements on classical co-processors—namely,\
              \ the syndrome information produced by the quantum device must be decoded\
              \ as fast as it is generated[23]. The fast operation times of superconducting\
              \ qubits, ranging from tens to hundreds of nanoseconds, provide an advantage\
              \ in speed but also a challenge for decoding errors both quickly and\
              \ accurately.\nIn this work, we realize surface codes operating below\
              \ the threshold on two Willow processors. Using a 72-qubit processor,\
              \ we implement a distance-5 surface code operating with an integrated\
              \ real-time decoder. Subsequently, using a 105-qubit processor with\
              \ similar performance, we realize a distance-7 surface code. These processors\
              \ demonstrate*Λ*&gt; 2 up to distance 5 and 7, respectively. Our distance-5\
              \ and distance-7 quantum memories are beyond breakeven, with distance-7\
              \ preserving quantum information for more than twice as long as its\
              \ best constituent physical qubit. To identify possible logical error\
              \ floors, we also implement high-distance repetition codes on the 72-qubit\
              \ processor, with error rates that are dominated by correlated error\
              \ events occurring once an hour. These errors, the origins of which\
              \ are not yet understood, set a current error floor of 10−10in the repetition\
              \ code. Finally, we show that we can maintain below-threshold operation\
              \ on the 72-qubit processor even when decoding in real time, meeting\
              \ the strict timing requirements imposed by the fast 1.1 μs cycle duration\
              \ of the processor.\n## A surface code memory below threshold\nWe begin\
              \ with results from our 105-qubit Willow processor depicted in Fig.[1a].\
              \ It features a square grid of superconducting transmon qubits[24] with\
              \ improved operational fidelities compared with our previously reported\
              \ Sycamore processors[17],[25]. The qubits have a mean coherence time*T*1of\
              \ 68 μs and*T*2,CPMGof 89 μs, which we attribute to improved fabrication\
              \ techniques, participation ratio engineering and circuit parameter\
              \ optimization ([Supplementary Information]). Increasing coherence contributes\
              \ to the fidelity of all of our operations, which are displayed in Fig.[1b].\n\

              \ make several improvements to decoding, using two high-accuracy offline\
              \ decoders. One is a neural network decoder[26], and the other is a\
              \ harmonized ensemble[27] of correlated minimum-weight perfect matching\
              \ decoders[28] augmented with matching synthesis[29]. These run on different\
              \ classical hardware, offering two potential paths towards real-time\
              \ decoding with higher accuracy. To adapt to device noise, we fine-tune\
              \ the neural network with processor data[26] and apply reinforcement\
              \ learning optimization to the matching graph weights[30].\nWe operate\
              \ a distance-7 surface code memory comprising 49 data qubits, 48 measure\
              \ qubits and 4 additional leakage removal qubits[17]. Summarizing, we\
              \ initiate surface code operation by preparing the data qubits in a\
              \ product state corresponding to a logical eigenstate of either the*X*Lor*Z*Lbasis\
              \ of the*ZXXZ*surface code[31]. We then repeat a variable number of\
              \ cycles of error correction, during which the measured qubits extract\
              \ parity information from the data qubits to be sent to the decoder.\
              \ After each syndrome extraction, we run data qubit leakage removal\
              \ (DQLR)[32] to ensure that leakage to higher states is short-lived.\
              \ We measure the state of the logical qubit by measuring the individual\
              \ data qubits and then check whether the corrected logical measurement\
              \ outcome of the decoder agrees with the initial logical state. It is\
              \ worth noting that fault-tolerant computation does not require active\
              \ correction of the code state; the decoder can simply reinterpret the\
              \ logical measurement outcomes[13].\nFrom the surface code data, we\
              \ can characterize the physical error rate of the processor using the\
              \ bulk error detection probability[33]. This is the proportion of weight-4\
              \ stabilizer measurement comparisons that disagree with their ideal\
              \ noiseless comparisons, thereby detecting an error. The surface code\
              \ detection probabilities are*p*det= (7.7%, 8.5%, 8.7%) for*d*= (3,5,7),\
              \ respectively. We attribute the increase in detection probability with\
              \ code size to finite size effects ([Supplementary Information]) and\
              \ parasitic couplings between qubits. We expect both effects to saturate\
              \ at larger processor sizes[34].\nWe characterize the logical performance\
              \ of our surface code by fitting the logical error per cycle*ε**d*up\
              \ to 250 cycles, averaged over the*X*Land*Z*Lbases. We average the performance\
              \ of nine different distance-3 subgrids and four different distance-5\
              \ subgrids to compare with the distance-7 code. Finally, we compute*Λ*using\
              \ linear regression of ln[*ε**d*] versus*d*. With our neural network\
              \ decoder, we observe*Λ*= 2.14 ± 0.02 and*ε*7= (1.43 ± 0.03) × 10−3(Fig.[1c,d]).\
              \ With ensembled matching synthesis, we observe*Λ*= 2.04 ± 0.02 and*ε*7= (1.71 ± 0.03) × 10−3.\n\
              Furthermore, we simulate logical qubits of higher distances using a\
              \ noise model based on the measured component error rates in Fig.[1b],\
              \ additionally including leakage and stray interactions between qubits[17]\
              \ ([Supplementary Information]). These simulations are shown alongside\
              \ the experiment (Fig.[1d], inset), both decoded with ensembled matching\
              \ synthesis. We observe reasonable agreement with experiment and decisive\
              \ error suppression, affirming that the surface codes are operating\
              \ below threshold.\nThus far, we have focused on*Λ*, because below-threshold\
              \ performance guarantees that physical qubit lifetimes and operational\
              \ fidelities can be surpassed with a sufficiently large logical qubit.\
              \ In fact, our distance-7 logical qubit already has more than double\
              \ the lifetime of its constituent physical qubits. Although comparing\
              \ physical and logical qubits is subtle owing to their different noise\
              \ processes, we plot a direct comparison between logical error rate\
              \ and physical qubit error rate averaged over the*X*and*Z*basis initializations\
              \ (Fig.[1c]). To quantify the qubit lifetime itself, we uniformly average\
              \ over pure states using the metric proposed elsewhere[16] ([Supplementary\
              \ Information]). The distance-7 logical qubit lifetime is 291 ± 6 μs,\
              \ exceeding the lifetimes of all the constituent physical qubits (median,\
              \ 85 ± 7 μs; best, 119 ± 13 μs) by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.3. Our logical\
              \ memory beyond breakeven extends previous results using bosonic codes[16],[35],[36]\
              \ to multiqubit codes, and it is a critical step towards logical operation\
              \ breakeven.\n## Logical error sensitivity\nEquipped with below-threshold\
              \ logical qubits, we can now probe the sensitivity of logical error\
              \ to various error mechanisms in this new regime. We start by testing\
              \ how logical error scales with physical error and code distance. As\
              \ shown in Fig.[2a], we inject coherent errors with variable strengths\
              \ on both data and measure qubits, and extract two quantities from each\
              \ injection experiment. First, we use detection probability as a proxy\
              \ for the total physical error rate. Second, we infer the logical error\
              \ per cycle by measuring the logical error probability at ten cycles,\
              \ decoding with correlated matching[28].\n**Fig. 2: Error sensitivity\
              \ in the surface code.**\n[![figure 2]] \n**a**, One cycle of the surface\

              \ a 72-qubit processor is used.\n[Full size image] \nIn Fig.[2b], we\
              \ plot the logical error per cycle versus detection probability for\
              \ the distance-3, distance-5 and distance-7 codes. We find that the\
              \ three curves cross near a detection probability of 20%, roughly consistent\
              \ with the crossover regime explored elsewhere[17]. The inset further\
              \ shows that detection probability acts as a good proxy for 1/*Λ*(ref.[33]\
              \ and[Supplementary Information]). When fitting power laws below the\
              \ crossing, we observe approximately 80% of the ideal value (*d*+ 1)/2\
              \ predicted by equation ([1]). We hypothesize that this deviation is\
              \ caused by excess correlations in the device. Nevertheless, higher-distance\
              \ codes show a faster reduction in logical error, realizing the characteristic\
              \ threshold behaviour in situ on a quantum processor.\nTo quantify the\
              \ impact of correlated errors along with more typical gate errors, we\
              \ form an error budget. Using the method outlined elsewhere[17],[37],\
              \ we estimate the relative contribution of different component errors\
              \ to 1/*Λ*. We run simulations based on a detailed model of our 72-qubit\
              \ processor. The model includes local noise sources due to gates and\
              \ measurements, as well as two sources of correlated error: leakage,\
              \ and stray interactions between neighbouring qubits with our CZ gates\
              \ that can induce correlated*Z**Z*and swap-like errors ([Supplementary\
              \ Information]). Figure[2c] shows our estimated error budget for 1/*Λ*in\
              \ the 72-qubit processor when decoding with correlated matching. Applying\
              \ the same decoder to experimental data yields*Λ*= 1.97 ± 0.02. The\
              \ error budget overpredicts*Λ*by 14% (Fig.[2c], ‘excess’), indicating\
              \ that most but not all error effects in our processor have been captured.\
              \ Leakage and stray interactions make up an estimated 17% of the budget;\
              \ although not a dominant contributor, we expect their importance to\
              \ increase as the error rates decrease. Moreover, out-of-model long-range\
              \ interactions or high-energy leakage might contribute to the error\
              \ budget discrepancy. Overall, both local and correlated errors from\
              \ CZ gates are the largest contributors to the error budget. Consequently,\
              \ continuing to improve both coherence and calibration will be crucial\
              \ to further reduce logical error.\nOne potential source of excess correlations\
              \ that we actively mitigate is leakage to higher excited states of our\
              \ transmon qubits. During the logical qubit operation, we remove leakage\
              \ from measure qubits using multilevel reset. For data qubits, DQLR\
              \ swaps leakage excitations to measure qubits (or additional leakage\
              \ removal qubits)[32]. To examine sensitivity to leakage, we measure\
              \ logical error probability of distance-3 and distance-5 codes in our\
              \ 72-qubit processor with and without DQLR, and the results are shown\
              \ in Fig.[2d]. Although activating DQLR does not strongly affect the\
              \ distance-3 performance, it substantially boosts the distance-5 performance,\
              \ resulting in a 35% increase in*Λ*. Comparatively, the detection probability\
              \ decreases by only 12% ([Supplementary Information]), indicating that\
              \ the detection probability is only a good proxy for logical error suppression\
              \ if the errors are uncorrelated. Overall, we find that addressing leakage\
              \ is crucial for operating surface codes with transmon qubits[15],[32],[38].\n\
              Finally, we test the sensitivity to drift. Using our 72-qubit processor,\
              \ we measure the logical performance of one distance-5 and four distance-3\
              \ codes 16 times over 15 h, and the results are shown in Fig.[2e]. Before\
              \ the repeated runs, we use a frequency optimization strategy that forecasts\
              \ defect frequencies of two-level systems (TLSs). This helps to avoid\
              \ qubits coupling to TLSs during the initial calibration as well as\
              \ for the duration of the experiments. Between every four experimental\
              \ runs, we recalibrate the processor to account for potential qubit\
              \ frequency and readout signal drift. We observe an average*Λ*= 2.18 ± 0.07\
              \ (standard deviation) and best*Λ*= 2.31 ± 0.02 ([Supplementary Information])\
              \ when decoding with the neural network. Although the performance of\
              \ the worst distance-3 quadrant appears to fluctuate due to a transient\
              \ TLS moving faster than our forecasts, this fluctuation is suppressed\
              \ in the distance-5 code, suggesting that larger codes are less sensitive\
              \ to component-level fluctuations. Moreover, the logical error rates\
              \ of experiments right after drift recalibration are not appreciably\
              \ lower than those just prior, indicating that our logical qubit is\
              \ robust to the levels of qubit frequency and readout drift present.\
              \ These results indicate that superconducting processors can remain\
              \ stable for the hours-long timescales required for large-scale fault-tolerant\
              \ algorithms[21].\n## A repetition code memory in the ultralow-error\
              \ regime\nDespite realizing below-threshold surface codes, orders of\
              \ magnitude remain between present logical error rates and the requirements\
              \ for practical quantum computation. In previous work running repetition\
              \ codes, we found that high-energy impact events occurred approximately\
              \ once every 10 s, causing large correlated error bursts that manifested\
              \ a logical error floor of around 10−6(ref.[17]). Such errors would\
              \ block our ability to run error-corrected algorithms in the future,\
              \ motivating us to reassess repetition codes on our newer devices.\n\
              Using our 72-qubit processor, we run 2 × 107shots of a distance-29 repetition\
              \ code with 1,000 cycles of error correction, with the shots split evenly\
              \ between bit- and phase-flip codes. In total, we execute 2 × 1010cycles\
              \ of error correction comprising 5.5 h of processor execution time.\
              \ Given the logical error probability*p*Lat 1,000 cycles, we infer the\
              \ logical error per cycle as\\\\({\\\\varepsilon }\\_{d}=\\\\frac{1}{2}(1-{(1-2{p}\\\
              _{{\\\\rm{L}}})}^{1/1,000})\\\\). To assess how the logical error per\
              \ cycle scales with distance*d*, we follow ref.[37] and subsample lower-distance\
              \ repetition codes from the distance-29 data.\nAveraging over bit- and\
              \ phase-flip repetition codes, we obtain*Λ*= 8.4 ± 0.1 when fitting\
              \ logical error per cycle versus code distance between*d*= 5 and*d*= 11\
              \ (Fig.[3a]). Notably, the error per cycle on the 72-qubit processor\
              \ is suppressed far below 10−6, breaking past the error floor observed\
              \ previously. We attribute the mitigation of high-energy impact failures\
              \ to gap-engineered Josephson junctions[39]. However, at code distances\
              \ of*d*≥ 15, we observe a deviation from exponential error suppression\
              \ at high distances culminating in an apparent logical error floor of\
              \ 10−10. Although we do not observe any errors at distance 29, this\
              \ is probably due to randomly decoding correctly on the few most-damaging\
              \ error bursts. Although this logical error per cycle might permit certain\
              \ fault-tolerant applications[11], it is still many orders of magnitude\
              \ higher than expected and precludes larger fault-tolerant circuits[12],[21].\n\

              \ detection patterns for these high-distance logical failures, we observe\
              \ two different failure modes ([Supplementary Information]). The first\
              \ failure mode manifests as one or two detectors suddenly increasing\
              \ in the detection probability by more than a factor of 3, settling\
              \ to their initial detection probability tens or hundreds of cycles\
              \ later ([Supplementary Information]). These less-damaging failures\
              \ could be caused by transient TLSs appearing near the operation frequencies\
              \ of a qubit, or by coupler excitations, but might be mitigated using\
              \ methods similar to refs.[38],[40]. The second and more catastrophic\
              \ failure mode manifests as many detectors simultaneously experiencing\
              \ a larger spike in the detection probability; an example is shown in\
              \ Fig.[3b]. Notably, these anisotropic error bursts are spatially localized\
              \ to neighbourhoods of roughly 30 qubits (Fig.[3b], inset). Over the\
              \ course of our 2 × 1010cycles of error correction, our processor experienced\
              \ six of these large error bursts, which are responsible for the highest-distance\
              \ failures. These bursts, such as the event shown in Fig.[3b], are different\
              \ from previously observed high-energy impact events[17]. They occur\
              \ approximately once an hour, rather than once every few seconds, and\
              \ they decay with an exponential time constant of around 400 μs, rather\
              \ than tens of milliseconds. We do not yet understand the cause of these\
              \ events, but mitigating them remains vital to building a fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computer. These results reaffirm that long repetition codes\
              \ are a crucial tool for discovering new error mechanisms in quantum\
              \ processors at the logical noise floor. However, surface codes are\
              \ larger and sensitive to more errors than repetition codes; therefore,\
              \ these events may affect the surface code performance differently.\n\
              Furthermore, although we have tested the scaling law in equation ([1])\
              \ at low distances, repetition codes enable us to scan to higher distances\
              \ and lower logical errors. Using a similar coherent error injection\
              \ method as that in the surface code, we show the scaling of logical\
              \ error versus physical error and code distance in Fig.[3c,d], observing\
              \ good agreement with*O*(*p*(*d*+1)/2) error suppression. For example,\
              \ reducing the detection probability by a factor of 2 manifests in reduction\
              \ by a factor of 250 in logical error at distance 15, consistent with\
              \ the expected*O*(*p*8) scaling. This shows the considerable error suppression\
              \ that should eventually enable large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers,\
              \ provided we can reach similar error suppression factors in surface\
              \ codes.\n## Real-time decoding\nAlong with a high-fidelity processor,\
              \ fault-tolerant quantum computing also requires a classical co-processor\
              \ that can decode errors in real time. This is because some logical\
              \ operations are non-deterministic; they depend on logical measurement\
              \ outcomes that must be correctly interpreted on the fly. If the decoder\
              \ cannot process measurements fast enough, an increasing backlog of\
              \ syndrome information can cause an exponential increase in computation\
              \ time[23]. Real-time decoding is particularly challenging for superconducting\
              \ processors due to their speed. The throughput of transmitting, processing\
              \ and decoding the syndrome information in each cycle must keep pace\
              \ with the fast error-correcting cycle time of 1.1 μs. Using our 72-qubit\
              \ processor as a platform, we demonstrate below-threshold performance\
              \ alongside this vital module in the fault-tolerant quantum computing\
              \ stack.\nOur decoding system begins with our classical control electronics,\
              \ where the measurement signals are classified into bits and then transmitted\
              \ to a specialized workstation using low-latency Ethernet. Inside the\
              \ workstation, measurements are converted into detections and then streamed\
              \ to the real-time decoding software using a shared memory buffer. We\
              \ use the sparse blossom algorithm[41], which is optimized to quickly\
              \ resolve the local configurations of errors common in surface code\
              \ decoding, using a parallelization strategy similar to that in ref.[42].\
              \ The decoder operates on a constant-sized graph buffer that emulates\
              \ the section of the error graph being decoded at any instant, but does\
              \ not grow with the total number of cycles used in the experiment. Different\
              \ threads are responsible for different spacetime regions of the graph,\
              \ processing their requisite syndrome information as it is streamed\
              \ in[42],[43],[44],[45]. These results are fused until a global minimum-weight\
              \ perfect matching is found. The streaming decoding algorithm is illustrated\
              \ in Fig.[4a,b]. We also use a greedy edge reweighting strategy to increase\
              \ the accuracy by accounting for correlations induced by*Y*-type errors[28],[46].\n\
              **Fig. 4: Real-time decoding.**\n[![figure 4]] \n**a**, Schematic of\
              \ the streaming decoding algorithm. The decoding problems are subdivided\
              \ into blocks, with different threads responsible for different blocks.**b**,\
              \ Task graph for processing blocks. Detections are enabled to match\
              \ to the block boundaries, which will then be processed downstream during\
              \ a fuse step. If a configuration of detection events cannot be resolved\
              \ by a future fuse step, the decoder heralds failure. We use ten-cycle\
              \ blocks to ensure that the heralded failure rate is negligible compared\
              \ with the logical failure rate.**c**, Decoder latency versus experiment\
              \ duration. Each blue point corresponds to a latency measurement for\
              \ a full shot (ten shots per duration; horizontal bar, median; blue\
              \ shading, violin plot). The yellow histograms represent fine-grained\
              \ latency measurements of the time between receiving data and completing\
              \ decoding for each ten-cycle block in a shot. The values from these\
              \ fine-grained measurements, which we refer to as subshot latencies,\
              \ tend to be slightly larger than those from full-shot latency measurements\
              \ as the decoder may need to wait to fuse with detection events in future\
              \ cycles. Infrequently, we see brief subshot latency spikes above 1 ms\
              \ ([Supplementary Information]).**d**, Accuracy comparison for the surface\
              \ code with three decoders. We include the real-time decoder (RT), ensembled\
              \ matching synthesis (Ens.) and the neural network decoder (NN). Uncertainty\
              \ on each point is less than 4 × 10−4([Supplementary Information]).\
              \ To obtain the data in this figure, a 72-qubit processor is used.\n\
              [Full size image] \nIn Fig.[4c], we report the decoder latency, which\
              \ we define as the time between the decoding software receiving the\
              \ final cycle of syndrome measurements and the time at which the decoder\
              \ returns its correction. For our distance-5 surface code, we test different\
              \ problem sizes by increasing the number of error correction cycles\
              \ up to 106. We observe that the average decoder latency remains roughly\
              \ constant at a net average of 63 ± 17 μs independent of the length\
              \ of the experiment (up to 1.1 s), indicating that the decoding problem\
              \ is being processed in real time. This latency will eventually lower\
              \ bound the reaction time of the logical processor when enacting non-Clifford\
              \ gates. Other contributions to the reaction time include the data transmission\
              \ time (which we estimate to be less than 10 μs) and feedback (which\
              \ we have not yet implemented). Moreover, our decoder latency scales\
              \ with the code size, underscoring the need for further optimization.\n\
              Importantly, we are able to maintain below-threshold performance even\
              \ under the strict timing requirements imposed by real-time decoding.\
              \ We run a dedicated experiment on our 72-qubit processor to compare\
              \ real-time decoding to high-accuracy offline neural network decoding\
              \ of the same data, with the results shown in Fig.[4d]. Our real-time\
              \ decoder achieves*ε*5= 0.35% ± 0.01% and*Λ*= 2.0 ± 0.1 using a device-data-independent\
              \ prior. Meanwhile, the neural network decoder achieves*ε*5= 0.269% ± 0.008%\
              \ and*Λ*= 2.18 ± 0.09 when later decoding offline. The modest reduction\
              \ in accuracy when comparing the real-time decoder with an offline decoder\
              \ is expected as the real-time decoder must operate substantially faster.\
              \ It requires a throughput of less than 1.1 μs per cycle compared with\
              \ the 24 μs per cycle of the neural network[26]. However, we expect\
              \ that many of our high-accuracy decoding methods can eventually be\
              \ made real time by introducing techniques like layered or windowed\
              \ decoding[27],[43],[44].\n## Outlook\nIn this work, we have demonstrated\
              \ surface code memory below the threshold in our new Willow architecture.\
              \ Each time the code distance increases by two, the logical error per\
              \ cycle is reduced by more than half, culminating in a distance-7 logical\
              \ lifetime of more than double its best constituent physical qubit lifetime.\
              \ This signature of exponential logical error suppression with code\
              \ distance forms the foundation of running large-scale quantum algorithms\
              \ with error correction.\nOur error-corrected processors also demonstrate\
              \ other key advances towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. We achieve\
              \ repeatable performance for more than several hours and run experiments\
              \ up to 106cycles without deteriorating performance, both of which are\
              \ necessary for future large-scale fault-tolerant algorithms. Furthermore,\
              \ we have engineered a real-time decoding system with only a modest\
              \ reduction in accuracy compared with our offline decoders.\nEven so,\
              \ many challenges remain ahead of us. Although we might, in principle,\
              \ achieve low logical error rates by scaling up our current processors,\
              \ it would be resource intensive in practice. Extrapolating the projections\
              \ shown in Fig.[1d], achieving a 10−6error rate would require a distance-27\
              \ logical qubit using 1,457 physical qubits. Scaling up will bring additional\
              \ challenges in real-time decoding as the syndrome measurements per\
              \ cycle increase quadratically with the code distance. Our repetition\
              \ code experiments also identify a noise floor at an error rate of 10−10caused\
              \ by correlated bursts of errors. Identifying and mitigating this error\
              \ mechanism will be integral to running larger quantum algorithms.\n\
              However, quantum error correction also provides us exponential leverage\
              \ in reducing logical errors with processor improvements. For example,\
              \ reducing physical error rates by a factor of two would improve the\
              \ distance-27 logical performance by four orders of magnitude, well\
              \ into algorithmically relevant error rates[11],[12]. We further expect\
              \ these overheads to reduce with advances in error correction protocols[47],[48],[49],[50],[51],[52],[53]\
              \ and decoding[54],[55],[56].\nThe purpose of quantum error correction\
              \ is to enable large-scale quantum algorithms. Although this work focuses\
              \ on building a robust memory, additional challenges will arise in logical\
              \ computation[57],[58]. On the classical side, we must ensure that software\
              \ elements including our calibration protocols, real-time decoders and\
              \ logical compilers can scale to the sizes and complexities needed to\
              \ run multiple surface code operations[59]. With below-threshold surface\
              \ codes, we have demonstrated processor performance that can scale in\
              \ principle, but which we must now scale in practice.\n## Data availability\n\

              * Link\nSANTA BARBARA, California, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Google[(GOOGL.O),\
              \ opens new tab] on Monday said that it has overcome a key challenge\
              \ in quantum computing with a new generation of chip, solving a computing\
              \ problem in five minutes that would take a classical computer more\
              \ time than the history of the universe.\nLike other tech giants such\
              \ as Microsoft[(MSFT.O), opens new tab] and International Business Machines[(IBM.N),\
              \ opens new tab], Alphabet&#x27;s Google is chasing quantum computing\
              \ because it promises computing speeds far faster than today&#x27;s\
              \ fastest systems. While the math problem solved by the company&#x27;s\
              \ Santa Barbara, California quantum lab does not have commercial applications,\
              \ Google hopes quantum computers will one day solve problems in medicine,\
              \ battery chemistry and artificial intelligence that are out of reach\
              \ for today&#x27;s computers.\nSign up[here.] \nThe results released\
              \ Monday came from a new chip called Willow that has 105 &quot;qubits,&quot;\
              \ which are the building blocks of quantum computers. Qubits are fast\
              \ but error-prone, because they can be jostled by something as small\
              \ as a subatomic particle from events in outer space.\nAs more qubits\
              \ are packed onto a chip, those errors can add up to make the chip no\
              \ better than a conventional computer chip. So since the 1990s, scientists\
              \ have been working on quantum error-correction.\nIn a paper published\
              \ in the journal Nature on Monday, Google said that it has found a way\
              \ to string together the Willow chip&#x27;s qubits so that error rates\
              \ go down as the number of qubits goes up. The company also says it\
              \ can correct errors in real time, a key step toward making its quantum\
              \ machines practical.\nItem 1 of 4 A person shows Google Quantum AI&#x27;s\

              \ Neven, who leads the Google Quantum AI unit, said in an interview.\n\
              In 2019, IBM challenged Google&#x27;s claim that Google&#x27;s quantum\
              \ chip solved a problem that would take a classical computer 10,000\
              \ years, saying the problem could be solved in two-and-a-half days using\
              \ different technical assumptions about a classical system.\nIn a blog\
              \ post Monday, Google said it took some of those concerns into account\
              \ in its newest estimates. Even under the most idealistic conditions,\
              \ Google said a classical computer would still take a billion years\
              \ to get the same results as its newest chip.\nSome of Google&#x27;s\
              \ rivals are producing chips with[a larger number of qubits] than Google,\
              \ but Google is focused on making the most reliable qubits it can, Anthony\
              \ Megrant, chief architect for Google Quantum AI, said in an interview.\n\
              Google fabricated its previous chips in a shared facility at the University\
              \ of California, Santa Barbara, but built its own dedicated fabrication\
              \ facility to produce its Willow chips. Megrant said that new facility\
              \ will speed up how fast Google can make future chips, which are chilled\
              \ in huge refrigerators called cryostats to run experiments.\n&quot;If\
              \ we have a good idea, we want somebody on the team to be able to ...\
              \ get that into the clean room and into one of these cryostats as fast\
              \ as possible, so we can get lots of cycles of learning,&quot; Megrant\
              \ said.\nReporting by Stephen Nellis in Santa Barbara, California; editing\

              \ byEmma Roth] \nis a news writer who covers the streaming wars, consumer\
              \ tech, crypto, social media, and much more. Previously, she was a writer\
              \ and editor at MUO.\nGoogle&rsquo;s quantum computing lab just achieved\
              \ a major milestone. On Monday,[the company revealed] that its new quantum\
              \ computing chip, Willow, is capable of performing a computing challenge\
              \ in less than five minutes &mdash; a process Google says would take\
              \ one of the world&rsquo;s fastest supercomputers 10 septillion years,\
              \ or longer than the age of the universe.\nThat&rsquo;s a big jump from\
              \ 2019 when Google announced its[quantum processor could complete] a\
              \ mathematical equation in three minutes, as opposed to 10,000 years\
              \ on a supercomputer. IBM[disputed the claim] at the time.\nAlong with\
              \ more powerful performance, researchers also found a way to reduce\
              \ errors, something Google calls &ldquo;one of the greatest challenges\
              \ in quantum computing.&rdquo; Instead of bits, which represent either\
              \ 1 or 0, quantum computing uses qubits,[a unit that can exist in multiple\
              \ states] at the same time, such as 1, 0, and anything in between.\n\
              As noted by Google, qubits are prone to errors because they &ldquo;have\
              \ a tendency to rapidly exchange information with their environment.&rdquo;\
              \ However, Google&rsquo;s researchers discovered a way to reduce errors\
              \ by introducing more qubits to a system and were able to correct them\
              \ in real time. Their findings were[published in*Nature*].\n&ldquo;This\
              \ historic accomplishment is known in the field as &lsquo;below threshold&rsquo;\
              \ &mdash; being able to drive errors down while scaling up the number\
              \ of qubits,&rdquo; Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven writes on\
              \ Google&rsquo;s blog. &ldquo;You must demonstrate being below threshold\
              \ to show real progress on error correction, and this has been an outstanding\

              \ best-in-class performance,&rdquo; according to Neven.[Microsoft],[Amazon],\
              \ and[IBM] are working on quantum computing systems of their own.\n\
              Google&rsquo;s next goal is to perform a first &ldquo;useful, beyond-classical&rdquo;\
              \ computation that is both &ldquo;relevant to a real-world application&rdquo;\
              \ and one that typical computers can&rsquo;t achieve. Going forward,\

              \nBy [Cade Metz] \n\nCade Metz has written about quantum computing since\
              \ the 1990s.\n\n- Dec. 9, 2024\n\n[Leer en español] \n\nIn 2019, a team\
              \ of Google researchers [said] they had built a machine capable of performing\
              \ tasks that were not possible with traditional supercomputers. They\
              \ described this machine, called a quantum computer, as a turning point\
              \ in the evolution of information technology.\n\nSome scientists disputed\
              \ the claim. In the years since, as traditional supercomputers grew\
              \ more powerful, they matched the feats of Google’s quantum computer.\n\
              \nOn Monday, Google unveiled a new quantum computer that may end this\
              \ back-and-forth race with traditional machines and that points to a\
              \ future in which quantum computers could drive advances in areas like\
              \ drug discovery and artificial intelligence.\n\nGoogle said its quantum\
              \ computer, based on a computer chip called Willow, needed less than\
              \ five minutes to perform a mathematical calculation that one of the\
              \ world’s most powerful supercomputers could not complete in 10 septillion\
              \ years, a length of time that exceeds the age of the known universe.\n\

              Using a novel double-transmon coupler, researchers have attained gate\
              \ fidelities up to 99.98%, paving the way for more reliable and scalable\
              \ quantum computing. Credit: SciTechDaily.com\n\n**Researchers have\
              \ achieved high gate fidelities up to 99.98% using a new double-transmon\
              \ coupler. This development enhances quantum computing performance and\
              \ supports the advancement toward fault-tolerant systems.**\n\nResearchers\
              \ from the RIKEN Center for Quantum Computing and Toshiba have developed\
              \ a quantum computer gate using a double-transmon coupler (DTC), a device\
              \ previously proposed in theory to enhance the fidelity of quantum gates\
              \ significantly. With this innovation, the team achieved a fidelity\
              \ of 99.92% for a two-qubit device known as a CZ gate and 99.98% for\
              \ a single-qubit gate.\n\nThis milestone, part of the Q-LEAP project,\
              \ not only improves the performance of noisy intermediate-scale quantum\
              \ (NISQ) devices but also lays the groundwork for fault-tolerant quantum\
              \ computation through more effective error correction.\n\n#### Enhanced\
              \ Gate Fidelity With DTC\n\nThe DTC is a novel tunable coupler comprising\
              \ two fixed-frequency transmons—a type of qubit designed to be less\
              \ sensitive to noise caused by charge—connected through a loop containing\
              \ an additional Josephson junction. This architecture addresses a critical\
              \ challenge in quantum computing: achieving high-fidelity connections\
              \ between qubits. High fidelity is crucial for reducing errors and increasing\
              \ the reliability of quantum computations.\n\nThe DTC stands out by\
              \ minimizing residual interactions while enabling fast, high-fidelity\
              \ two-qubit gate operations, even for qubits with significant frequency\
              \ differences (detuning). While single-qubit gates have reached fidelity\
              \ levels of 99.9%, two-qubit gates have typically had error rates of\
              \ 1% or more, primarily due to unwanted qubit interactions, such as\
              \ the ZZ interaction. The DTC approach directly tackles these issues,\
              \ representing a major advance in quantum gate technology.\n\n**False\
              \ color picture of the device.** The black holes are superconducting\
              \ through-silicon vias (TSVs) distributed throughout the chip. The three\
              \ panels at the bottom are magnified pictures of the areas (dotted rectangles)\
              \ containing Josephson junctions. Credit: RIKEN\n\n#### Optimizing Quantum\
              \ Error Correction\n\nA key of the current work, published in _Physical\
              \ Review X_, is the construction of a gate using state-of-the-art fabrication\
              \ techniques using a type of machine learning known as reinforcement\
              \ learning. This approach allowed the researchers to translate the theoretical\
              \ potential of the DTC into practical application. They used this approach\
              \ to achieve a balance between two types of remaining error—leakage\
              \ error and decoherence error—that remained within the system, selecting\
              \ a length of 48 nanoseconds as an optimal compromise between the two\
              \ error sources. Thanks to this, they were able to achieve fidelity\
              \ levels that are among the highest reported in the field.\n\n#### Future\
              \ Prospects in Quantum Technology\n\nAccording to Yasunobu Nakamura,\
              \ director of the RIKEN Center for Quantum Computing, “By reducing the\
              \ error rates in quantum gates, we have made more reliable and accurate\
              \ quantum computations possible. This is particularly important for\
              \ the development of fault-tolerant quantum computers, which are the\
              \ future of quantum computing.”\n\nHe continues, “This device’s ability\
              \ to perform effectively with highly detuned qubits makes it a versatile\
              \ and competitive building block for various quantum computing architectures.\
              \ This adaptability ensures that it can be integrated into existing\
              \ and future superconducting quantum processors, enhancing their overall\
              \ performance and scalability. In the future, we plan to try to achieve\
              \ a shorter gate length, as this could help minimize the incoherent\
              \ error.”\n\nReference: “Realization of High-Fidelity CZ Gate Based\

              \ and Quantinuum were able to create four highly reliable logical qubits\
              \ from only 30 physical qubits, while demonstrating an 800x improvement\
              \ in error rate.*\nA hybrid supercomputer that combines both classical\
              \ and quantum capabilities has the potential to solve formerly intractable\
              \ problems and address the most pressing global issues. When powered\
              \ by 100 reliable logical qubits, a hybrid machine could potentially\
              \ solve scientific problems that are unsolvable on classical machines.\
              \ To make this potential a reality, scientific and engineering breakthroughs\
              \ are required. Today, Microsoft is announcing a critical breakthrough\

              \ date.\n## Physical and logical qubits\nQuantum computing uses qubits\
              \ to store and process information. However, today’s qubits are prone\
              \ to errors that limit their usefulness and the practicality of all\
              \ noisy, intermediate-scale quantum computers. There are two approaches\
              \ for reducing these errors:\n1. Improve the quality of the physical\
              \ qubits and their operation.\n2. Use advanced techniques to combine\
              \ multiple physical qubits into more reliable virtual qubits, which\
              \ are often referred to as logical qubits.\nMerely increasing the number\
              \ of physical qubits with a high error rate—without improving that error\
              \ rate—is futile because doing so would result in a large quantum computer\
              \ that is not any more powerful than before. In contrast, when physical\
              \ qubits with sufficient quality of operation are used with a specialized\
              \ orchestration-and-diagnostics system to enable virtual qubits, only\
              \ then does increasing the number of physical qubits result in powerful,\
              \ fault-tolerant quantum computers able to perform longer, more complex\
              \ computation.\n## Using qubit virtualization to create highly reliable\
              \ logical qubits\nThe results presented here were achieved by coupling\
              \ Microsoft’s qubit-virtualization system with Quantinuum’s specialized\
              \ hardware. Quantinuum’s H-Series[ion-trap qubits] and unique Quantum\
              \ Charged Coupled Device architecture have an excellent two-qubit gate\
              \ fidelity of 99.8%. By applying our qubit-virtualization system to\
              \ their qubits, we have been able to run 14,000 independent instances\
              \ so far without a single error. Oursophisticated system haserrordiagnostics\
              \ and corrections built in, allowing us to easily determine which errors\
              \ needto be fixed and how to fix them.\nWith our qubit-virtualization\
              \ system, we were able to create four highly reliable logical qubits\
              \ from only 30 physical qubits of the available 32 on Quantinuum’s machine.\
              \ When entangled, these logical qubits exhibited a circuit error rate\
              \ of 10-5or 0.00001, which means they would experience an error only\
              \ once in every 100,000 runs. That is an 800x improvement over the circuit\
              \ error rate of 8×10-3or 0.008, measured from entangled physical qubits.\
              \ This result was achieved through a combination of advanced runtime\
              \ error diagnostics with computational run rejection and error correction.\
              \ You can read more about our[methods and results].\n**An 800x improvement\
              \ in error rate corresponds to a 29 dB improvement of signal, which\
              \ is the same as that achieved with a high-quality noise-canceling headset**.\
              \ To expand on that analogy, the environmental noise that exists on\
              \ an airplane represents the noise level that the physical qubits exhibit.\
              \ Activating the noise-canceling function on the headphones to listen\
              \ to music, while removing most of the environmental noise, is akin\
              \ to applying our qubit-virtualization system.****\nThe 800x improvement\
              \ was made possible through advances in Microsoft’s fault-tolerance\
              \ protocols, which have been developed by our team over many years and\
              \ involve careful design and optimization to greatly reduce both the\
              \ number of physical qubits and the physical operations needed to produce\
              \ reliable logical qubits. These results will improve further as we\
              \ continue to optimize our methods.\n## Microsoft and Quantinuum\nAdvancing\
              \ the field of quantum computing\n[Read the full paper] \n![Two people\
              \ working together looking at computer screen] \n## Demonstration of\
              \ active syndrome extraction\nWith the logical qubits we created, we\
              \ were able to successfully perform multiple active syndrome extractions,\
              \ which is when errors are diagnosed and corrected*without*destroying\
              \ the logical qubits. Syndrome extraction is important because it permits\
              \ longer and more complex computation to proceed without failure, which\
              \ is necessary to achieve fault-tolerant quantum computing.\n## Reliable\
              \ quantum computing\n[Three fundamental criteria] to advance from noisy,\
              \ intermediate-scale quantum computing to reliable quantum computing\
              \ are:\n1. Achieve a large separation between logical and physical error\
              \ rates.\n2. Correct all individual circuit errors.\n3. Generate entanglement\
              \ between at least two logical qubits.\nWe have demonstrated, forthe\
              \ first time on record, that all three of the above criteria have been\
              \ met. For the first criterion, we achieved an 800x improvement in logical\
              \ error rate compared to the physical error rate. To quantify this 800x\
              \ improvement, we entangled qubits and performed runtime error diagnostics\
              \ and error corrections on the measurements (as seen in Figures 1 and\
              \ 2), thus satisfying the second and third criteria.\nIn addition to\
              \ meeting the three criteria above, we have demonstrated several rounds\
              \ of active syndrome extraction on two logical qubits, which marks the\
              \ transition to reliable quantum computing. This achievement is a prerequisite\
              \ for building a hybrid classical-quantum supercomputer that outperforms\
              \ even the most powerful classical computers.\n![A depiction of the\
              \ preparation used to entangle qubits] **Figure 1**: A depiction of\
              \ the preparation we used to entangle qubits. The portion inside the\
              \ dashed line is a rough representation of the circuit used to create\
              \ the entangled state.**A**and**B**represent measurements that can be\
              \ applied to each half of the state. In the absence of errors, the outcome\
              \ on one half should agree with the outcome on the other half, if the\
              \ types of measurement applied to each half are the same. Impressively,\
              \ after this procedure was run 14,000 times, there were no disagreements\
              \ between the measurement outcomes.\n![An animation showing the discrepancies\
              \ or errors between entangled pairs of qubits] **Figure 2**: The discrepancies\
              \ (errors) between entangled qubits. Discrepancies are revealed by comparing\
              \ the images from each qubit in a pair, and any differences that exist\
              \ appear as dots in the central image between each pair. Errors exist\
              \ between pairs of physical qubits, as evidenced by the dots in the\
              \ central images of the top row. In contrast, no errors remain between\
              \ entangled logical qubits, as apparent from the lack of dots in the\
              \ central images in the lower row.\nNot all logical qubits have the\
              \ same degree of usefulness and only those with very low error rates,\
              \ such as those reported here, may reliably perform non-trivial computations.\
              \ Integrating these highly reliable logical qubits, created with Quantinuum’s\
              \ hardware and our qubit-virtualization system, into[Azure Quantum Elements]\
              \ will provide a truly hybrid computing experience to users—one that\
              \ combines the power of cloud high-performance computing with advanced\
              \ AI models and improved quantum-computing capabilities.\nAchieving\
              \ reliable quantum computing is a notable milestone and will enable\
              \ new capabilities and scientific discoveries as Microsoft’s qubit-virtualization\
              \ system continues to improve. As we take advantage of these opportunities,\
              \ we will continue to invest in technology that can scale to the level\
              \ of hybrid supercomputing, which will require logical qubits that experience\
              \ much less than one error for every 100 million operations. A hybrid\
              \ supercomputer that combines classical and quantum capabilities could\
              \ solve commercially significant problems that are far too complex for\
              \ classical computers. To reach this level of quantum computing, Microsoft\
              \ is developing a qubit with built-in error protection and digital control\

              ### **A purpose-built computing platform for science**\nMany of the\
              \ hardest problems facing society, such as reversing climate change,\
              \ addressing food insecurity and solving the energy crisis, are chemistry\
              \ and materials science problems. However, the number of possible stable\
              \ molecules and materials may surpass the number of atoms in the observable\
              \ universe. Even a billion years of classical computing would be insufficient\
              \ to explore and evaluate them all.\nThat’s why the promise of quantum\
              \ is so appealing. Scaled quantum computers would offer the ability\
              \ to simulate the interactions of molecules and atoms at the quantum\
              \ level beyond the reach of classical computers, unlocking solutions\
              \ that can be a catalyst for positive change in our world. But quantum\
              \ computing is just one layer for driving these breakthrough insights.\n\
              Whether it’s to[supercharge pharma productivity] or[pioneer the next\
              \ sustainable battery], accelerating scientific discovery requires a\
              \ purpose-built, hybrid compute platform. Researchers need access to\
              \ the right tool at the right stage of their discovery pipeline to efficiently\
              \ solve every layer of their scientific problem and drive insights into\
              \ where they matter most. This is what we built with[Azure Quantum Elements],\
              \ empowering organizations to transform research and development with\
              \ capabilities including screening massive data sets with AI, narrowing\
              \ down options with high-performance computing (HPC) or improving model\
              \ accuracy with the power of scaled quantum computing in the future.\n\
              We continue to advance the state-of-the-art across all these hybrid\
              \ technologies for our customers, with today’s quantum milestone laying\
              \ the foundation for useful, reliable and scalable simulations of quantum\
              \ mechanics.\n### **Moving toward resilience**\nIn an[article I wrote\
              \ on LinkedIn], I used a ‘leaky boat’ analogy to explain why fidelity\
              \ and error correction are so important to quantum computing. In short,\
              \ fidelity is the value we use to measure how reliably a quantum computer\
              \ can produce a meaningful result. Only with good fidelity will we have\
              \ a solid foundation to reliably scale a quantum machine that can solve\
              \ practical, real-world problems.\nFor years, one approach used to fix\
              \ this leaky boat has been to increase the number of noisy physical\
              \ qubits together with techniques to compensate for that noise but falling\
              \ short of real logical qubits with superior error correction rates.\
              \ The main shortcoming of most of today’s NISQ machines is that the\
              \ physical qubits are too noisy and error-prone to make robust quantum\
              \ error correction possible. Our industry’s foundational components\
              \ are not good enough for quantum error correction to work, and it’s\
              \ why even larger NISQ systems are not practical for real-world applications.\n\
              The task at hand for the entire quantum ecosystem is to increase the\
              \ fidelity of qubits and enable fault-tolerant quantum computing so\
              \ that we can use a quantum machine to unlock solutions to previously\
              \ intractable problems. In short, we need to transition to reliable\
              \ logical qubits —created by combining multiple physical qubits together\
              \ into logical ones to protect against noise and sustain a long (i.e.,\
              \ resilient) computation. We can only obtain this with careful hardware\
              \ and software co-design. By having high-quality hardware components\
              \ and breakthrough error-handling capabilities designed for that machine,\
              \ we can get better results than any individual component could give\
              \ us. Today, we’ve done just that.\n> “Breakthroughs in quantum error\
              \ correction and fault tolerance are important for realizing the long-term\
              \ value of quantum computing for scientific discovery and energy security.\
              \ Results like these enable continued development of quantum computing\
              \ systems for research and development.”\n> **> Dr. Travis Humble, Director,\
              \ Quantum Science Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory\n**\n### **A\

              \ a historic moment:**for the first time on record as an industry, we’re\
              \ advancing from Level 1 Foundational to**[**Level 2 Resilient quantum\
              \ computing**]. We’re now entering the next phase for solving meaningful\
              \ problems with reliable quantum computers. Our qubit-virtualization\
              \ system, which filters and corrects errors, combined with Quantinuum’s\
              \ hardware demonstrates the**largest gap between physical and logical\
              \ error rates reported to date**. This is the first demonstrated system\
              \ with four logical qubits that improves the logical over the physical\
              \ error rate by such a large order of magnitude.\n[![Graphic demonstrating\
              \ the largest gap between physical and logical error rates yet detected]]\
              \ We’ve been able to demonstrate the largest gap between physical and\
              \ logical error rates yet detected —far below the break-even point,\
              \ now within a regime where quantum error correction is valuable and\
              \ works.\nAs importantly, we’re also now able to diagnose and correct\
              \ errors in the logical qubits without destroying them*—*referred to\
              \ as “active syndrome extraction.” This represents a huge step forward\
              \ for the industry as it enables more reliable quantum computation.\n\
              With this system, we ran more than 14,000 individual experiments without\

              At Microsoft, our mission is to empower every individual and organization\
              \ to achieve more. We’ve brought the world’s best NISQ hardware to the\
              \ cloud with our Azure Quantum platform so our customers can embark\
              \ on their quantum journey. This is why we’ve integrated artificial\
              \ intelligence with quantum computing and cloud HPC in the private preview\
              \ of Azure Quantum Elements. We used this platform to design and demonstrate\
              \ an end-to-end workflow that integrates Copilot, Azure compute and\
              \ a quantum algorithm running on Quantinuum processors to train an AI\
              \ model for property prediction.\nToday’s announcement continues this\
              \ commitment by advancing quantum hardware to Level 2. Advanced capabilities\
              \ based on these logical qubits will be available in private preview\
              \ for Azure Quantum Elements in the coming months.\nLastly, we continue\
              \ to invest heavily in progressing beyond Level 2, scaling to the level\
              \ of quantum supercomputing. This is why we’ve been advocating for our\
              \ topological approach, the feasibility of which our[Azure Quantum team\
              \ has demonstrated]. At Level 3, we expect to be able to solve some\
              \ of our most challenging problems, particularly in fields like chemistry\
              \ and materials science, unlocking new applications that bring quantum\
              \ at scale together with the best of classical supercomputing and AI\
              \ —all connected in the Azure Quantum cloud.\nWe are excited to empower\
              \ the collective genius and make these breakthroughs accessible to our\
              \ customers. For more details on how we achieved today’s results, explore[our\

              April 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft [(MSFT.O), opens new tab] and Quantinuum\
              \ on Wednesday said they have achieved a key step in making quantum\
              \ computers a commercial reality by making them more reliable.\n\nThe\
              \ move is the latest in a race to perfect quantum computing in which\
              \ tech firms such as Microsoft, Alphabet's Google [(GOOGL.O), opens\
              \ new tab] and IBM [(IBM.N), opens new tab] are jostling with both rivals\
              \ and nation states to create machines that take advantage of quantum\
              \ mechanics to promise speeds far faster than conventional silicon-based\
              \ computers. Those quantum machines could make feasible scientific calculations\
              \ that would otherwise take millions of years with today's classical\
              \ computers.\n\nSign up [here.] \n\nBut the fundamental unit of quantum\
              \ computers - called a \"qubit\" - is fast but finicky, producing data\
              \ errors if the quantum computer is even slightly disturbed. To solve\
              \ that problem, quantum researchers often build more physical qubits\
              \ than needed and use error-correction techniques to yield a smaller\
              \ number of reliable and useful qubits.\n\nMicrosoft and Quantinuum\
              \ said they had made a breakthrough in that field. Microsoft applied\
              \ an error-correction algorithm that it wrote to Quantinuum's physical\
              \ qubits, yielding about four reliable qubits from 30 physical ones.\n\
              \nJason Zander, Microsoft's executive vice president for strategic missions\
              \ and technologies, said the company believes that is the best ratio\
              \ of reliable qubits from a quantum chip that has ever been shown.\n\
              \n\"We ran more than 14,000 individual experiments without a single\
              \ error. That's up to 800 times better than anything on record,\" Zander\
              \ told Reuters in an interview.\n\nMicrosoft said it plans to release\
              \ the technology to its cloud computing customers in the coming months.\n\
              \nQuantum researchers, both at Quantinuum and its rivals, often cite\
              \ a figure of about 100 reliable qubits as the number needed to beat\
              \ a conventional supercomputer. Neither Microsoft nor Quantinuum on\
              \ Wednesday would say how many more years they will need to use the\
              \ new technique to hit 100 reliable qubits.\n\nBut Ilyas Khan, the chief\
              \ product officer of Quantinuum, said, \"The current view is that we\
              \ have lopped at least two years off that, if not more.\"\n\nReporting\

              \ system with the unique architectural features and fidelity of Quantinuum’s[System\
              \ Model H2] quantum computer, our teams have demonstrated the most reliable\

              \ lower than the corresponding physical circuit error rates.\n![A graph\
              \ with blue text and blue squaresDescription automatically generated]\
              \ \nThis achievement is not just monumental for Quantinuum and Microsoft,\
              \ but it is a major advancement for the entire quantum ecosystem. It\
              \ is a crucial milestone on the path to building a hybrid supercomputing\
              \ system that can truly transform research and innovation across many\
              \ industries for decades to come. It also further bolsters H2’s title\
              \ as the highest performing quantum computer in the world.\n**Entering\
              \ a new era of quantum computing**\nHistorically, there have been widely\
              \ held assumptions about the physical qubits needed for large scale\
              \ fault-tolerant quantum computing and the timeline to quantum computers\
              \ delivering real-world value. It was previously thought that an achievement\
              \ like this one was still years away from realization –but together,\
              \ Quantinuum and Microsoft proved that fault-tolerant quantum computing\
              \ is in fact a reality.\nIn enabling today’s announcement, Quantinuum’s[System\
              \ Model H2] becomes the first quantum computer to advance to Microsoft’s*Level\
              \ 2 –Resilient*phase of quantum computing –an incredible milestone.\
              \ Until now, no other computer had been capable of producing reliable\
              \ logical qubits.\nUsing Microsoft’s qubit-virtualization system, our\
              \ teams used reliable logical qubits to perform 14,000 individual instances\
              \ of a quantum circuit with no errors, an overall result that is unprecedented.\
              \ Microsoft also demonstrated multiple rounds of active syndrome extraction\
              \ –an essential error correction capability for measuring and detecting\
              \ the occurrence of errors without destroying the quantum information\
              \ encoded in the logical qubit.\nAs we prepare to bring today’s logical\
              \ quantum computing breakthrough to commercial users, there is palpable\
              \ anticipation about what this new era means for our partners, customers,\
              \ and the global quantum computing ecosystem that has grown up around\
              \ our hardware, middleware, and software.\n##### **Collaborating to\
              \ reach a new era**\nTo understand this achievement, it is helpful to\
              \ shed some light on the joint work that went into it. Our breakthrough\
              \ would not have been possible without the close collaboration of the\
              \ two exceptional teams at Quantinuum and Microsoft over many years.\n\
              Building on a relationship that stretches back five years, we collaborated\
              \ with Microsoft Azure Quantum at a very deep level to best execute\
              \ their innovative qubit-virtualization system, including error diagnostics\
              \ and correction. The Microsoft team was able to optimize their error\
              \ correction innovation, reducing an original estimate of 300 required\
              \ physical qubits 10-fold, to create four logical qubits with only 30\
              \ physical qubits, bringing it into scope for the 32-qubit H2 quantum\
              \ computer.\nThis massive compression of the code and efficient virtualization\
              \ challenges a consensus view about the resources needed to do fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computing, where it has been routinely stated that a logical\
              \ qubit will require hundreds, even thousands of physical qubits. Through\
              \ our collaboration, Microsoft’s far more efficient encoding was made\
              \ possible by architectural features unique to the[System Model H2],\
              \ including our market-leading 99.8% two-qubit gate fidelity, 32 fully-connected\
              \ qubits, and compatibility with Quantum Intermediate Representation\
              \ (QIR).\nThanks to this powerful combination of collaboration, engineering\
              \ excellence, and resource efficiency, quantum computing has taken a\
              \ major step into a new era, introducing reliable logical qubits which\
              \ will soon be available to industrial and research users.\n##### **Understanding\
              \ today’s error correction breakthrough**\nIt is widely recognized that\
              \ for a quantum computer to be useful, it must be able to compute correctly\
              \ even when errors (or faults) occur –this is what scientists and engineers\
              \ describe as*fault-tolerance.*\nIn classical computing, fault-tolerance\
              \ is well-understood and we have come to take it for granted. We always\
              \ assume that our computers will be reliable and fault-free. Multiple\
              \ advances over the course of decades have led to this state of affairs,\
              \ including hardware that is incredibly robust and error rates that\
              \ are very low, and classical error correction schemes that are based\
              \ on the ability to copy information across multiple bits, to create\
              \ redundancy.\nGetting to the same point in quantum computing is more\
              \ challenging, although the solution to this problem has been known\
              \ for some time. Qubits are incredibly delicate since one must control\
              \ the precise quantum states of single atoms, which are prone to errors.\
              \ Additionally, we must abide by a fundamental law of quantum physics\
              \ known as the*no cloning theorem*, which says that you can’t just copy\
              \ qubits –meaning some of the techniques used in classical error correction\
              \ are unavailable in quantum machines.\nThe solution involves*entangling*groups\
              \ of physical qubits (thereby creating a*logical qubit*), storing the\
              \ relevant quantum information in the entangled state, and, via some\
              \ complex functions, performing computations*with error correction*.\
              \ This process is all done with the sole purpose of creating logical\
              \ qubit errors lower than the errors at the physical level.\nHowever,\
              \ implementing quantum error correction requires a significant number\
              \ of qubit operations. Unless the underlying physical fidelity is good\
              \ enough, implementing a quantum error correcting code will add more\
              \ noise to your circuit than it takes away. No matter how clever you\
              \ are in implementing a code, if your physical fidelity is poor, the\
              \ error correcting code will*only introduce more noise*. But, once your\
              \ physical fidelity is good enough (aka when the physical error rate\
              \ is “below threshold”), then you will see the error correcting code\
              \ start to actually help: producing logical errors below the physical\
              \ errors.\n![A close-up of a computer chipDescription automatically\

              \ the “racetrack” trap design*##### **Quantinuum’s fault-tolerance roadmap**\n\
              Today’s results are an exciting marker on the path to fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computing. The focus must and will now shift from quantum\
              \ computing companies simply stating the number of qubits they have\
              \ to explaining their connectivity, the underlying quality of the qubits\
              \ with reference to gate fidelities, and their approach to fault-tolerance.\n\
              Our H-Series hardware roadmap has not only focused on scaling qubits,\
              \ but also developing useable quantum computers that are part of a vertically\
              \ integrated stack. Our work across the full stack includes major advances\
              \ at every level, for instance just last month we proved that[our qubits\
              \ could scale] when we announced solutions to*the wiring problem*and*the\
              \ sorting problem*. By maintaining higher qubit counts and world class\
              \ fidelity, our customers and partners are able to advance further and\
              \ faster in fields such as material science, drug discovery, AI and\
              \ finance.\nIn 2025, we will introduce a new H-Series quantum computer,\
              \ Helios, that takes the very best the H-Series has to offer, improving\
              \ both physical qubit count*and*physical fidelity. This will take us\
              \ and our users below threshold for a wider set of error correcting\
              \ codes and make that device capable of supporting at least 10 highly\
              \ reliable logical qubits.\n**A path to real-world impact**\nAs we build\
              \ upon today’s milestone and lead the field on the path to fault-tolerance,\
              \ we are committed to continuing to make significant strides in the\
              \ research that enables the rapid advance of our technologies. We were\
              \ the[first to demonstrate] real-time quantum error correction (meaning\
              \ a fully-fault tolerant QEC protocol), a result that meant we were\
              \ the first to show:*repeated*real-time error correction, the ability\
              \ to perform quantum &quot;loops&quot; (repeat-until-success protocols),\
              \ and real-time decoding to determine the corrections during the computation.\
              \ We were the first to create non-Abelian topological quantum matter\
              \ and braid its anyons, leading to[topological qubits].\nThe native\
              \ flexibility of our QCCD architecture has allowed us to efficiently\
              \ investigate a large variety of fault-tolerant methods, and our best-in-class\
              \ fidelity means we expect to lead the way in achieving reduced error\
              \ rates with additional error correcting codes –and supporting our partners\
              \ to do the same. We are already working on making reliable quantum\
              \ computing a commercial reality so that our customers and partners\
              \ can unlock the enormous real-world economic value that is waiting\
              \ to be unleashed by the development of these systems.\nIn the short\
              \ term –with a hybrid supercomputer powered by a hundred reliable logical\
              \ qubits, we believe that organizations will be able to start to see\
              \ scientific advantages and will be able to accelerate valuable progress\
              \ toward some of the most important problems that mankind faces such\
              \ as modelling the materials used in batteries and hydrogen fuel cells\

              \ computing researcher had an army of students to help them write efficient\
              \ quantum algorithms? Large Language Models are starting to serve as\
              \ such a resource.***\nQuantinuum’s processors offer world-leading fidelity,\
              \ and recent experiments show that they have surpassed the limits of\
              \ classical simulation for certain computational tasks, such as simulating\
              \ materials. However, access to quantum processors is limited and can\
              \ be costly. It is therefore of paramount importance to optimise quantum\
              \ resources and write efficient quantum software. Designing efficient\
              \ algorithms is a challenging task, especially for quantum algorithms:\
              \ dealing with superpositions, entanglement, and interference can be\
              \ counterintuitive.\nTo this end, our joint team used[Hiverge’s] AI\
              \ platform for automated algorithm discovery, the Hive, to probe the\
              \ limits of what can be done in quantum chemistry. The Hive generates\
              \ optimised algorithms tailored to a given problem, expressed in a familiar\
              \ programming language, like Python. Thus, the Hive’s outputs allow\
              \ for increased interpretability, enabling domain experts to potentially\
              \ learn novel techniques from the AI-discovered solutions. Such AI-assisted\
              \ workflows lower the barrier of entry for non-domain experts, as an\
              \ initial sketch of an algorithmic idea suffices to achieve state-of-the-art\
              \ solutions.\nIn this initial proof-of-concept study, we demonstrate\
              \ the advantage of AI-driven algorithmic discovery of efficient quantum\
              \ heuristics in the context of quantum chemistry, in particular the*electronic\
              \ structure problem*. Our early explorations show that the Hive can\
              \ start from a naïve and simple problem statement and evolve a highly\
              \ optimised quantum algorithm that solves the problem, reaching chemical\
              \ precision for a collection of molecules. Our high-level workflow is\
              \ shown in*Figure 1.*Specifically, the quantum algorithm generated by\
              \ the Hive achieves a reduction in the quantum resources required by\
              \ orders of magnitude compared to current state-of-the-art quantum algorithms.\
              \ This promising result may enable the implementation of quantum algorithms\
              \ on near-term hardware that was previously thought impossible due to\
              \ current resource constraints.\n![] \n*Figure 1:****Workflow:****A\
              \ scientist prompts Hiverge&#x27;s platform, the Hive, with the molecule\
              \ of interest and a sketch of a quantum algorithm. The goal of the quantum\
              \ algorithm is to find the ground state energy of the molecule. The\
              \ Hive evolves the sketch into an efficient version that solves the\
              \ problem.*##### **The Electronic Structure Problem in Quantum Chemistry**\n\
              The electronic structure problem is central to quantum chemistry. The\
              \ goal is to prepare the ground state (the lowest energy state) of a\
              \ molecule and compute the corresponding energy of that state to chemical\
              \ precision or beyond. Classically, this is an exponentially hard problem.\
              \ In particular, classical treatments tend to fall short when there\
              \ are strong quantum effects in the molecule, and this is where quantum\
              \ computers may be advantageous.\nThe paradigm of variational quantum\
              \ algorithms is motivated by near-term quantum hardware. One starts\
              \ with a relatively easy-to-prepare initial state. Then, the main part\
              \ of the algorithm consists of a**sequence of parameterised operators**representing\
              \ chemically meaningful actions, such as manipulating electron occupations\
              \ in the molecular orbitals. These are implemented in terms of**parameterised\
              \ quantum gates**. Finally, the energy of the state is measured via\
              \ the molecule’s energy operator, the “Hamiltonian”, by executing the\
              \ circuit on a quantum computer and measuring all the qubits on which\
              \ the circuit is implemented. Taking many measurements, or “shots”,\
              \ the energy is estimated to the desired precision. The ground state\
              \ energy is found by iteratively optimising the parameters of the quantum\
              \ circuit until the energy converges to a minimum value. The general\
              \ form of such a variational quantum algorithm is illustrated in*Figure\
              \ 2*.\n![] \n*Figure 2: A****variational quantum algorithm****is defined\
              \ by a function select\\_next\\_operator that iteratively constructs\
              \ a parameterised quantum circuit as a sequence of operators [O1(θ1),O2(θ2),O3(θ3),\
              \ ...], and a function update\\_parameters that optimises its parameters;\
              \ these functions update the quantum circuit and refine it to its final\
              \ form that prepares the ground state. The Hive evolves sophisticated\
              \ versions of these functions starting from trivial versions, written\
              \ in a****familiar programming language****, producing a novel, efficient\
              \ variational quantum algorithm that solves the problem.*\nThe main\
              \ challenge in these frameworks is to design an appropriate quantum\
              \ circuit architecture, i.e. find an efficient sequence of operators,\
              \ and an efficient optimisation strategy for its parameters. It is important\
              \ to minimise the number of quantum operations in any given circuit,\
              \ as each operation is inherently noisy and the algorithm’s output degrades\
              \ exponentially. Another important quantum resource to be minimised\
              \ is the total number of circuits that need to be evaluated to compute\
              \ the energy values during the optimisation of the circuit parameters,\
              \ which is time-consuming.\nTo meet these challenges, we task the Hive\
              \ with designing a variational quantum algorithm to solve the ground\
              \ state problem, following the workflow shown in*Figure 1*. The Hive\
              \ is a distributed evolutionary process that evolves programs. It uses\
              \ Large Language Models to generate mutations in the form of edits to\
              \ an entire codebase. This genetic process selects the fittest programs\
              \ according to how well they solve a given problem. In our case, the\
              \ role of the quantum computer is to compute the fitness, i.e., the\
              \ ground state energy. Importantly, the Hive operates at the level of\
              \ a**programming language**; it readily imports and uses all known libraries\
              \ that a human researcher would use, including Quantinuum’s quantum\
              \ chemistry platform,[InQuanto]. In addition, the Hive can accept instructions\
              \ and requests in**natural language**, increasing its flexibility. For\
              \ example, we encouraged it to seek parameter optimisation strategies\
              \ that avoid estimating gradients, as this incurs significant overhead\
              \ in terms of circuit evaluations.  Intuitively, the interaction between\
              \ a human scientist and the Hive is analogous to a supervisor and a\
              \ group of eager and capable students: the supervisor provides guidance\
              \ at a high level, and the students collaborate and flesh out the general\
              \ idea to produce a working solution that the supervisor can then inspect.\n\
              We find that from an extremely basic starting point, consisting of a\
              \ skeleton for a variational quantum algorithm, the Hive can autonomously\
              \ assemble a bespoke variational quantum algorithm, which we call Hive-ADAPT.\
              \ Specifically, the Hive evolves heuristic functions that construct\
              \ a circuit as a sequence of quantum operators and optimise its parameters.\
              \ Remarkably, the Hive converged on a structure resembling the current\
              \ state-of-the-art, ADAPT-VQE. Crucially, however, Hive-ADAPT substantially\
              \ outperforms this baseline, delivering significant improvements in\
              \ chemical precision while reducing quantum resource requirements.\n\
              ![] \n*Figure 3: (Top): The measured ground state energy of the molecule\
              \ in Hartree (Ha) as a function of the bond length in Angstrom (Å),\
              \ i.e. the length of the O-H and Be-H bonds in H2O and BeH2, respectively.\
              \ Both ADAPT-VQE and Hive-ADAPT recover the energy curve. (Bottom):\
              \ The difference between the energy estimated by the quantum algorithms\
              \ and the reference value computed with the exact FCI method.****Hive-ADAPT\
              \ achieves chemical precision for more bond lengths****than ADAPT-VQE\
              \ (energy below dashed flat lines).****Hive-ADAPT****was evolved by\
              \ the Hive to solve a particular set of bond lengths (red circles),\
              \ and we observe that the same algorithm can also solve the problem\
              \ on other bond lengths (green circles), showing****generalisation****over\
              \ bond lengths.*\nA molecule’s ground state energy varies with the distances\
              \ between its atoms, called the “bond length”. For example, for the\
              \ molecule H2O, the bond length refers to the length of the O-H bond.\
              \ The Hive was tasked with developing an algorithm for a small set of\
              \ bond lengths and reaching chemical precision, defined as within 1.6e-3\
              \ Hartree (Ha) of the ground state energy computed with the exact Full\
              \ Configuration Interaction (FCI) algorithm. As we show in*Figure 3*,\
              \ remarkably, Hive-ADAPT achieves chemical precision for more bond lengths\
              \ than ADAPT-VQE. Furthermore, Hive-ADAPT also reaches chemical precision\
              \ for other “unseen” bond lengths, showcasing the**generalisation**ability\
              \ of the evolved quantum algorithm. Our results were obtained from classical\
              \ simulations of the quantum algorithms, where we used NVIDIA CUDA-Q\
              \ to leverage the parallelism enabled by GPUs. Further, relative to\
              \ ADAPT-VQE, Hive-ADAPT exhibits one to two orders of magnitude reduction\
              \ in quantum resources, such as the number of circuit evaluations and\
              \ the number of operators used to construct circuits, which is crucial\
              \ for practical implementations on actual near-term processors.\nFor\
              \ molecules such as BeH2 at large Be-H bond lengths, a complex initial\
              \ state is required for the algorithm to be able to reach the ground\
              \ state using the available operators. Even in these cases, by leveraging\
              \ an efficient state preparation scheme implemented in[InQuanto], the\
              \ Hive evolved a dedicated strategy for the preparation of such a complex\
              \ initial state, given a set of basic operators to achieve the desired\
              \ chemical precision.\nTo validate Hive-ADAPT under realistic conditions,\
              \ we employed Quantinuum’s H2 Emulator, which provides a faithful classical\
              \ simulator of the H2 quantum computer, characterised by a 1.05e-3 two-qubit\
              \ gate error rate. Leveraging the Hive&#x27;s inherent flexibility,\
              \ we adapted the optimisation strategy to explicitly penalise the number\
              \ of two-qubit gates—the dominant noise source on near-term hardware—by\
              \ redefining the fitness function. This constraint guided the Hive to\
              \ discover a noise-aware algorithm capable of constructing hardware-efficient\
              \ circuits. We subsequently executed the specific circuit generated\
              \ by this algorithm for the LiH molecule at a bond length of 1.5 Åwith\
              \ the Partition Measurement Symmetry Verification (PMSV) error mitigation\
              \ procedure. The resulting energy of -7.8767 ±0.0031 Ha, obtained using\
              \ 10,000 shots per circuit with a discard rate below 10% in the PMSV\
              \ error mitigation procedure, is close to the target FCI energy of -7.8824\
              \ Ha and demonstrates the Hive&#x27;s ability to successfully tailor\
              \ algorithms that balance theoretical accuracy with the rigorous constraints\
              \ of hardware noise and approach chemical precision as much as possible\
              \ with current quantum technology.\nFor illustration purposes, we show\
              \ an example of an elaborate code snippet evolved by the Hive starting\
              \ from a trivial version:\nQuantinuum’s in-house quantum chemistry expert,\
              \ Dr. David Zsolt Manrique, commented,\n> “I found it amazing that the\
              \ Hive converged to a domain-expert level idea. By inspecting the code,\
              \ we see it has identified the well-known perturbative method, ‘MP2’,\
              \ as a useful guide; not only for setting the initial circuit parameters,\
              \ but also for ordering excitations efficiently. Further, it systematically\
              \ and laboriously fine-tuned those MP2-inspired heuristics over many\
              \ iterations in a way that would be difficult for a human expert to\
              \ do by hand. It demonstrated an impressive combination of domain expertise\
              \ and automated machinery that would be useful in exploring novel quantum\
              \ chemistry methods.”\n##### **Looking to the Future**\nIn this initial\
              \ proof-of-concept collaborative study between Quantinuum and Hiverge,\
              \ we demonstrate that AI-driven algorithm discovery can generate efficient\
              \ quantum heuristics. Specifically, we found a great reduction in quantum\
              \ resources, which is impactful for quantum algorithmic primitives that\
              \ are frequently reused. Importantly, this approach is highly flexible;\
              \ it can accommodate the optimisation of any desired quantum resource,\
              \ from circuit evaluations to the number of operations in a given circuit.\
              \ This work opens a path toward fully automated pipelines capable of\
              \ developing problem-specific quantum algorithms optimised for NISQ\
              \ as well as future hardware.\nAn important question for further investigation\
              \ regards transferability and generalisation of a discovered quantum\
              \ solution to other molecules, going beyond the generalisation over\
              \ bond lengths of the same molecule that we have already observed. Evidently,\
              \ this approach can be applied to improving any other near-term quantum\
              \ algorithm for a range of applications from optimisation to quantum\
              \ simulation.\nWe have already[demonstrated an error-corrected implementation\
              \ of quantum phase estimation on quantum hardware], and an AI-driven\
              \ approach promises further hardware-tailored improvements and optimal\
              \ use of quantum resources. Beyond NISQ, we envision that AI-assisted\
              \ algorithm discovery will be a fruitful endeavour in the fault-tolerant\
              \ regime, as well, where high-level quantum algorithmic primitives (quantum\
              \ fourier transform, amplitude amplification, quantum signal processing,\
              \ etc.) are to be combined optimally to achieve computational advantage\
              \ for certain problems.\nNotably, we’ve entered an era where quantum\
              \ algorithms can be written in high-level programming languages, like\
              \ Quantinuum’s[Guppy], and approaches that integrate Large Language\
              \ Models directly benefit. Automated algorithm discovery is promising\
              \ for improving routines relevant to the full quantum stack, for example,\
              \ in low-level quantum control or in quantum error correction.\ntechnical\n\

              |\ntechnical\nNovember 13, 2025\nFrom Memory to Logic\n*By Dr. Noah\
              \ Berthusen*\nThe earliest works on quantum error correction showed\
              \ that by combining many noisy physical qubits into a complex entangled\
              \ state called a &quot;logical qubit,&quot; this state could survive\
              \ for arbitrarily long times. QEC researchers devote much effort to\
              \ hunt for codes that function well as &quot;quantum memories,&quot;\
              \ as they are called. Many promising code families have been found,\
              \ but this is only half of the story.\nBeing able to keep a qubit around\
              \ for a long time is one thing, but to realize the theoretical advantages\
              \ of quantum computing we need to run quantum circuits. And to make\
              \ sure noise doesn&#x27;t ruin our computation, these circuits need\
              \ to be run on the logical qubits of our code. This is often much more\
              \ challenging than performing gates on the physical qubits of our device,\
              \ as these &quot;logical gates&quot; often require many physical operations\
              \ in their implementation. What&#x27;s more, it often is not immediately\
              \ obvious which logical gates a code has, and so converting a physical\
              \ circuit into a logical circuit can be rather difficult.\nSome codes,\
              \ like the famous[surface code], are good quantum memories and also\
              \ have easy logical gates. The drawback is that the ratio of physical\
              \ qubits to logical qubits (the &quot;encoding rate&quot;) is low, and\
              \ so many physical qubits are required to implement large logical algorithms.\
              \ High-rate codes that are good quantum memories have also been found,\
              \ but computing on them is much more difficult. The holy grail of QEC,\
              \ so to speak, would be a high-rate code that is a good quantum memory\
              \ and also has easy logical gates. Here, we make progress on that front\
              \ by developing a new code with those properties.\n##### **Building\
              \ on prior error correcting codes**\nA recent work from Quantinuum QEC\
              \ researchers introduced[genon codes]. The underlying construction method\
              \ for these codes, called the &quot;&quot;symplectic double cover,&quot;&quot;\
              \ also provided a way to obtain logical gates that are well suited for\
              \ Quantinuum&#x27;&#x27;s QCCD architecture. Namely, these &quot;&quot;SWAP-transversal&quot;&quot;\
              \ gates are performed by applying single qubit operations and relabeling\
              \ the physical qubits of the device. Thanks to the all-to-all connectivity\
              \ facilitated through qubit movement on the QCCD architecture, this\
              \ relabeling can be done in software essentially for free. Combined\
              \ with extremely high fidelity (\\~1.2 x10-5) single-qubit operations,\
              \ the resulting logical gates are similarly high fidelity.\nGiven the\
              \ promise of these codes, we take them a step further in our[new paper].\
              \ We combine the symplectic double codes with the [[4,2,2]] Iceberg\
              \ code using a procedure called &quot;code concatenation&quot;. A concatenated\
              \ code is a bit like nesting dolls, with an outer code containing codes\
              \ within it---with these too potentially containing codes. More technically,\
              \ in a concatenated code the logical qubits of one code act as the physical\
              \ qubits of another code.\nThe new codes, which we call &quot;concatenated\
              \ symplectic double codes&quot;, were designed in such a way that they\
              \ have many of these easily-implementable SWAP-transversal gates. Central\
              \ to its construction, we show how the concatenation method allows us\
              \ to &quot;upgrade&quot; logical gates in terms of their ease of implementation;\
              \ this procedure may provide insights for constructing other codes with\
              \ convenient logical gates. Notably, the SWAP-transversal gate set on\
              \ this code is so powerful that only two additional operations (logical\
              \ T and S) are necessary for universal computation. Furthermore, these\
              \ codes have many logical qubits, and we also present numerical evidence\
              \ to suggest that they are good quantum memories.\nConcatenated symplectic\
              \ double codes have one of the easiest logical computation schemes,\
              \ and we didn’t have to sacrifice rate to achieve it. Looking forward\
              \ in our roadmap, we are targeting hundreds of logical qubits at \\\
              ~ 1x 10-8logical error rate by 2029. These codes put us in a prime position\
              \ to leverage the best characteristics of our hardware and create a\
              \ device that can achieve real commercial advantage.\ntechnical\nAll\n\

          answer: 'Quantum supremacy — also called quantum advantage — is the point
            at which a programmable quantum computer can carry out a well‑defined
            computational task that no classical computer can solve in a realistic
            amount of time.  In other words, it is the first experimental demonstration
            that a quantum device outperforms the best conventional supercomputers
            on a specific problem ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy)).  The
            concept was introduced by physicist John Preskill in 2012 to mark a clear,
            near‑term milestone on the road to full‑scale quantum computing ([quantamagazine.org](https://www.quantamagazine.org/john-preskill-explains-quantum-supremacy-20191002)).


            Achieving supremacy does not require a universal, error‑corrected machine;
            it only needs a task that is easy to verify yet intractable for classical
            algorithms.  The most widely cited example came in 2019 when Google’s
            53‑qubit Sycamore processor sampled the output of a random quantum circuit
            in about 200 seconds—a calculation that would take the world’s fastest
            supercomputer thousands of years, thereby crossing the supremacy threshold ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1666-5)).  Similar
            claims have followed from companies such as D‑Wave, Quantinuum and Xanadu,
            each using different hardware platforms (superconducting, trapped‑ion
            or photonic) to demonstrate tasks beyond classical reach ([cacm.acm.org](https://cacm.acm.org/news/how-far-away-is-quantum-supremacy)).


            The milestone matters because it validates that quantum hardware can exploit
            genuine quantum‑mechanical effects—superposition, entanglement and interference—to
            solve problems faster than any known classical method.  While the specific
            tasks used for supremacy (e.g., random‑circuit sampling) are not yet useful
            for practical applications, the achievement signals that the field is
            moving toward quantum computers capable of tackling real‑world challenges
            such as chemistry simulation, optimization and cryptanalysis ([livescience.com](https://www.livescience.com/technology/computing/what-is-quantum-supremacy)).'
