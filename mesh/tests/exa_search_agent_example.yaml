              [Back] \n![Latest Developments in Quantum Computing - 2026 Edition]\
              \ \nQuantum computing has once been a niche topic of research, but now\
              \ it is rapidly moving towards finding a firm spot in commercial applications.\
              \ Factors like advancement in hardware and components, AI-powered software\
              \ applications, a mature business ecosystem, and an increase in enterprise\
              \ investment in innovative solutions like quantum computing have set\
              \ a strong foundation for quantum wave in the coming years. In 2026,\
              \ we can expect quantum to move from&ldquo;potential technology&rdquo;\
              \ to&ldquo;practical products&rdquo;. Quantum computing has come a long\
              \ way, and recent developments look quite transformative. Let&#39;s\
              \ delve deeper and understand the emerging trends and the state of**[quantum\
              \ computing in the near future] **, and what global organizations should\
              \ be watching.\n**Hardware and System Maturity**\n**Technology leaders\
              \ in industry**acknowledge that quantum computing is moving from demonstration\
              \ to deployment rapidly. The&ldquo;noisy intermediate-scale quantum&rdquo;\
              \ (NISQ) era is evolving quite rapidly into an era where correction,\
              \ stability, and larger-scale architectures are priorities.\nAs per\
              \ McKinsey and Company&rsquo;s Quantum Technology Monitor 2025, the\
              \ industry is moving towards improving coherence, connectivity, and\
              \ overall system reliability rather than simply adding qubits.\n**Specific\
              \ developments in this sector include:**\n* Increasing efforts are made\
              \ in grouping and controlling physical qubits to minimize errors and\
              \ create more stable computation\n* Focus on a more holistic system\
              \ where hardware manufacturers is working closely with software teams,\
              \ algorithm developers, and ecosystem partners to work on full-stack\
              \ solutions rather than isolated quantum chips\n* Diverse qubit modalities\
              \ and quantum hardware platforms\nIn essence, quantum hardware is getting\
              \ more advanced. Though we are still far from developing a fully fault-free\
              \ machine, we have advanced to a great extent in making building blocks\
              \ robust and future-ready.\n**Market Momentum and Ecosystem Growth**\n\
              Tech giants are pushing hard to make**quantum computing**a feasible\
              \ commercial product/service, and it is not limited to just academic\
              \ curiosity. Several consultancy reports clear this notion.\nAccording\
              \ to McKinsey, the three-pillar quantum ecosystem (quantum computing-\
              \ quantum communication- quantum sensing) could generate nearly tens\
              \ of billions of dollars of revenue by the mid-2030s. Another report\
              \ by Bain &amp; Company highlighted that quantum computing is moving\
              \ from&ldquo;theoretical to inevitable&rdquo; and predicts a lot of\
              \ value in the future.\nAlso, investment activity is increasing for\
              \ quantum computing at an unprecedented rate. As per Quantum Insider,\
              \ there are numerous small/huge funding rounds and multi-year contracts\
              \ that clearly show**quantum computing**is moving from experimentation\
              \ to early commercialization.\nFrom startups to technology giants to\
              \ governments, investment in quantum ecosystems is growing, and this\
              \ is a positive sign.\n**Emerging Trends and Strategic Use-Cases**\n\
              * **Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS) and Democratization**\nInstead of each\
              \ organization building its own dedicated quantum hardware, they can\
              \ leverage cloud-based quantum services and hybrid development models.\
              \ It will help organizations to experiment with and adopt quantum tools\
              \ without investing much.\n* **Hybrid Classical-Quantum Architectures**\n\
              **Technology leaders in industry**should also keep in mind that quantum\
              \ computers are not a replacement for traditional computing. Bain predicts\
              \ the future computer environment will be more like a&ldquo;mosaic&rdquo;\
              \ of CPUs/GPUs powered by quantum accelerators designed for specific\
              \ problem types.\n* **Error Correction, Logical Qubits, and Fault Tolerance**\n\
              The focus is on moving towards a fault-free machine from NISQ. So, skilled\
              \ professionals, including**[data scientists, AI scientists] **, and\
              \ engineers, are working towards building logical qubits and improving\
              \ gate fidelity as well as extending coherence times and improving how\
              \ they control qubits.\n* **Quantum Computing and Cybersecurity**\n\
              The introduction of**quantum computing in the near future**presents\
              \ a dual opportunity in the field of cybersecurity, and its implications\
              \ can already be felt. Quantum computers can make many of the existing\
              \ cryptographic systems vulnerable. Therefore, organizations are rushing\
              \ towards post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum-secure communications.\n\
              * **Focus on Industry Applications**\nWe might also see industry-specific\
              \ quantum computing and not only broad-purpose machines. The early real-world\
              \ value will likely come from specific industries such as simulating\
              \ molecules, discovering materials, optimizing logistics and supply\
              \ chains, real-time financial modeling, etc. According to McKinsey,\
              \ chemicals, life science, finance, and mobility sectors have the highest\
              \ potential for**quantum computing**.\n* **Hardware Modality Diversity**\n\
              There are multiple developments in quantum hardware. From superconducting\
              \ to trapped ion and photonic qubits to hybrid systems, the field of\
              \ quantum computing is witnessing real hardware advancements. On top\
              \ of that, we can also see regional innovation hubs across the globe\
              \ making every effort to leverage existing hardware to develop and power\
              \ quantum computing.\n**Challenges and Realistic Timeframes**\nThough\
              \ we are advancing faster towards quantum computing,**technology leaders\
              \ in the industry**have to effectively address a few challenges for\
              \ more accurate results. Here are a few things to consider:\n* Despite\
              \ rapid advancements, we are still quite far from achieving fault-free\
              \ and general-purpose quantum computers. Bain notes we are yet to achieve\
              \ several key breakthroughs like hardware scale, algorithm maturity,\
              \ ROI evidence, etc.\n* It is difficult to achieve practical return\
              \ on investment as it requires quantum to perform at par with classical\
              \ computers continuously.\n* Key challenges like data loading, designing\
              \ algorithms, and integration in a hybrid environment are still bottlenecks\
              \ to real-world use cases. Quantum systems work in an entirely different\
              \ manner than classical ones; therefore, organizations have to employ\
              \ new disciplines\n* Most importantly, lack of skilled workforce, underdeveloped\
              \ infrastructure, and limitations in the supply chain of exotic materials,\
              \ cryogenics, and quantum fabrication are the real problems. This prevents\
              \ full-scale deployment of**quantum computing**to the production environment\
              \ from the lab.\nConsidering these points, several**[technology leaders\
              \ in the industry] **feel that domain-specific and high-value quantum\
              \ use-cases might emerge in the coming few years, but the broader enterprise\
              \ will still take at least a decade of time for full-scale adoption.\n\
              **Strategic Takeaways for Organizations**\nNow, the important thing\
              \ &ndash; what is it for enterprises today, and what do they need to\
              \ do?\nGiven the rapid development, organizations across the globe should\
              \ employ these strategic actions:\n* **Start evaluating your quantum\
              \ readiness**\nAccess your existing technology infrastructure, common\
              \ business problems, and evaluate if quantum computing can help you\
              \ solve the problems identified\n* **Invest in skills**\nIt can be a\
              \ great strategic step to develop quantum literacy within your organization.\
              \ Also, consider partnering with quantum service providers and software\
              \ vendors that might give you an early advantage\n* **Consider a hybrid\
              \ strategy**\nAdopting only quantum systems will not only be expensive\
              \ but also inefficient. So, adopt a hybrid approach, i.e., using**[quantum\
              \ computing] **alongside classical computers.\n* **Prepare for cybersecurity\
              \ challenges**\nQuantum computing can be a game-changer in the field\
              \ of cybersecurity. Cybercriminals are already harvesting data to decrypt\
              \ it later. So, start preparing now and prepare for post-quantum cryptography\n\
              * **Pilot use-cases**\nStart with smaller and result-oriented projects\
              \ where quantum systems can truly deliver value. Consider projects where\
              \ classical computers struggle, like large combinatorial optimization\
              \ or complex molecular simulation.\n**Quantum Computing Is All Theory-\
              \ Not Any More!**\nThe rapid technological advancement has transformed\
              \ quantum from theoretical to commercial. Several factors, including\
              \ advanced hardware, increased interest and investment, and innovations,\
              \ are fueling the development and adoption of quantum computing. But\
              \ remember, the technology has not yet developed, and we are still far\
              \ from achieving foundational breakthroughs. However, for business and\
              \ technology leaders worldwide, the goal should be clear &ndash; to\
              \ build future-ready skills, work on pilot projects, and design a hybrid\
              \ infrastructure. Those who start embracing quantum computing from now\
              \ on will definitely be far ahead of their competition and gain a competitive\
              \ advantage.\n## Most Popular\n* [Why Are Edge AI and Tiny ML Critical\

              \ The year isn&#039;t over yet, but we&#039;ve already seen record-breaking\
              \ quantum computers, skyrocketing levels of investment, and demonstrations\
              \ of real-world benefits.\n![Preparing your organisation for the quantum\
              \ threat] \nCredit: Shutterstock\nIn all the hype about AI it can be\
              \ easy to forget that we&rsquo;re witnessing another revolution in computing:\
              \ the beginning of the quantum era.\nQuantum computers are expected\
              \ to tackle problems completely out of reach of today&rsquo;s machines,\
              \ bringing about new developments in chemistry, biology and physics.\
              \ They&rsquo;ll also be able to tackle problems of interest to the average\
              \ enterprise, such as logistics, AI and encryption, proponents say.\n\
              At the beginning of this year, however, it all seemed far away.\n&ldquo;AI\
              \ is dominating the attention economy,&rdquo; says James Sanders, semiconductor\
              \ industry analyst at TechInsights. &ldquo;The incrementalism of quantum\
              \ computing is difficult to translate to public interest, against the\
              \ backdrop of AI.&rdquo;\nIn fact, in January, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\
              \ said that[quantum computing is still 15 to 30 years from being truly\
              \ useful].\nThe industry spent the year trying to prove him wrong. Here\
              \ are 10 areas in which we&rsquo;ve seen significant breakthroughs and\
              \ milestones in quantum computing.\n## 1. World&rsquo;s most powerful\
              \ computer enables quantum AI\nOn November 5, Quantinuum[announced the\
              \ commercial launch] of its new Helios quantum computer, claiming to\
              \ be the most accurate commercial system available today. &ldquo;You\
              \ would need to harvest every star in the universe to power a classical\
              \ machine that could do the same calculations we did with Helios,&rdquo;\
              \ said[Anthony Ransford], Helios lead architect, in a statement.\nAccording\
              \ to the company, it&rsquo;s the most accurate computer to date, can\
              \ be programmed just like a classical computer, and uses industry tools\
              \ like[Nvidia&rsquo;s CUDA-Q]. In addition, early testers such as SoftBank\
              \ and JPMorgan Chase have already conducted &ldquo;commercially relevant\
              \ research,&rdquo; the company said. Other early testers include Amgen,\
              \ which is exploring hybrid quantum-machine learning for biologics,\
              \ and BMW, which is doing research on fuel cells.\n&ldquo;For the first\
              \ time enterprises can access a highly accurate, general-purpose quantum\
              \ computer to drive real world impact,&rdquo; said Rajeeb Hazra, Quantinuum\
              \ president and CEO, in the announcement.\nQuantinuum also partnered\
              \ with Nvidia to accelerate the combination of quantum computing and\
              \ generative AI via NVQLink.\nIn a sign of how seriously the industry\
              \ is taking the company, Fidelity just joined Quantinuum&rsquo;s[latest\
              \ funding round], bringing the total to $800 million raised, for a valuation\
              \ of $10 billion.\n![Quantinuum Helios quantum computer] \nThe Helios\
              \ quantum computing platform is available to customers through Quantinuum&rsquo;s\
              \ cloud service and on-premises offering.\nQuantinuum\n## 2. Record\
              \ levels of investment\nQuantinuum isn&rsquo;t the only company to rake\
              \ in money this year. In September, photonic qubits company PsiQuantum\
              \ became the world&rsquo;s most funded quantum startup,[raising $1 billion\
              \ in funding] to build a commercially useful quantum computer. That\
              \ brought its valuation to $7 billion, which was a lot at the time.\n\
              According to[research from SpinQ], quantum computing companies raised\
              \ $3.77 billion in equity funding during the first nine months of 2025\
              \ &mdash; nearly triple the $1.3 billion raised in all of 2024.\nThere\
              \ are also publicly-traded quantum computing firms, chief among them\
              \ being Rigetti, IonQ, Quantum Computing and D-Wave, and their stock\
              \ prices have been on a wild ride lately.[According to Motley Fool],\
              \ share prices have gone up by more than 3,000% over the past year.\n\
              &ldquo;Such significant financings reflect investor confidence in near-term\
              \ commercialization milestones,&rdquo; says[Yuval Boger], chief commercial\
              \ officer at QuEra Computing. &ldquo;And they prompt vendors, customers\
              \ and funding agencies to treat quantum technologies as entering a deployment\
              \ phase rather than purely an R&amp;D play.&rdquo;\nIn fact, national\
              \ governments invested $10 billion by April of this year, up from $1.8\
              \ billion in all of 2024, according to SpinQ.\nMost recently, on November\
              \ 6, DARPA announced the next stage of its Quantum Benchmarking Initiative,[selecting\
              \ 11 quantum computing firms] for up to $15 million each in funding\
              \ to help get us to utility-scale computing by 2033.\n## 3. Commercial\
              \ applications\nLike Quantinuum&rsquo;s testers, a number of companies\
              \ have said they&rsquo;re finding commercial value in quantum computing.\n\
              In September, HSBC announced that they were able to use IBM&rsquo;s\
              \ Heron quantum computer to[improve their bond trading predictions by\
              \ 34%] compared to classical computing alone. While this is the only\
              \ public announcement, so far, of using quantum computing for trading,\
              \ it doesn&rsquo;t mean that other financial firms aren&rsquo;t already\
              \ doing it without publicity.\n![HSBC uses IBM Heron quantum computer\
              \ ] \nHSBC is using IBM&rsquo;s Heron quantum computer to improve their\
              \ bond trading predictions by 34% compared to classical computing.\n\
              HSBC\nIn March, engineering company Ansys used IonQ&rsquo;s quantum\
              \ computer to[speed up its analysis of fluid interactions in medical\
              \ devices] by 12% compared to classical computing alone.\nAlso in March,\
              \ Ford Otosan announced that they used[D-Wave&rsquo;s quantum annealing\
              \ technology] to reduce scheduling times from 30 minutes to less than\
              \ five. And this wasn&rsquo;t just a test. This is deployed in production.\n\
              D-Wave&rsquo;s quantum computer is not a general-purpose quantum machine\
              \ like those made by other quantum computing companies but is more akin\
              \ to an analogue computer. But it is particularly good at solving optimization\
              \ problems such as those that come up in logistics and supply chain\
              \ management.\nIn July, D-Wave sponsored a survey,[conducted by Wakefield\
              \ Research], of 400 business leaders working in optimization. According\
              \ to the survey, 81% of leaders said that they&rsquo;ve reached the\
              \ limit of what they can do with classical computers, and 53% are already\
              \ planning to build quantum computing into their workflows. Twenty-two\
              \ percent said that they already see quantum making a &ldquo;huge impact&rdquo;\
              \ for the early adopters, and another 50% expect it to be disruptive\
              \ for the industry. Of those who haven&rsquo;t yet implemented quantum\
              \ optimization, 31% expect to roll it out within the next two years.\n\
              Another emerging use case for quantum computing is the combination of\
              \ quantum and AI. In a May survey of 500 global business leaders by\
              \ SAS,[60% said they are actively investing in], or exploring opportunities,\
              \ in quantum AI.\nAnd, according to a[report by Bain], quantum computing\
              \ could unlock up to $250 billion of market value for the pharmaceutical,\
              \ finance, logistics, and materials science industries &mdash; though\
              \ the total market for quantum computing is less than $1 billion today.\n\
              ## 4. Quantum error correction reaches practical milestones\nAll of\
              \ the above announcements were made possible by[dramatic improvement\
              \ in error correction].\nThe problem is that qubits are very sensitive.\
              \ Vibrations, temperature changes, really anything can cause them to\
              \ generate errors. To address the problem, quantum computing companies\
              \ added extra qubits as backups. But as the quantum computers got bigger,\
              \ the error rates would go up even faster, meaning that it was impossible\
              \ to catch up.\nIn the last couple of years, researchers started to\
              \ find ways around this problem, both in making the individual qubits\
              \ less prone to errors, and by improving the error-correction mechanisms.\
              \ This year, the error-correction announcements became a tsunami of\
              \ progress.\nCompanies announcing error-correction developments this\
              \ year include QuEra, with its &ldquo;[magic states] &rdquo; announcement,\
              \ as well as[Alice &amp; Bob],[Microsoft],[Google],[IBM],[Quantinuum],[IonQ],[Nord\
              \ Quantique],[Infleqtion], and[Rigetti], among others.\n&ldquo;I think\
              \ we&rsquo;re very comfortably in the era of escape velocity,&rdquo;\
              \ says[Fred Chong], ACM Fellow and a professor at University of Chicago.\
              \ &ldquo;The quantum devices are fairly good, and error correction codes\
              \ have gotten better.&rdquo; Chong is also the chief scientist for quantum\
              \ software at Infleqtion and an advisory board member for Quantum Circuits.\n\
              This means that building a big, useful, quantum computer is no longer\
              \ a physics problem but an engineering problem, he says. And since engineering\
              \ progresses more reliably than basic science, quantum companies are\
              \ no longer waiting for science breakthroughs that may or may not happen.\n\
              IBM released its[updated quantum roadmap] in June, laying out its plans\
              \ for a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer by 2029. IonQ also\
              \ released its[accelerated roadmap] in June, with 1,600 logical qubits\
              \ in 2028, 8,000 in 2029, and 80,000 in 2030.\n## 5. More firms join\
              \ the &lsquo;quantum advantage&rsquo; club\nQuantum computing is still\
              \ in its infancy, so when one of these tiny new quantum computers outperforms\
              \ a giant classical supercomputer, it&rsquo;s big news. This year, several\
              \ companies joined the quantum advantage club &mdash; or claimed that\
              \ they had.\nIn March, D-Wave announced that they&rsquo;d achieved the\
              \ world&rsquo;s &ldquo;first and only demonstration of quantum computational\
              \ supremacy on a useful, real-world problem.&rdquo; The company claimed\
              \ that[its annealing quantum computer outperformed one of the world&rsquo;s\
              \ most powerful classic supercomputers] in solving a magnetic materials\
              \ simulation problem.\nIn China, scientists at the University of Science\
              \ and Technology of China[reported in August] that their Jiuzhang 4.0\
              \ photonic quantum computer achieved quantum advantage &mdash; but for\
              \ a very narrow, limited-use Gaussian boson sampling task. Still, the\
              \ supercomputer El Capitan would have taken longer than the age of the\
              \ universe to carry out the same task, the researchers said &mdash;\
              \ specifically a million trillion trillion trillion years.\nIn October,\
              \ IonQ said it had already[achieved quantum advantage in drug discovery\
              \ and engineering applications] and, in a separate announcement, said\
              \ that it had[surpassed classical methods in chemistry simulations].\n\
              Also in October, Google announced that they were able to[run a verifiable\
              \ test] where their quantum computer was 13,000 times faster than the\
              \ world&rsquo;s fastest classical supercomputer. Google said that this\
              \ was the first time in history that this happened. Specifically, that\
              \ this was the first time such a test was run with a verifiable algorithm,\
              \ one that anyone could go out and test for themselves.\nThe thing is,\
              \ it&rsquo;s hard to compare apples to apples here, because every company\
              \ uses the benchmark that makes its own computers look best.\n&ldquo;Everybody\
              \ solves the problem with some combination of hardware and software\
              \ tricks,&rdquo; says[Sridhar Tayur], professor at Carnegie Mellon University&rsquo;s\
              \ Tepper School of Business. &ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t there be a set of\
              \ benchmarks, where you write down exactly what you did, what classical\
              \ computer did you use, how much time was spent on classical, and how\
              \ much time was spent on quantum? That would be nice &mdash; but that\
              \ has been missing. There has been no verification and no comparison.&rdquo;\n\
              However, IBM has[released a set of industry benchmarks] this year, he\
              \ adds.\nIn July, IBM researchers also[released a paper] explaining\
              \ why it is so difficult to accurately evaluate quantum advantage claims.\
              \ According to IBM, real quantum advantage requires industry consensus\
              \ &mdash; but that this will be achieved sometime before the end of\
              \ 2026. The researchers also added that IBM itself has already surpassed\
              \ classical computers in some respects.\n&ldquo;We have arrived already\
              \ at a place where quantum computing is a useful scientific tool capable\
              \ of performing computations that even the best exact classical algorithms\
              \ can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; the researchers wrote. &ldquo;We and our partners\
              \ are already conducting a range of experiments on quantum computers\
              \ that are competitive with the leading classical approximation methods.&rdquo;\n\
              For example, in June, IBM partnered with RIKEN to use the IBM Quantum\
              \ Heron processor alongside the[Fugaku supercomputer] to simulate molecules\
              \ at a level beyond the ability of classical computers alone, and at\
              \ &ldquo;utility scale,&rdquo; IBM said.\n## 6. New hardware breakthroughs\
              \ in size and qubit types\nMany companies announced hardware breakthroughs\
              \ this year, including[Microsoft&rsquo;s new Majorana 1 chip] and[Amazon&rsquo;s\
              \ new Ocelot chip]. (Google announced their new Willow chip in December\
              \ of last year.)\nBut the biggest announcement, in terms of the number\
              \ of qubits involved, has to be[Caltech&rsquo;s record-breaking 6,100-qubit\
              \ array].\nIn a September announcement, Caltech researchers said that\
              \ they split a laser beam into 12,000 parts in order to trap 6,100 cesium\
              \ atoms. These qubits stayed in superposition for 13 seconds, ten times\
              \ longer than previous arrays, and were even able to move the atoms\
              \ round. Being able to move qubits opens the door to more efficient\
              \ error correction and is a key benefit of this neutral atom approach\
              \ to quantum computers.\n![Caltech 6100 qubit array] \nCaltech physicists\
              \ create 6,100-qubit array. Kon H. Leung is seen working on the apparatus\
              \ used to trap 6,100 atoms.\nCaltech/Gyohei Nomura\n## 7. Quantum-classical\
              \ hybrids become all the rage\nIBM wasn&rsquo;t the only company combining\
              \ quantum computers with classical ones for extra oomph.\nNvidia has\
              \ leaned into this heavily. At the end of October, the company[announced\
              \ an open system architecture] for coupling its GPUs with quantum processors\
              \ to build quantum supercomputers. The new platform, called NVQLink,\
              \ is also integrated with Nvidia&rsquo;s CUDA-Q quantum software platform.\n\
              Partners include many of the top firms in the quantum computing industry,\
              \ including Alice &amp; Bob, Anyon Computing, Atom Computing, Diraq,\
              \ Infleqtion, IonQ, IQM Quantum Computers, ORCA Computing, Oxford Quantum\
              \ Circuits, Pasqal, Quandela, Quantinuum, Quantum Circuits Inc., Quantum\
              \ Machines, Quantum Motion, QuEra, Rigetti, SEEQC and Silicon Quantum\
              \ Computing &mdash; as well as quantum control system builders including\
              \ Keysight Technologies, Quantum Machines, Qblox, QubiC and Zurich Instruments.\n\
              &ldquo;If you think of the science and chemistry problems people anticipate\
              \ solving with quantum computers, the way we solve them today is with\
              \ high performance computing,&rdquo; says[Scott Buchholz], government\
              \ and public services CTO and quantum computing lead at Deloitte. &ldquo;So\
              \ having them talk to each other, and having each one focus on the things\
              \ it&rsquo;s strongest on, is actually a good idea.&rdquo;\n## 8. Qubit\
              \ types proliferate\nIf anyone was hoping that 2025 would help us see\
              \ which approach to quantum computing was going to be the winner, they\
              \ would be disappointed.\nWhile superconducting circuits &mdash; the\
              \ computers that look like giant chandeliers &mdash; were still big,\
              \ there was a lot of progress on other approaches.\nDARPA&rsquo;s list\
              \ of Quantum Benchmarking Initiative companies has two companies with\
              \ neutral atom qubits (Atom Computing and Quera), four companies with\
              \ silicon spin qubits (Diraq, Photonic, Quantum Motion, and Silicon\
              \ Quantum Computing), two companies with superconducting qubits (IBM\
              \ and Nord Quantique), two companies with trapped ion qubits (IonQ and\
              \ Quantinuum), and one company with photonic qubits (Xanadu).\nPsiQuantum\
              \ unveiled its photonic quantum processor in February. And we even saw\
              \ brand new types of qubits, such as Microsoft&rsquo;s new Majorana\
              \ 1 chip, which uses the topological qubit approach.\nAmazon&rsquo;s\
              \ Ocelot chip uses a unique hybrid approach, combining cat qubits with\
              \ transmon qubits. And[Quantum Circuits also follows a new approach].\
              \ It&rsquo;s a superconducting circuit qubit, but with a &ldquo;dual\
              \ rail&rdquo; control mechanism.\n&ldquo;With the dual-rail approach\
              \ we&rsquo;ve built a computer that&rsquo;s very reliable,&rdquo; says[Andrei\
              \ Petrenko], Quantum Circuits&rsquo; head of product. &ldquo;It combines\
              \ the reliability benchmarks of trapped ions and neutral atoms with\
              \ the speed of the superconducting platform.&rdquo; The dual-rail is\
              \ like a check-engine light, he adds. &ldquo;No other quantum computer\
              \ tells you in real time if it encounters an error, but ours does.&rdquo;\n\
              In October, Quantum Circuits announced a[partnership with Nvidia] and\
              \ support for CUDA-Q, and, in February, a[proof-of-concept project]\
              \ related to drug discovery.\n## 9. Post-quantum cryptography becomes\
              \ enterprise priority\nIn May, Google researchers combined advances\
              \ in error correction and quantum operations with more efficient algorithms\
              \ to make breaking RSA encryption[20 times easier]. That means enterprises\
              \ may have less time than they planned to[move to the new quantum-safe\
              \ encryption algorithms].\n&ldquo;Our post-quantum cryptography team\
              \ is ringing the fire bell,&rdquo; says[Isabella Bello Martinez], senior\
              \ quantum technologist at Booz Allen Hamilton.\nWith the industry advancing\
              \ to fault-tolerant computers faster than expected, the deadline is\
              \ approaching quickly. &ldquo;That is a cause for concern for organizations\
              \ who have not yet thought about post-quantum cryptography,&rdquo; she\
              \ says. &ldquo;Or they think that someone else will take care of it,\
              \ that Microsoft will take care of it &mdash; you have to think about\
              \ how everything you use works together.&rdquo;\nAnd it&rsquo;s more\
              \ than just the fact that adversaries will be able to use quantum computers\
              \ to decrypt today&rsquo;s standard encryption someday. They can also\
              \ vacuum up encrypted data now and save it to decrypt later.\nFortunately,\
              \ we do now have five[NIST-certified post-quantum algorithms].\n## 10.\
              \ Nobel Prize in Physics for superconducting quantum circuits\nFinally,\
              \ to cap off a groundbreaking year for quantum computing, three scientists[received\
              \ the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics] for their work on superconducting\
              \ quantum circuits. The work itself was done in the 1980s and showed\
              \ that quantum effects can show up even in large-scale things &mdash;\
              \ a super-cold superconducting circuit can effectively act as it was\
              \ a single quantum object, as if it was a single atom or subatomic particle.\n\
              The fact that they got the award this year shows how important this\
              \ work has become to today&rsquo;s quantum computers and sensors. According\
              \ to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which awards the prizes,\
              \ these awards are given for &ldquo;achievements that have conferred\
              \ the greatest benefit to humankind.&rdquo;\nSuperconducting circuits\
              \ are the foundational technology for many of today&rsquo;s most advanced\
              \ quantum computers, including those built by Google and IBM, says University\
              \ of Chicago&rsquo;s Chong, as well as quantum sensors. &ldquo;And they&rsquo;re\
              \ relatively large, much larger than an atom,&rdquo; he adds. &ldquo;Larger\
              \ than you would expect to see quantum effects. This macroscale is what\
              \ this Nobel Prize is recognizing.&rdquo;\nWho would have expected 2025\
              \ to turn out to be as big for quantum as it was? Well, the United Nations,\
              \ for one. In mid-2024, the United Nations declared 2025 to be the[International\
              \ Year of Quantum Science and Technology].\nAnd so far, it is.\n[High-Performance\

              # 2025 year in review: Quantum computing development accelerates\n[![]]\
              \ By[Larry Dignan] \nQuantum computing hogged the headlines in 2025\
              \ and it was ok to say it was the year of quantum--or maybe qubits--after\
              \ just a few months. The quantum computing developments were flying,\
              \ but it's worth noting that we're years away from big commercial adoption.\n\
              Nevertheless, CxOs need to get ready. After all, the boardroom is getting\
              \ tired of AI. The AI trade lost steam. Boardrooms are going to start\
              \ asking about your quantum computing plans in 3, 2, 1.\nWhy was 2025\
              \ the year of quantum? For starters, there was a new development almost\
              \ weekly. Pure play quantum stocks were hot. Hyperscale cloud players\
              \ were deadly serious about quantum, with AWS, Microsoft Azure and Google\
              \ Cloud all running credible efforts. Quantinuum threaded the needle\
              \ between AI and quantum computing. IBM scaled aggressively. And real\
              \ use cases emerged as companies like IonQ cited projects with DARPA,\
              \ AstraZeneca, and others.\nHere's what's happened in 2025.\n**January**\n\
              * Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang[said quantum computing is 15- to 30-years\
              \ away from being really useful]. Those comments landed at CES 2025\
              \ and came up because quantum computing stocks had a torrid run at the\
              \ end of 2024 as[quantum became more practical],[focused on hybrid HPC\
              \ architectures] and Google Cloud touted a new quantum chip called Willow.\n\
              * Quantum vendors[have tried to prove Huang wrong] since he made those\
              \ comments.[Days after Huang’s comments the pure plays such as IonQ\
              \ and D-Wave all cited commercial projects].\n* Microsoft[launched its\
              \ Quantum Ready Initiative], which helps enterprises sort out use cases\
              \ for quantum computing and get ready to deploy.\n* IonQ, University\
              \ of Maryland and State of Maryland[announced a $1 billion investment\
              \ to create the \"Capital of Quantum.\"] Under the initiative, IonQ\
              \ will be an anchor partner as it continues to pursue federal government\
              \ contracts. IonQ at the University of Maryland's Discovery District,\
              \ which is near Washington, DC and Annapolis, MD.\n* D-Wave[said it\
              \ will expand distribution of its quantum computing offerings via a\
              \ partnership with Carahsoft], which is a premier distributor of IT\
              \ to the government. Under the deal, Carahsoft will aggregate D-Wave's\
              \ offerings as a reseller. The partnership will give D-Wave throughput\
              \ under Carahsoft's contract vehicles.\n**February**\n* Quantinuum[launched\
              \ its Generative Quantum AI framework] that aims to combine AI, quantum\
              \ computing and supercomputers to address problems classical computing\
              \ can't solve.\n* [Microsoft launched Majorana 1, a quantum computing\
              \ chip with a Topological Core architecture]. Topological quantum computing\
              \ uses a concept similar to semiconductors using \"anyons,\" which can\
              \ arrange qubits into patterns. A topological superconductor is a material\
              \ that can create a new state of matter. It's harnessed to create a\
              \ more stable qubit that can be digitally controlled.\n* [IonQ is doubling\
              \ down on quantum networking with an acquisition], diversifying globally\
              \ and has a new CEO along with fourth quarter results and plans to raise\
              \ more capital.[The purchase of ID Quantique] gives IonQ more quantum\
              \ networking patents and diversifies the company's global footprint\
              \ with expansion in South Korea.[In November, IonQ bought Quibitekk].\
              \ IonQ named Niccolo de Masi CEO, with Peter Chapman becoming Executive\
              \ Chair. Chapman will focus on strategy and enterprise adoption.\n*\
              \ [Amazon Web Services launched Ocelot], a first-generation quantum\
              \ computing chip that was developed with the California Institute of\
              \ Technology.\n* And for good measure, Constellation Research updated\
              \ its quantum computing shortlists.[Constellation ShortList™ Quantum\
              \ Computing Platforms] |[Quantum Computing Software Platforms] |[Quantum\
              \ Full Stack Players] \n* **March**\n* D-Wave said its quantum computer\
              \ outperformed a classical supercomputer[in solving magnetic materials\
              \ simulation problems]. The company also reported its fourth quarter\
              \ results. D-Wave[followed up with a quantum blockchain architecture].\n\
              * Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang at Nvidia GTC 2025 hosted[the company’s first\
              \ quantum day]. A panel that featured most of the quantum computing\
              \ CEOs amounted to a mea culpa tour following Huang’s comments in January.\n\
              * Quantinuum quantum computers[have created true verifiable randomness]\
              \ in a project that could be valuable to cybersecurity.[In a paper in\
              \ Nature], Quantinuum along with JPMorganChase, Oak Ridge National Laboratory,\
              \ Argonne National Laboratory and the University of Texas[have generated\
              \ true randomness] critical to cryptography and cybersecurity. Quantinuum\
              \ said the latest advance was built on research from Shih-Han Hung and\
              \ Scott Aaronson of the University of Texas at Austin.\n* IonQ and Ansys\
              \ said they also outperformed classical computing[when designing medical\
              \ devices]. IonQ also expanded its quantum networking portfolio and[raised\
              \ more than $372 million via an equity offering].\n* Classiq said it\
              \ worked with Sumitomo Corp. and Mizuho-DL Financial Technology to successfully\
              \ compress quantum circuits in[implementing quantum algorithms for Monte\
              \ Carlo simulations].\n* Rigetti Computing and Quanta Computer said\
              \ they will spend a combined $500 million to accelerate development\
              \ and commercialization of superconducting quantum computing. The company\
              \ also reported[fourth quarter revenue] of $2.27 million and 2024 revenue\
              \ of $10.79 million. The net loss for 2024 was $200.99 million.\n**April**\n\
              * IBM said it will spend $30 billion in R&amp;D in the US as part of\
              \ a broader $150 billion spend. That R&amp;D in part will be devoted\
              \ to quantum computing. IBM CEO Arvind Krishna said on the company’s\
              \ first quarter earnings call: \"In Quantum, we are proud to partner\
              \ with the Basque Government to deploy Europe's first IBM Quantum System\
              \ 2 in Spain, a milestone in global Quantum leadership.\" IBM also[published\
              \ a paper on how quantum addresses problems in combinatorial optimization].\n\
              * IonQ moved to expand its reach. It established a quantum computing\
              \ and networking hub in Chattanooga, Tennessee in a $22 million deal.\
              \ The company also outlined an agreement with Toyota Tsusho and AIST\
              \ to expand quantum computer reach in Japan. IonQ also signed a memorandum\
              \ of understanding with Intellian to extend into South Korea. IonQ also\
              \ said its Forte Enterprise system is available through Amazon Braket.\n\
              * D-Wave and Davidson Technologies, a defense technology company, assembled\
              \ D-Wave's Advantage2 annealing quantum system at Davidson's Huntsville,\
              \ Alabama headquarters.\n* Classiq, a quantum software development company,\
              \ and Wolfram Research joined CERN’s Open Quantum Institute (OQI). The\
              \ two companies will target quantum-based technologies to optimize electrical\
              \ networks.\n* Researchers at Tokyo University of Science, Japan[unveiled\
              \ DSAPS], a chip system that overcomes capacity and precision limits\
              \ with dual scalable annealing processors.\n* U.S. Defense Advanced\
              \ Research Projects Agency’s (DARPA)[Quantum Benchmarking Initiative\
              \ (QBI)] selected host of companies to evaluate a variety of technologies\
              \ for creating quantum bits. The companies include: Alice &amp; Bob,\
              \ Atlantic Quantum, Atom Computing, Diraq, Hewlett Packard Enterprise,\
              \ IBM, IonQ, Nord Quantique, Oxford Ionics, Photonic Inc., Quantinuum,\
              \ Quantum Motion, QuEra Computing, Rigetti Computing, Silicon Quantum\
              \ Computing Pty. Ltd. and Xanadu.\n**May**\n* IonQ went shopping again\
              \ with the acquisitions of Lightsynq Technologies, a startup focused\
              \ on photonic interconnects and quantum memory, and Capella Space, which\
              \ specializes in quantum space networks. See:[IonQ’s plan: Quantum networks\
              \ extending into space] \n* [IBM launched a Flex Plan] for access to\
              \ its quantum computing hardware in a move that aims to expand access\
              \ for organizations, enterprises and researchers who want access without\
              \ monthly limits. The IBM Quantum Flex Plan provides access on day one\
              \ with an entry point of $30,000+ to gain access to Big Blue's entire\
              \ fleet of quantum systems. Flex plan users will also get the advanced\
              \ software features, support and early access to new releases.\n* Classiq,\
              \ a quantum computing software company,[said it raised $110 million\
              \ in Series C funding]. The company is looking to build the software\
              \ stack for quantum computing.[The funding], led by Entrée Capital and\
              \ a bevy of other investors, will be used to build Classiq's go-to-market,\
              \ customer success and R&amp;D teams globally.\n* D-Wave Quantum said[its\
              \ Advantage2 annealing quantum computer is now commercially available]\
              \ and is likely to contribute to revenue growth. Advantage2[is available]\
              \ via D-Wave's Leap quantum cloud service as well as on-premises deployments.\
              \ Dr. Alan Baratz, CEO of D-Wave, said the system is a milestone in\
              \ the company's development and able to \"solve hard problems outside\
              \ the reach of one of the world’s largest exascale GPU-based classical\
              \ supercomputers.\"\n* [Cisco is entering the quantum computing networking\
              \ ring] with a lab and prototype processor. The move is notable since\
              \ Cisco is a networking giant in the enterprise. In addition, quantum\
              \ networking has been seen as a key piece of infrastructure.\n**June**\n\
              * [IonQ said it will acquire UK's Oxford Ionics in a deal valued at\
              \ $1.075 billion] in mostly stock and $10 million in cash. The deal\
              \ is designed to accelerate IonQ's quantum computing roadmap and establish\
              \ a global hub for research and development.\n* Quantum Computing Inc.\
              \ raised $200 million with an At-the-Market equity offering.\n* IBM\
              \ and Riken, a national research laboratory in Japan, unveiled the first\
              \ IBM Quantum System Two ever to be deployed outside of US. The quantum\
              \ computer will be co-located with Riken's supercomputer Fugaku.\n*\
              \ Rigetti completed a $350 million At-the-Market equity offering.\n\
              * [IBM updated its quantum computing] roadmap heading into IBM Quantum\
              \ Starling, a large-scale fault-tolerant quantum system in 2029. Big\
              \ Blue said IBM Quantum Starling will be delivered by 2029 and installed\
              \ at the IBM Quantum Data Center in Poughkeepsie, New York. That system\
              \ is expected to perform 20,000 times ore operations than today's quantum\
              \ computers.\n**July**\n* D-Wave[raised $400 million] with an At-the-Market\
              \ equity offering. The move left D-Wave with about $815 million in cash.\
              \ D-Wave also outlined a strategic development effort to advance cryogenic\
              \ packaging.\n**August**\n* D-Wave released a[collection of developer\
              \ tools] for quantum AI and machine learning.\n* Rigetti Computing said\
              \ its 36-qubit[multi-chip quantum computer is generally available] and\
              \ outlined a plan to build a 100-qubit system with 99.5% fidelity by\
              \ the end of 2025, but quantum advantage is likely 4 years away. Second\
              \ quarter results fell short of estimates.\n* IonQ,[which has been on\
              \ an acquisition spree], reported[second quarter results] with a net\
              \ loss of $177.5 million on revenue of $20.7 million. IonQ had $1.6\
              \ billion of pro forma cash and equivalents as of July 9. IonQ also\
              \ filled out its leadership team with David Chung as VP, Corporate Development;\
              \ Shad Reed as VP, Engineering Public Sector; Petrina Zaraszczak as\

              * Rigetti said it landed two orders for quantum computing systems for\
              \ $5.7 million. Rigetti also announced a $5.8 million AFRL contract\
              \ with QphoX.\n* Quantum Computing closed a private placement of common\
              \ stock to raise $500 million.\n* IonQ announced purchase of Vector\
              \ Atomic, completed the Oxford Ionics acquisition and inked a US Department\
              \ of Energy memorandum of understanding to deploy quantum technology\
              \ in space.\n* IonQ launched a federal unit to focus on US government\
              \ use cases. The company also named Inder M. Singh as Chief Financial\
              \ Officer and Chief Operating Officer.\n* SPACs are back as Horizon\
              \ Quantum said it would go public via a merger with dMY Squared Technology\
              \ Group.\n**October**\n* Quantum computing companies, often with minimal\
              \ or no revenue, raise funds at a brisk pace to fortify balance sheets.\
              \ Raise money when you don't need to is a good motto for CFOs to have. Even\
              \ after a recent pullback Rigetti shares are up 200% on the year and\
              \ IonQ is up 50%. D-Wave is up 356%.\n* Swiss Quantum Technology inked\
              \ a €10 million to deploy D-Wave's Advantage2 system.\n* The Basque\
              \ Government and IBM launched Europe's first IBM Quantum System Two\
              \ in Donostia-San Sebastián.\n* IonQ priced a $2 billion equity offering\
              \ to fortify its balance sheet following a run-up. IonQ also completed\
              \ its acquisition of Vector Atomic.\n* Arqit Quantum said its second\
              \ quarter revenue wil be $460,000 to $470,000 with fiscal 2025 revenue\
              \ of $525,000 to $535,000. The company had $36.9 million in cash.\n\
              * Quantum Computing announced a private placement of common stock to\
              \ raise $750 million.\n* [Google said its Willow quantum computing chip\

              \ photonics business for $110 million.\n* D-Wave launched a US government\
              \ unit.\n**What now?**\nOne thing worth noting here is that 2025 became the\
              \ year of quantum readiness and development rather than deployment.\
              \ That said, CxOs need to start thinking about quantum. Constellation\
              \ Research analyst Holger Mueller broke down how you should be thinking\
              \ about the year of quantum.\n* If you need to protect IP against state\
              \ actors, you should deploy quantum key encryption today.\n* If you\
              \ have smaller planning and simulation issues in your business, get\
              \ your pilot going.\n* If you are on process manufacturing, chemical,\
              \ pharma etc. - you must have quantum pilots. You likely have them on\
              \ annealing and laser gate already but need to keep an eye on all super\
              \ conducting players.\n* Everybody else can sit back and get the popcorn,\
              \ but keep an eye on medium-scale planning and simulation use cases.\
              \ All enterprises have those. On the tech side, watch stabilization,\
              \ componentization and then scale loop. IBM is the most advanced and\
              \ learn from their process.\n[**] [**] [**] [**] [**] \n#### Business\

              \ of Breakthrough Milestones and Commercial Transition\n2025.10.31·BlogQuantum\
              \ Industry Trends 2025\nThe quantum computing industry has reached an\
              \ inflection point in 2025, transitioning from theoretical promise to\
              \ tangible commercial reality. What was once confined to research laboratories\
              \ and expert discussions has evolved into a sector attracting billions\
              \ in investment, government support, and corporate partnerships. This\
              \ transformation reflects fundamental breakthroughs in hardware, software,\
              \ error correction, and most importantly, the emergence of practical\
              \ applications that demonstrate real-world quantum advantage.\n## Market\
              \ Expansion and Investment Momentum\nThe financial landscape for quantum\
              \ computing in 2025 reflects unprecedented investor confidence. The\
              \ global quantum computing market reached USD 1.8 billion to USD 3.5\
              \ billion in 2025, with projections indicating growth to USD 5.3 billion\
              \ by 2029 at a compound annual growth rate of 32.7 percent. More aggressive\
              \ forecasts suggest the market could reach USD 20.2 billion by 2030,\
              \ representing a 41.8 percent CAGR, positioning quantum computing as\
              \ one of the fastest-growing technology sectors of the decade.\nVenture\
              \ capital funding has surged dramatically, with over USD 2 billion invested\
              \ in quantum startups during 2024, representing a 50 percent increase\
              \ from 2023. The first three quarters of 2025 alone witnessed USD 1.25\
              \ billion in quantum computing investments, more than doubling previous\
              \ year figures. Major institutional players have signaled their commitment\
              \ to the sector: JPMorgan Chase announced a USD 10 billion investment\
              \ initiative specifically naming quantum computing as a strategic technology,\
              \ while governments worldwide have invested USD 3.1 billion in 2024,\
              \ primarily linked to national security and competitiveness objectives.\n\
              ## Hardware Breakthroughs: The Error Correction Revolution\nPerhaps\
              \ the most significant development in 2025 has been the dramatic progress\
              \ in quantum error correction, addressing what many considered the fundamental\
              \ barrier to practical quantum computing. Google's Willow quantum chip,\
              \ featuring 105 superconducting qubits, achieved a critical milestone\
              \ by demonstrating exponential error reduction as qubit counts increased—a\
              \ phenomenon known as going \"below threshold.\" The Willow chip completed\
              \ a benchmark calculation in approximately five minutes that would require\
              \ a classical supercomputer 10^25 years to perform, providing strong\
              \ evidence that large, error-corrected quantum computers can be constructed\
              \ in the future.\nIBM unveiled its fault-tolerant roadmap, centered\
              \ on the Quantum Starling system targeted for 2029, which will feature\
              \ 200 logical qubits capable of executing 100 million error-corrected\
              \ operations. The company plans to extend operations to 1,000 logical\
              \ qubits by the early 2030s and quantum-centric supercomputers with\
              \ 100,000 qubits by 2033, utilizing quantum low-density parity-check\
              \ codes that reduce overhead by approximately 90 percent.\nMicrosoft\
              \ introduced Majorana 1, a topological qubit architecture built on novel\
              \ superconducting materials designed to achieve inherent stability requiring\
              \ less error correction overhead. The company's novel four-dimensional\
              \ geometric codes require very few physical qubits per logical qubit\
              \ and exhibit a 1,000-fold reduction in error rates. In collaboration\
              \ with Atom Computing, Microsoft demonstrated 28 logical qubits encoded\
              \ onto 112 atoms and successfully created and entangled 24 logical qubits,\
              \ representing the highest number of entangled logical qubits on record.\n\
              Recent breakthroughs have pushed error rates to record lows of 0.000015%\
              \ per operation, and researchers at QuEra published algorithmic fault\
              \ tolerance techniques that reduce quantum error correction overhead\
              \ by up to 100 times, moving timelines for practical quantum computing\
              \ substantially forward. NIST research through the SQMS Nanofabrication\
              \ Taskforce achieved coherence times of up to 0.6 milliseconds for the\
              \ best-performing qubits, a significant advancement for superconducting\
              \ quantum technology.\n## The Path to Quantum Advantage and Practical\
              \ Applications\nIn March 2025, IonQ and Ansys achieved a significant\
              \ milestone by running a medical device simulation on IonQ's 36-qubit\
              \ computer that outperformed classical high-performance computing by\
              \ 12 percent—one of the first documented cases of quantum computing\
              \ delivering practical advantage over classical methods in a real-world\
              \ application. Google announced the Quantum Echoes algorithm breakthrough,\
              \ demonstrating the first-ever verifiable quantum advantage running\
              \ the out-of-order time correlator algorithm, which runs 13,000 times\
              \ faster on Willow than on classical supercomputers. The company also\
              \ demonstrated molecular geometry calculations using nuclear magnetic\
              \ resonance, creating a \"molecular ruler\" that measures longer distances\
              \ than traditional methods.\nResearch institutions have identified convergence\
              \ points where quantum computing could address significant scientific\
              \ workloads. A National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center\
              \ study found that quantum resource requirements have declined sharply\
              \ while industry roadmaps project hardware capabilities rising steeply.\
              \ The analysis suggests that quantum systems could address Department\
              \ of Energy scientific workloads—including materials science, quantum\
              \ chemistry, and high-energy physics—within five to ten years. Materials\
              \ science problems involving strongly interacting electrons and lattice\
              \ models appear closest to achieving quantum advantage, while quantum\
              \ chemistry problems have seen algorithm requirements drop fastest as\
              \ encoding techniques have improved.\n## Industry Adoption and Quantum-as-a-Service\
              \ Evolution\nThe commercialization of quantum computing has accelerated\
              \ through Quantum-as-a-Service (QaaS) platforms offered by IBM, Microsoft,\
              \ and emerging providers including SpinQ, democratizing access to quantum\
              \ computing and reducing barriers to entry for organizations exploring\
              \ quantum applications. These cloud-based models enable broader experimentation\
              \ and accelerate commercial adoption across industries, allowing companies\
              \ to conduct pilot projects without massive capital investments in quantum\
              \ hardware infrastructure.\nMajor corporations continue expanding their\
              \ quantum initiatives. In April 2025, Fujitsu and RIKEN announced a\
              \ 256-qubit superconducting quantum computer—four times larger than\
              \ their 2023 system—with plans for a 1,000-qubit machine by 2026. IBM's\
              \ roadmap calls for the Kookaburra processor in 2025 with 1,386 qubits\
              \ in a multi-chip configuration featuring quantum communication links\
              \ to connect three chips into a 4,158-qubit system. Atom Computing's\
              \ neutral atom platform has attracted attention from DARPA, with the\
              \ company demonstrating utility-scale quantum operations and planning\
              \ to scale systems substantially by 2026.\nQuantum computing partnerships\
              \ are reshaping the ecosystem. Strategic alliances between hardware\
              \ developers, cloud providers, and industry-specific application companies\
              \ have created integrated platforms combining quantum processors with\
              \ classical co-processing units. These hybrid quantum-classical architectures\
              \ represent the realistic path to near-term practical quantum systems,\
              \ addressing the limitations of pure quantum approaches while leveraging\
              \ quantum capabilities for specific problem classes where they excel.\n\
              ## The Emerging Quantum Software and Algorithm Landscape\nAlgorithmic\
              \ development has become increasingly sophisticated in 2025. Beyond\
              \ the well-established Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum\
              \ Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), new algorithms are being\
              \ developed specifically for finance, logistics, chemistry, and materials\
              \ science applications. AI-driven quantum algorithm discovery is accelerating\
              \ development timelines, while quantum machine learning transitions\
              \ from theoretical interest to practical implementation, particularly\
              \ in applications where traditional AI struggles with data complexity\
              \ or scarcity.\nResearch from quantum companies and academic institutions\
              \ demonstrates that co-design—where hardware and software are developed\
              \ collaboratively with specific applications in mind—has become a cornerstone\
              \ of quantum innovation. This approach integrates end-user needs early\
              \ in the design process, yielding optimized quantum systems that extract\
              \ maximum utility from current hardware limitations. Initiatives by\
              \ QuEra and other companies focused on developing error-corrected algorithms\
              \ underscore the importance of aligning technology with practical applications.\n\
              ## Quantum Applications Across Industries\nPharmaceutical research represents\
              \ one of the most advanced application domains. Google's collaboration\
              \ with Boehringer Ingelheim demonstrated quantum simulation of Cytochrome\
              \ P450, a key human enzyme involved in drug metabolism, with greater\
              \ efficiency and precision than traditional methods. These advances\
              \ could significantly accelerate drug development timelines and improve\
              \ predictions of drug interactions and treatment efficacy.\nFinancial\
              \ services has emerged as an early adopter sector. JPMorgan Chase partnered\
              \ with IBM to explore quantum algorithms for option pricing and risk\
              \ analysis, with early studies indicating quantum models could outperform\
              \ classical Monte Carlo simulations in both speed and scalability. The\
              \ financial industry is anticipated to become one of the earliest beneficiaries\
              \ of commercially useful quantum computing, with technologies expected\
              \ to become available within the next few years.\nSupply chain optimization,\
              \ battery development, materials science, cryptography, and artificial\
              \ intelligence represent additional high-priority application areas\
              \ where quantum computing demonstrates significant potential impact.\
              \ University of Michigan scientists used quantum simulation to solve\
              \ a 40-year puzzle about quasicrystals, proving that exotic materials\
              \ are fundamentally stable through atomic structure simulation with\
              \ quantum algorithms.\n## Post-Quantum Cryptography: A National Security\
              \ Priority\nThe emergence of practical quantum computing has elevated\
              \ cybersecurity to a critical priority. NIST finalized its principal\
              \ set of encryption algorithms designed to withstand quantum computer\
              \ attacks in August 2024, releasing three new post-quantum cryptography\
              \ standards containing computer code, implementation instructions, and\
              \ intended uses. The standards—ML-KEM (based on lattice cryptography),\
              \ ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA—are ready for immediate implementation.\nThe White\
              \ House has initiated quantum policy acceleration, preparing executive\
              \ actions focused on federal adoption of quantum technology and post-quantum\
              \ cryptography migration. These directives aim to set federal agency\
              \ timelines for transitioning to post-quantum cryptographic standards\
              \ ahead of fault-tolerant quantum computer development. Industry experts\
              \ estimate that transitioning government and enterprise networks to\
              \ post-quantum cryptography could require a decade or more due to the\
              \ complexity of legacy infrastructure, making policy acceleration timely\
              \ and strategically necessary.\n## The Quantum Workforce Crisis and\
              \ Educational Mobilization\nDespite unprecedented investment and breakthroughs,\
              \ the quantum industry faces a significant talent shortage. Only one\
              \ qualified candidate exists for every three specialized quantum positions\
              \ globally, and U.S. quantum-related job postings have tripled from\
              \ 2011 to mid-2024. The McKinsey &amp; Company research estimates that\
              \ over 250,000 new quantum professionals will be needed globally by\
              \ 2030, creating an immediate and growing demand for skilled quantum\
              \ workforce members.\nIn response, 2025 has witnessed significant educational\
              \ mobilization. The United Nations designated 2025 as the International\
              \ Year of Quantum Science and Technology, celebrating 100 years since\
              \ the initial development of quantum mechanics. This recognition has\
              \ catalyzed educational and training initiatives worldwide. Universities\
              \ are expanding quantum curricula from research-focused doctoral programs\
              \ to undergraduate and certificate-level offerings. MIT, for example,\
              \ expanded its quantum education cohort from a dozen students in its\
              \ inaugural year to 65 students, with the institution now offering executive\
              \ education programs accessible online globally.\nSpinQ Technology has\
              \ positioned itself at the forefront of quantum education through its\
              \ dual-track approach combining educational nuclear magnetic resonance\
              \ systems with industrial-grade superconducting quantum computers. The\
              \ company's training ecosystem addresses workforce development challenges\
              \ through hands-on hardware access, authentic quantum experiences, and\
              \ expert-led instruction, recognizing that practical quantum computing\
              \ expertise requires interaction with real quantum systems, not merely\
              \ simulations.\nCloud-based quantum computing platforms have democratized\
              \ quantum education access, enabling learners worldwide to develop quantum\
              \ skills without expensive on-site infrastructure or geographical constraints.\
              \ These platforms provide remote access to quantum processors, simulators,\
              \ and development tools, fundamentally transforming how students and\
              \ professionals engage with quantum technology.\n## Strategic Government\
              \ Initiatives and International Competition\nGovernment support for\
              \ quantum technologies has reached unprecedented levels across multiple\
              \ nations. The U.S. National Quantum Initiative has invested USD 2.5\
              \ billion in programs between 2019 and 2024, establishing Quantum Leap\
              \ Challenge Institutes and the National Quantum Virtual Laboratory as\
              \ national resources for quantum research and development. The U.S.\
              \ Chips and Science Act included provisions for evaluating quantum workforce\
              \ needs and initiatives.\nInternational competition in quantum computing\
              \ has intensified. China's national venture fund has committed RMB 1\
              \ trillion (approximately USD 140 billion) for quantum technology development,\
              \ while Europe advances through the Quantum Flagship Program coordinating\
              \ research across member states. Countries including Canada, Australia,\
              \ South Korea, and Japan have announced ambitious quantum initiatives\
              \ emphasizing workforce expansion, technology development, and international\
              \ collaboration.\nDARPA has initiated the Underexplored Systems for\
              \ Utility Scale Quantum Computing (US2QC) program, investigating whether\
              \ any quantum computing approach can achieve utility-scale operation\
              \ where computational value exceeds cost by 2033. This initiative provides\
              \ structured government support for diverse quantum architectures including\
              \ topological qubits, photonic qubits, and neutral atom systems.\n##\
              \ Quantum Stock Market Performance and IPO Activity\nThe equity markets\
              \ have responded enthusiastically to quantum computing developments.\
              \ Pure-play quantum companies have delivered extraordinary returns,\
              \ with D-Wave Quantum (NYSE: QBTS) surging over 3,700 percent in the\
              \ trailing year, IonQ (NYSE: IONQ) experiencing a 700 percent surge\
              \ with analyst projections of USD 44.80 average stock price, and Rigetti\
              \ Computing (NASDAQ: RGTI) reaching all-time highs with 5,700 percent\
              \ gains over the last 12 months.\nSeveral high-profile quantum companies\
              \ are pursuing public offerings to fund expansion. Infleqtion, a neutral-atom\
              \ quantum specialist, will merge with Churchill Capital Corp X in a\
              \ SPAC transaction valuing the firm at USD 1.8 billion and raising USD\
              \ 540 million, with trading expected to commence by late 2025 or early\
              \ 2026. PsiQuantum, with over USD 1.3 billion in funding and focused\
              \ on photonic quantum computers, is anticipated to pursue a 2026 public\
              \ offering. SpinQ Technology, leveraging its dual-track quantum education\
              \ and industrial systems platform, is preparing for a Hong Kong or Shenzhen\
              \ Stock Exchange listing within 12-18 months.\n## Key Technology Trends\
              \ Shaping the Industry\nSix major trends dominate the 2025 quantum computing\
              \ landscape: increased experimentation with logical qubits as error\
              \ correction matures; development of specialized hardware and software\
              \ for specific problem classes rather than universal quantum computing\
              \ approaches; increased networking of noisy intermediate-scale quantum\
              \ devices together; additional layers of software abstraction facilitating\
              \ easier quantum programming; expanded workforce development tools and\
              \ training programs; and continuous improvement in physical qubit performance\
              \ through novel materials and fabrication techniques.\nCo-design methodologies\
              \ have become increasingly prevalent, with hardware and software teams\
              \ collaborating from project conception to optimize systems for specific\
              \ applications. This approach acknowledges that current quantum computers\
              \ cannot solve a wide range of problems and emphasizes extracting maximum\
              \ utility from limited resources through tight hardware-software integration.\n\
              The convergence of quantum computing with artificial intelligence and\
              \ machine learning has accelerated. Hybrid quantum-AI systems are expected\
              \ to impact optimization, drug discovery, and climate modeling, while\
              \ AI-assisted quantum error mitigation substantially enhances quantum\
              \ technology reliability and scalability.\n## Looking Forward: The Next\
              \ Phase of Quantum Computing\nThe quantum computing industry in 2025\
              \ stands at a genuine inflection point. The fundamental barriers that\
              \ many researchers considered insurmountable—quantum error correction,\
              \ scalability, practical advantage demonstration—are being systematically\
              \ addressed through coordinated technical innovation. The industry has\
              \ transitioned from asking \"if\" quantum computing will be practically\
              \ useful to \"when\" and \"which applications will benefit first.\"\n\
              Investment capital, government support, workforce development initiatives,\
              \ and demonstrated technical breakthroughs have created a robust ecosystem\
              \ supporting commercial quantum computing development. While significant\
              \ challenges remain in scaling systems, improving error rates, and developing\
              \ applications that reliably outperform classical approaches, the trajectory\
              \ suggests that meaningful commercial quantum computing applications\
              \ could emerge within the next five to ten years for specific problem\
              \ classes in drug discovery, materials science, optimization, and cryptography.\n\
              The convergence of hardware breakthroughs, software innovation, post-quantum\
              \ cryptography standards, strategic government initiatives, and growing\
              \ workforce development efforts indicates that 2025 represents a watershed\
              \ moment for quantum computing. The technology is transitioning from\
              \ the domain of specialized researchers and theoretical physicists to\
              \ mainstream industry attention, capital allocation, and practical application\
              \ development—marking the beginning of the quantum computing age.\n\

              \ chip (Credit: IBM)\n\"There are many pillars to bringing truly useful\
              \ quantum computing to the world,\" said Jay Gambetta, Director of IBM\
              \ Research and IBM Fellow. \"We believe that IBM is the only company\
              \ that is positioned to rapidly invent and scale quantum software, hardware,\
              \ fabrication, and error correction to unlock transformative applications.\
              \ We are thrilled to announce many of these milestones today.\"\n**IBM\
              \ Quantum Computers Built to Scale Advantage**\nIBM is unveiling IBM\
              \ Quantum Nighthawk, its most advanced quantum processor yet and designed\
              \ with an architecture to complement high-performing quantum software\
              \ to deliver quantum advantage next year: the point at which a quantum\
              \ computer can solve a problem better than all classical-only methods.\n\
              IBM Nighthawk is expected to be delivered to IBM users by the end of\
              \ 2025, and will offer:\n* **120 qubits linked together with 218 next-generation\
              \ tunable couplers**to their four nearest neighbors in a square lattice,\
              \ an increase of over 20 percent more couplers compared to IBM Quantum\
              \ Heron.\n* This increased qubit connectivity will allow users to accurately\
              \ execute circuits with**30 percent more complexity**than on IBM's previous\
              \ processor while maintaining low error rates.\n* This architecture\
              \ will enable users to explore more computationally demanding problems\
              \ that require**up to 5,000 two-qubit gates**, the fundamental entangling\
              \ operations critical for quantum computation.\nIBM expects future iterations\
              \ of Nighthawk to deliver up to 7,500 gates by the end of 2026 and then\
              \ up to 10,000 gates in 2027. By 2028, Nighthawk-based systems could\
              \ support up to 15,000 two-qubit gates enabled by 1,000 or more connected\
              \ qubits extended through long-range couplers first demonstrated on\
              \ IBM experimental processors last year.\nIBM anticipates that the first\
              \ cases of verified quantum advantage will be confirmed by the wider\
              \ community by the end of 2026. To encourage their rigorous validation\
              \ and push forward the best quantum and classical approaches, IBM, Algorithmiq,\
              \ researchers at the Flatiron Institute, and[BlueQubit] are contributing\
              \ new results to an[open, community-led quantum advantage tracker] to\
              \ systematically monitor and verify emerging demonstrations of advantage.\n\
              Today, the community tracker supports three experiments for quantum\
              \ advantage across observable estimation, variational problems, and\
              \ problems with efficient classical verification. IBM encourages the\
              \ community to contribute to the tracker and push a back-and-forth with\
              \ the best classical methods.\n\"I'm proud that our team at Algorithmiq\
              \ is leading one of the three projects in the new quantum advantage\
              \ tracker. The model we designed explores regimes so complex that it\
              \ challenges all state-of-the-art classical methods tested so far,\"\
              \ said Sabrina Maniscalco, CEO and co-founder, Algorithmiq. \"We are\
              \ seeing promising experimental results, and independent simulations\
              \ from researchers at the Flatiron Institute validate its classical\
              \ hardness. These are only the first steps –quantum advantage will take\
              \ time to verify, and the tracker will let everyone follow that journey.\"\
              \n\"BlueQubit is proud to support IBM's efforts to track quantum advantage\
              \ claims and algorithms as quantum computers are entering a regime beyond\
              \ classical,\" said Hayk Tepanyan, CTO and co-founder, BlueQubit. \"\
              Through our work around peaked circuits, we are excited to help formalize\
              \ instances where quantum computers are starting to outperform classical\
              \ computers by orders of magnitude.\"\nTo pursue verified quantum advantage\
              \ on breakthrough quantum hardware, developers need to be able to highly\
              \ control their circuits and use high-performance classical computers\
              \ (HPC) to mitigate the errors that arise in computation.\nQiskit is\
              \ the world's best-performing quantum software stack, developed by IBM.\
              \ It is now giving developers more control than ever before by scaling\
              \ dynamic circuit capabilities that deliver a 24 percent increase in\
              \ accuracy at the scale of 100+ qubits. IBM is also extending Qiskit\
              \ with a new execution model that enables fine grain control and a C-API,\
              \ unlocking HPC-accelerated error mitigation capabilities that decreases\
              \ the cost of extracting accurate results by more than 100 times.\n\
              As quantum computers mature, the global quantum community is expanding\
              \ to HPC and scientific communities. IBM is delivering a C++ interface\
              \ to Qiskit, powered by a C-API, to enable users to program quantum\
              \ natively in existing HPC environments. IBM continues to lead the way\
              \ in advanced circuit execution capabilities including dynamic circuits\
              \ and increasing control over circuit execution for error mitigation.\n\
              By 2027, IBM plans to extend Qiskit with computational libraries in\
              \ areas such as machine learning and optimization to better solve fundamental\
              \ physical and chemistry challenges such as differential equations and\
              \ Hamiltonian simulations.\n**IBM Delivers Building Blocks Towards Fault-Tolerant\
              \ Quantum Computing**\nIn a parallel path, IBM is rapidly delivering\
              \ milestones towards building the world's first large-scale, fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computer by 2029.\nThe company is announcing IBM Quantum Loon,\
              \ its experimental processor that, for the first time, shows that IBM\
              \ has demonstrated all the key processor components needed for fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computing. IBM Loon will validate a new architecture to implement\
              \ and scale the components needed for practical, high-efficiency quantum\
              \ error correction. IBM has already demonstrated the breakthrough features\
              \ that will be incorporated into Loon, including the introduction of\
              \ multiple high-quality, low-loss routing layers to provide pathways\
              \ for longer, on-chip connections (or \"c-couplers\") that go beyond\
              \ nearest-neighbor couplers and physically link distant qubits together\
              \ on the same chip, as well as technologies to reset qubits between\
              \ computations.\nDelivering on another key pillar of fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computing, IBM has proven it is possible to use classical\
              \ computing hardware to accurately[decode] errors in real-time (less\
              \ than 480 nanoseconds) using qLDPC codes. This engineering feat has\
              \ been achieved a full year ahead of schedule. Together with Loon, this\
              \ demonstrates the cornerstones needed to scale qLDPC codes on high-speed,\
              \ high-fidelity superconducting qubits which form the core of IBM quantum\
              \ computers.\n**IBM Scales Fabrication to 300mm Facilities to Accelerate\
              \ Quantum Wafer Development**\nAs IBM scales its quantum computers,\
              \ it is announcing the primary fabrication of its[quantum processor\
              \ wafers] is being undertaken at an advanced 300mm wafer fabrication\
              \ facility at the Albany NanoTech Complex in New York.\nState-of-the-art\
              \ semiconductor tooling and always-on capabilities within this facility\
              \ have already accelerated the speed at which IBM can learn from, improve,\
              \ and expand the capabilities of its quantum processors; allowing the\
              \ company to increase their qubit connectivity, density, and performance.\
              \ To-date, IBM has been able to:\n* **Double the speed**of its research\
              \ and development efforts by cutting the time needed to build each new\
              \ processor by at least half;\n* **Achieve a ten-fold increase**in the\
              \ physical complexity of its quantum chips; and,\n* Enable multiple\

              \ operations required for transformative quantum applications such as\
              \ massive optimization problems, or the design of complex materials\
              \ and medicines.\n\"At IBM, our roadmap includes plans to deliver large-scale,\
              \ fault-tolerant quantum computers before the end of the decade,\" said\
              \ Jay Gambetta, Director of IBM Research and IBM Fellow. \"By working\
              \ with Cisco to explore how to link multiple quantum computers like\
              \ these together into a distributed network, we will pursue how to further\
              \ scale quantum's computational power. And as we build the future of\
              \ compute, our vision will push the frontiers of what quantum computers\
              \ can do within a larger high-performance computing architecture.\"\n\
              \"Getting quantum computing to useful scale is not just about building\
              \ bigger individual machines, it is also about connecting them together,\"\
              \ said Vijoy Pandey, GM/SVP at Outshift by Cisco. \"IBM is building\
              \ quantum computers with aggressive roadmaps for scale-up, and we are\
              \ bringing quantum networking that enables scale-out. Together, we are\
              \ solving this as a complete system problem, including the hardware\
              \ to connect quantum computers, the software to run computations across\
              \ them, and the networking intelligence that makes them work.\"\n**Scaling\
              \ a Distributed Quantum Computing Network**\nIBM and Cisco intend to\
              \ explore the development of quantum hardware and software that could\
              \ physically link many large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers\
              \ together to form networked distributed quantum computing.\nThe companies\
              \ are targeting an initial proof-of-concept demonstration by the end\
              \ of 2030, for which they plan to entangle qubits from multiple separate\
              \ quantum computers located in distinct cryogenic environments. Doing\
              \ sowill require the companies to invent new connections, including\
              \ microwave-optical transducers and a supporting software stack.\nThe[Cisco\
              \ vision] for a quantum data center introduces an architecture for quantum\
              \ networking infrastructure that could make distributed quantum computing\
              \ a reality in the near future. This vision includes a complete hardware\
              \ and software stack that aims to preserve fragile quantum states, distribute\
              \ entanglement resources, facilitate teleportation between quantum computers,\
              \ and synchronize operations with sub-nanosecond precision.\nTo scale\
              \ beyond linking two quantum computers that are separate but physically\
              \ close, IBM and Cisco are planning to explore how to transmit qubits\
              \ over longer distances, such as between buildings or data centers.\
              \ To achieve this, the companies will explore optical-photon and microwave-optical\
              \ transducer technologies, as well as investigate how they can be incorporated\
              \ into a quantum network to transfer quantum information as needed.\n\
              Linking together multiple quantum computers will require an appropriate\
              \ interface. IBM plans to build a quantum networking unit (QNU) to serve\
              \ as the interface to a quantum processing unit (QPU), with the explicit\
              \ task of taking stationary quantum information in the QPU and converting\
              \ it into \"flying\" quantum information through the QNU to then be\
              \ further linked across potentially multiple quantum computers through\
              \ a network.\nCisco's quantum network would aim to distribute the entanglements\
              \ to arbitrary pairs of these QNUs on an on-demand basis to drive the\
              \ quantum information transfer required for a given quantum algorithm\
              \ or application. Towards this goal, Cisco is developing a high-speed\
              \ software protocol framework that can continuously and dynamically\
              \ reconfigure network paths so entanglements could be distributed to\
              \ the QNUs when they are done with their partial computations.\nTogether,\
              \ the companies plan to investigate how a network bridge, comprised\
              \ of novel hardware and open-source software, could use Cisco quantum\
              \ network nodes to link many IBM QPUs within a data center through its\
              \ QNU interface. In the future, this approach could be extended to link\
              \ QPUs across multiple data centers. This would scale a larger quantum\
              \ network across even larger distances to form the groundwork for a\
              \ future quantum computing internet.\nIBM quantum computers linked by\
              \ this architecture could facilitate massively computationally demanding\
              \ workloads, including those that require high-performance computing\
              \ resources as part of a quantum-centric supercomputing framework.\n\
              Towards this vision, IBM is also working with the Superconducting Quantum\
              \ Materials and Systems Center ([SQMS]), led by Fermi National Accelerator\
              \ Laboratory, in its role as a member of four of the[U.S. Department\
              \ of Energy National Quantum Information Science and Research Centers].\
              \ Together, IBM and SQMS intend to investigate how many QNUs could be\
              \ used within quantum data centers, and they are planning an initial\
              \ demonstration of multiple connected QPUs within the next three years.\
              \ **The Foundation of a Quantum Computing Internet**\nBuilding a distributed\
              \ and scalable quantum computing network will create a pathway towards\
              \ an exponentially large computational space and enable the expansion\
              \ of diverse technologies, which could begin to form a future quantum\
              \ computing internet by the late 2030s.\nA quantum computing internet\
              \ provides a future where many distributed quantum-based technologies,\
              \ such as quantum computers, quantum sensors, and quantum communications\
              \ are connected and share information across distances, such as a metro\
              \ region and eventually, at a planetary scale. This bold vision could\
              \ facilitate new possibilities such as ultra-secure communications,\
              \ or precise monitoring of climate, weather, and seismic activity.\n\
              As another part of their current intention to collaborate, IBM and Cisco\
              \ plan to co-fund academic research and collaborative projects to advance\
              \ the broader quantum ecosystem, following a long history of fostering\
              \ research in academic and national labs.\n**About IBM**\nIBM is a leading\

              With tech stocks benefiting from sky-high valuations, one quickly-growing\
              \ corner could define the sector's next chapter. That's because quantum\
              \ computing offers \"extraordinary potential,\" according to UBS, which\
              \ highlighted several key stocks leading the industry. Quantum computing\
              \ companies have gained the attention of Wall Street over the past year,\
              \ particularly as Alphabet, IBM and Microsoft launched efforts to develop\
              \ and build the first practical quantum computer . Consequently, some\
              \ smaller, highly volatile companies, including IonQ , have soared over\
              \ the past 12 months. Quantum computing remains a fragmented and immature\
              \ market, UBS analysts led by Madeleine Jenkins wrote in a 103-page\
              \ report to clients on Monday. The bank sees the technology having the\
              \ greatest impact in three areas: molecular simulation, optimization\
              \ and AI, and cryptography. 'Meaningful breakthroughs' \"With tech valuations\
              \ at an all-time high, we believe now is the time to learn about any\
              \ potential disruptive forces. Whilst progress has been slow and there\
              \ have been many challenges, we are starting to see meaningful breakthroughs\
              \ in the quantum space,\" the 11 UBS analysts named on the report wrote.\
              \ \"By harnessing the behavior of the smallest particles, quantum computing\
              \ promises to unlock unprecedented computational power at a fraction\
              \ of today's cost,\" they continued. \"The era of quantum advantage\
              \ (where quantum significantly outperforms classical systems), could\
              \ arrive as early as the 2030s. This level of compute would require\
              \ the equivalent of 10²¹ GPUs to simulate, yet cost only tens of millions\
              \ to build.\" UBS said there are multiple ways to make a qubit —the\
              \ basic unit of quantum information —and that many industries could\
              \ adopt the technology. Superconducting and trapped-ion qubits are the\
              \ most advanced today, she said, narrowing leadership in quantum computing\
              \ to just a few stocks. \"Success will hinge on which architecture prevails;\
              \ and as it stands, we see superconducting/trapped ion as the most promising.\
              \ Alphabet/IBM are betting on superconducting qubits, while Microsoft/\
              \ Amazon -offer mixed modalities via the cloud,\" Jensen wrote. Public\
              \ companies that are pure plays on quantum technology include IonQ,\
              \ D-Wave Quantum and Rigetti Computing , the Jenkins team added. IONQ\
              \ 1Y mountain IonQ stock performance over the past year. Google, owned\
              \ by Alphabet, has been a \"pioneer\" in quantum computing and is currently\
              \ the leader in software and quantum error correction, especially with\
              \ the breakthroughs achieved by its quantum chip Willow released in\
              \ Dec. 2024, UBS said. Willow was able to reduce errors exponentially\
              \ by using more qubits and perform a standard benchmark computation\
              \ in under 5 minutes that would take one of today's fastest supercomputers\
              \ 10 septillion years, the report said. Microsoft and Amazon are more\
              \ diversified, with their mixed modalities approach to quantum development,\
              \ Jenkins wrote. Microsoft is both partnering with smaller, pureplay\
              \ quantum hardware companies, such as IonQ, and researching a new type\
              \ of topological architecture that could lead to a more stable and fast\
              \ qubit, she said. UBS rates both Microsoft and Amazon a buy, and rates\
              \ Alphabet neutral. \"Who will win out will depend largely on the modality\
              \ of qubit that succeeds first,\" the analyst said. The smaller companies\

              \ provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining\
              \ multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, in which the logical\
              \ error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However,\
              \ this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate\
              \ is below a critical threshold. Here we present two below-threshold\
              \ surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting\
              \ processors, Willow: a distance-7 code and a distance-5 code integrated\
              \ with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum\
              \ memory is suppressed by a factor of*Λ*= 2.14 ± 0.02 when increasing\
              \ the code distance by 2, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code\
              \ with 0.143% ± 0.003 per cent error per cycle of error correction.\
              \ This logical memory is also beyond breakeven, exceeding the lifetime\
              \ of its best physical qubit by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.3. Our system maintains\
              \ below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving\
              \ an average decoder latency of 63 microseconds at distance 5 up to\
              \ a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 microseconds. We also run\
              \ repetition codes up to distance 29 and find that logical performance\
              \ is limited by rare correlated error events, occurring approximately\
              \ once every hour or 3 × 109cycles. Our results indicate device performance\
              \ that, if scaled, could realize the operational requirements of large-scale\
              \ fault-tolerant quantum algorithms.\n### Similar content being viewed\

              ## Main\nQuantum computing promises computational speed-ups in quantum\
              \ chemistry[5], quantum simulation[6], cryptography[7] and optimization[8].\
              \ However, quantum information is fragile and quantum operations are\
              \ error prone. State-of-the-art many-qubit platforms have only recently\
              \ demonstrated entangling gates with 99.9% fidelity[9],[10], far short\
              \ of the &lt;10−10error rates needed for many applications[11],[12].\
              \ Quantum error correction is postulated to realize high-fidelity logical\
              \ qubits by distributing quantum information for many entangled physical\
              \ qubits to protect against errors. If the physical operations are below\
              \ a critical noise threshold, the logical error rate should be suppressed\
              \ exponentially as we increase the number of physical qubits per logical\
              \ qubit. This behaviour is expressed in the approximate relation\n$${\\\
              \\varepsilon }\\_{d}\\\\propto {\\\\left(\\\\frac{p}{{p}\\_{{\\\\rm{thr}}}}\\\
              \\right)}^{(d+1)/2}$$\n(1)\nfor error-corrected surface code logical\
              \ qubits[3],[4],[13]. Here*d*is the code distance indicating 2*d*2− 1\
              \ physical qubits used per logical qubit;*p*and*ε**d*are the physical\
              \ and logical error rates, respectively; and*p*thris the threshold error\
              \ rate of the code. Thus, when*p*≪*p*thr, the error rate of the logical\
              \ qubit is suppressed exponentially in the distance of the code, with\
              \ the error suppression factor*Λ*=*ε**d*/*ε**d*+2≈*p*thr/*p*representing\
              \ the reduction in logical error rate when increasing the code distance\
              \ by two. Although many platforms have demonstrated different features\
              \ of quantum error correction[14],[15],[16],[17],[18],[19],[20], no\
              \ quantum processor has definitively shown below-threshold performance.\n\
              Although achieving below-threshold physical error rates is itself a\
              \ formidable challenge, fault-tolerant quantum computing also imposes\
              \ requirements beyond raw performance. These include features like stability\
              \ for the hours-long timescales of quantum algorithms[21] and the active\
              \ removal of correlated error sources like leakage[22]. Fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computing also imposes requirements on classical co-processors—namely,\
              \ the syndrome information produced by the quantum device must be decoded\
              \ as fast as it is generated[23]. The fast operation times of superconducting\
              \ qubits, ranging from tens to hundreds of nanoseconds, provide an advantage\
              \ in speed but also a challenge for decoding errors both quickly and\
              \ accurately.\nIn this work, we realize surface codes operating below\
              \ the threshold on two Willow processors. Using a 72-qubit processor,\
              \ we implement a distance-5 surface code operating with an integrated\
              \ real-time decoder. Subsequently, using a 105-qubit processor with\
              \ similar performance, we realize a distance-7 surface code. These processors\
              \ demonstrate*Λ*&gt; 2 up to distance 5 and 7, respectively. Our distance-5\
              \ and distance-7 quantum memories are beyond breakeven, with distance-7\
              \ preserving quantum information for more than twice as long as its\
              \ best constituent physical qubit. To identify possible logical error\
              \ floors, we also implement high-distance repetition codes on the 72-qubit\
              \ processor, with error rates that are dominated by correlated error\
              \ events occurring once an hour. These errors, the origins of which\
              \ are not yet understood, set a current error floor of 10−10in the repetition\
              \ code. Finally, we show that we can maintain below-threshold operation\
              \ on the 72-qubit processor even when decoding in real time, meeting\
              \ the strict timing requirements imposed by the fast 1.1 μs cycle duration\
              \ of the processor.\n## A surface code memory below threshold\nWe begin\
              \ with results from our 105-qubit Willow processor depicted in Fig.[1a].\
              \ It features a square grid of superconducting transmon qubits[24] with\
              \ improved operational fidelities compared with our previously reported\
              \ Sycamore processors[17],[25]. The qubits have a mean coherence time*T*1of\
              \ 68 μs and*T*2,CPMGof 89 μs, which we attribute to improved fabrication\
              \ techniques, participation ratio engineering and circuit parameter\
              \ optimization ([Supplementary Information]). Increasing coherence contributes\
              \ to the fidelity of all of our operations, which are displayed in Fig.[1b].\n\

              \ make several improvements to decoding, using two high-accuracy offline\
              \ decoders. One is a neural network decoder[26], and the other is a\
              \ harmonized ensemble[27] of correlated minimum-weight perfect matching\
              \ decoders[28] augmented with matching synthesis[29]. These run on different\
              \ classical hardware, offering two potential paths towards real-time\
              \ decoding with higher accuracy. To adapt to device noise, we fine-tune\
              \ the neural network with processor data[26] and apply reinforcement\
              \ learning optimization to the matching graph weights[30].\nWe operate\
              \ a distance-7 surface code memory comprising 49 data qubits, 48 measure\
              \ qubits and 4 additional leakage removal qubits[17]. Summarizing, we\
              \ initiate surface code operation by preparing the data qubits in a\
              \ product state corresponding to a logical eigenstate of either the*X*Lor*Z*Lbasis\
              \ of the*ZXXZ*surface code[31]. We then repeat a variable number of\
              \ cycles of error correction, during which the measured qubits extract\
              \ parity information from the data qubits to be sent to the decoder.\
              \ After each syndrome extraction, we run data qubit leakage removal\
              \ (DQLR)[32] to ensure that leakage to higher states is short-lived.\
              \ We measure the state of the logical qubit by measuring the individual\
              \ data qubits and then check whether the corrected logical measurement\
              \ outcome of the decoder agrees with the initial logical state. It is\
              \ worth noting that fault-tolerant computation does not require active\
              \ correction of the code state; the decoder can simply reinterpret the\
              \ logical measurement outcomes[13].\nFrom the surface code data, we\
              \ can characterize the physical error rate of the processor using the\
              \ bulk error detection probability[33]. This is the proportion of weight-4\
              \ stabilizer measurement comparisons that disagree with their ideal\
              \ noiseless comparisons, thereby detecting an error. The surface code\
              \ detection probabilities are*p*det= (7.7%, 8.5%, 8.7%) for*d*= (3,5,7),\
              \ respectively. We attribute the increase in detection probability with\
              \ code size to finite size effects ([Supplementary Information]) and\
              \ parasitic couplings between qubits. We expect both effects to saturate\
              \ at larger processor sizes[34].\nWe characterize the logical performance\
              \ of our surface code by fitting the logical error per cycle*ε**d*up\
              \ to 250 cycles, averaged over the*X*Land*Z*Lbases. We average the performance\
              \ of nine different distance-3 subgrids and four different distance-5\
              \ subgrids to compare with the distance-7 code. Finally, we compute*Λ*using\
              \ linear regression of ln[*ε**d*] versus*d*. With our neural network\
              \ decoder, we observe*Λ*= 2.14 ± 0.02 and*ε*7= (1.43 ± 0.03) × 10−3(Fig.[1c,d]).\
              \ With ensembled matching synthesis, we observe*Λ*= 2.04 ± 0.02 and*ε*7= (1.71 ± 0.03) × 10−3.\n\
              Furthermore, we simulate logical qubits of higher distances using a\
              \ noise model based on the measured component error rates in Fig.[1b],\
              \ additionally including leakage and stray interactions between qubits[17]\
              \ ([Supplementary Information]). These simulations are shown alongside\
              \ the experiment (Fig.[1d], inset), both decoded with ensembled matching\
              \ synthesis. We observe reasonable agreement with experiment and decisive\
              \ error suppression, affirming that the surface codes are operating\
              \ below threshold.\nThus far, we have focused on*Λ*, because below-threshold\
              \ performance guarantees that physical qubit lifetimes and operational\
              \ fidelities can be surpassed with a sufficiently large logical qubit.\
              \ In fact, our distance-7 logical qubit already has more than double\
              \ the lifetime of its constituent physical qubits. Although comparing\
              \ physical and logical qubits is subtle owing to their different noise\
              \ processes, we plot a direct comparison between logical error rate\
              \ and physical qubit error rate averaged over the*X*and*Z*basis initializations\
              \ (Fig.[1c]). To quantify the qubit lifetime itself, we uniformly average\
              \ over pure states using the metric proposed elsewhere[16] ([Supplementary\
              \ Information]). The distance-7 logical qubit lifetime is 291 ± 6 μs,\
              \ exceeding the lifetimes of all the constituent physical qubits (median,\
              \ 85 ± 7 μs; best, 119 ± 13 μs) by a factor of 2.4 ± 0.3. Our logical\
              \ memory beyond breakeven extends previous results using bosonic codes[16],[35],[36]\
              \ to multiqubit codes, and it is a critical step towards logical operation\
              \ breakeven.\n## Logical error sensitivity\nEquipped with below-threshold\
              \ logical qubits, we can now probe the sensitivity of logical error\
              \ to various error mechanisms in this new regime. We start by testing\
              \ how logical error scales with physical error and code distance. As\
              \ shown in Fig.[2a], we inject coherent errors with variable strengths\
              \ on both data and measure qubits, and extract two quantities from each\
              \ injection experiment. First, we use detection probability as a proxy\
              \ for the total physical error rate. Second, we infer the logical error\
              \ per cycle by measuring the logical error probability at ten cycles,\
              \ decoding with correlated matching[28].\n**Fig. 2: Error sensitivity\

              \ a 72-qubit processor is used.\n[Full size image] \nIn Fig.[2b], we\
              \ plot the logical error per cycle versus detection probability for\
              \ the distance-3, distance-5 and distance-7 codes. We find that the\
              \ three curves cross near a detection probability of 20%, roughly consistent\
              \ with the crossover regime explored elsewhere[17]. The inset further\
              \ shows that detection probability acts as a good proxy for 1/*Λ*(ref.[33]\
              \ and[Supplementary Information]). When fitting power laws below the\
              \ crossing, we observe approximately 80% of the ideal value (*d*+ 1)/2\
              \ predicted by equation ([1]). We hypothesize that this deviation is\
              \ caused by excess correlations in the device. Nevertheless, higher-distance\
              \ codes show a faster reduction in logical error, realizing the characteristic\
              \ threshold behaviour in situ on a quantum processor.\nTo quantify the\
              \ impact of correlated errors along with more typical gate errors, we\
              \ form an error budget. Using the method outlined elsewhere[17],[37],\
              \ we estimate the relative contribution of different component errors\
              \ to 1/*Λ*. We run simulations based on a detailed model of our 72-qubit\
              \ processor. The model includes local noise sources due to gates and\
              \ measurements, as well as two sources of correlated error: leakage,\
              \ and stray interactions between neighbouring qubits with our CZ gates\
              \ that can induce correlated*Z**Z*and swap-like errors ([Supplementary\
              \ Information]). Figure[2c] shows our estimated error budget for 1/*Λ*in\
              \ the 72-qubit processor when decoding with correlated matching. Applying\
              \ the same decoder to experimental data yields*Λ*= 1.97 ± 0.02. The\
              \ error budget overpredicts*Λ*by 14% (Fig.[2c], ‘excess’), indicating\
              \ that most but not all error effects in our processor have been captured.\
              \ Leakage and stray interactions make up an estimated 17% of the budget;\
              \ although not a dominant contributor, we expect their importance to\
              \ increase as the error rates decrease. Moreover, out-of-model long-range\
              \ interactions or high-energy leakage might contribute to the error\
              \ budget discrepancy. Overall, both local and correlated errors from\
              \ CZ gates are the largest contributors to the error budget. Consequently,\
              \ continuing to improve both coherence and calibration will be crucial\
              \ to further reduce logical error.\nOne potential source of excess correlations\
              \ that we actively mitigate is leakage to higher excited states of our\
              \ transmon qubits. During the logical qubit operation, we remove leakage\
              \ from measure qubits using multilevel reset. For data qubits, DQLR\
              \ swaps leakage excitations to measure qubits (or additional leakage\
              \ removal qubits)[32]. To examine sensitivity to leakage, we measure\
              \ logical error probability of distance-3 and distance-5 codes in our\
              \ 72-qubit processor with and without DQLR, and the results are shown\
              \ in Fig.[2d]. Although activating DQLR does not strongly affect the\
              \ distance-3 performance, it substantially boosts the distance-5 performance,\
              \ resulting in a 35% increase in*Λ*. Comparatively, the detection probability\
              \ decreases by only 12% ([Supplementary Information]), indicating that\
              \ the detection probability is only a good proxy for logical error suppression\
              \ if the errors are uncorrelated. Overall, we find that addressing leakage\
              \ is crucial for operating surface codes with transmon qubits[15],[32],[38].\n\
              Finally, we test the sensitivity to drift. Using our 72-qubit processor,\
              \ we measure the logical performance of one distance-5 and four distance-3\
              \ codes 16 times over 15 h, and the results are shown in Fig.[2e]. Before\
              \ the repeated runs, we use a frequency optimization strategy that forecasts\
              \ defect frequencies of two-level systems (TLSs). This helps to avoid\
              \ qubits coupling to TLSs during the initial calibration as well as\
              \ for the duration of the experiments. Between every four experimental\
              \ runs, we recalibrate the processor to account for potential qubit\
              \ frequency and readout signal drift. We observe an average*Λ*= 2.18 ± 0.07\
              \ (standard deviation) and best*Λ*= 2.31 ± 0.02 ([Supplementary Information])\
              \ when decoding with the neural network. Although the performance of\
              \ the worst distance-3 quadrant appears to fluctuate due to a transient\
              \ TLS moving faster than our forecasts, this fluctuation is suppressed\
              \ in the distance-5 code, suggesting that larger codes are less sensitive\
              \ to component-level fluctuations. Moreover, the logical error rates\
              \ of experiments right after drift recalibration are not appreciably\
              \ lower than those just prior, indicating that our logical qubit is\
              \ robust to the levels of qubit frequency and readout drift present.\
              \ These results indicate that superconducting processors can remain\
              \ stable for the hours-long timescales required for large-scale fault-tolerant\
              \ algorithms[21].\n## A repetition code memory in the ultralow-error\
              \ regime\nDespite realizing below-threshold surface codes, orders of\
              \ magnitude remain between present logical error rates and the requirements\
              \ for practical quantum computation. In previous work running repetition\
              \ codes, we found that high-energy impact events occurred approximately\
              \ once every 10 s, causing large correlated error bursts that manifested\
              \ a logical error floor of around 10−6(ref.[17]). Such errors would\
              \ block our ability to run error-corrected algorithms in the future,\
              \ motivating us to reassess repetition codes on our newer devices.\n\
              Using our 72-qubit processor, we run 2 × 107shots of a distance-29 repetition\
              \ code with 1,000 cycles of error correction, with the shots split evenly\
              \ between bit- and phase-flip codes. In total, we execute 2 × 1010cycles\
              \ of error correction comprising 5.5 h of processor execution time.\
              \ Given the logical error probability*p*Lat 1,000 cycles, we infer the\
              \ logical error per cycle as\\\\({\\\\varepsilon }\\_{d}=\\\\frac{1}{2}(1-{(1-2{p}\\\
              _{{\\\\rm{L}}})}^{1/1,000})\\\\). To assess how the logical error per\
              \ cycle scales with distance*d*, we follow ref.[37] and subsample lower-distance\
              \ repetition codes from the distance-29 data.\nAveraging over bit- and\
              \ phase-flip repetition codes, we obtain*Λ*= 8.4 ± 0.1 when fitting\
              \ logical error per cycle versus code distance between*d*= 5 and*d*= 11\
              \ (Fig.[3a]). Notably, the error per cycle on the 72-qubit processor\
              \ is suppressed far below 10−6, breaking past the error floor observed\
              \ previously. We attribute the mitigation of high-energy impact failures\
              \ to gap-engineered Josephson junctions[39]. However, at code distances\
              \ of*d*≥ 15, we observe a deviation from exponential error suppression\
              \ at high distances culminating in an apparent logical error floor of\
              \ 10−10. Although we do not observe any errors at distance 29, this\
              \ is probably due to randomly decoding correctly on the few most-damaging\
              \ error bursts. Although this logical error per cycle might permit certain\
              \ fault-tolerant applications[11], it is still many orders of magnitude\
              \ higher than expected and precludes larger fault-tolerant circuits[12],[21].\n\

              \ detection patterns for these high-distance logical failures, we observe\
              \ two different failure modes ([Supplementary Information]). The first\
              \ failure mode manifests as one or two detectors suddenly increasing\
              \ in the detection probability by more than a factor of 3, settling\
              \ to their initial detection probability tens or hundreds of cycles\
              \ later ([Supplementary Information]). These less-damaging failures\
              \ could be caused by transient TLSs appearing near the operation frequencies\
              \ of a qubit, or by coupler excitations, but might be mitigated using\
              \ methods similar to refs.[38],[40]. The second and more catastrophic\
              \ failure mode manifests as many detectors simultaneously experiencing\
              \ a larger spike in the detection probability; an example is shown in\
              \ Fig.[3b]. Notably, these anisotropic error bursts are spatially localized\
              \ to neighbourhoods of roughly 30 qubits (Fig.[3b], inset). Over the\
              \ course of our 2 × 1010cycles of error correction, our processor experienced\
              \ six of these large error bursts, which are responsible for the highest-distance\
              \ failures. These bursts, such as the event shown in Fig.[3b], are different\
              \ from previously observed high-energy impact events[17]. They occur\
              \ approximately once an hour, rather than once every few seconds, and\
              \ they decay with an exponential time constant of around 400 μs, rather\
              \ than tens of milliseconds. We do not yet understand the cause of these\
              \ events, but mitigating them remains vital to building a fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computer. These results reaffirm that long repetition codes\
              \ are a crucial tool for discovering new error mechanisms in quantum\
              \ processors at the logical noise floor. However, surface codes are\
              \ larger and sensitive to more errors than repetition codes; therefore,\
              \ these events may affect the surface code performance differently.\n\
              Furthermore, although we have tested the scaling law in equation ([1])\
              \ at low distances, repetition codes enable us to scan to higher distances\
              \ and lower logical errors. Using a similar coherent error injection\
              \ method as that in the surface code, we show the scaling of logical\
              \ error versus physical error and code distance in Fig.[3c,d], observing\
              \ good agreement with*O*(*p*(*d*+1)/2) error suppression. For example,\
              \ reducing the detection probability by a factor of 2 manifests in reduction\
              \ by a factor of 250 in logical error at distance 15, consistent with\
              \ the expected*O*(*p*8) scaling. This shows the considerable error suppression\
              \ that should eventually enable large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computers,\
              \ provided we can reach similar error suppression factors in surface\
              \ codes.\n## Real-time decoding\nAlong with a high-fidelity processor,\
              \ fault-tolerant quantum computing also requires a classical co-processor\
              \ that can decode errors in real time. This is because some logical\
              \ operations are non-deterministic; they depend on logical measurement\
              \ outcomes that must be correctly interpreted on the fly. If the decoder\
              \ cannot process measurements fast enough, an increasing backlog of\
              \ syndrome information can cause an exponential increase in computation\
              \ time[23]. Real-time decoding is particularly challenging for superconducting\
              \ processors due to their speed. The throughput of transmitting, processing\
              \ and decoding the syndrome information in each cycle must keep pace\
              \ with the fast error-correcting cycle time of 1.1 μs. Using our 72-qubit\
              \ processor as a platform, we demonstrate below-threshold performance\
              \ alongside this vital module in the fault-tolerant quantum computing\
              \ stack.\nOur decoding system begins with our classical control electronics,\
              \ where the measurement signals are classified into bits and then transmitted\
              \ to a specialized workstation using low-latency Ethernet. Inside the\
              \ workstation, measurements are converted into detections and then streamed\
              \ to the real-time decoding software using a shared memory buffer. We\
              \ use the sparse blossom algorithm[41], which is optimized to quickly\
              \ resolve the local configurations of errors common in surface code\
              \ decoding, using a parallelization strategy similar to that in ref.[42].\
              \ The decoder operates on a constant-sized graph buffer that emulates\
              \ the section of the error graph being decoded at any instant, but does\
              \ not grow with the total number of cycles used in the experiment. Different\
              \ threads are responsible for different spacetime regions of the graph,\
              \ processing their requisite syndrome information as it is streamed\
              \ in[42],[43],[44],[45]. These results are fused until a global minimum-weight\
              \ perfect matching is found. The streaming decoding algorithm is illustrated\
              \ in Fig.[4a,b]. We also use a greedy edge reweighting strategy to increase\
              \ the accuracy by accounting for correlations induced by*Y*-type errors[28],[46].\n\
              **Fig. 4: Real-time decoding.**\n[![figure 4]] \n**a**, Schematic of\
              \ the streaming decoding algorithm. The decoding problems are subdivided\
              \ into blocks, with different threads responsible for different blocks.**b**,\
              \ Task graph for processing blocks. Detections are enabled to match\
              \ to the block boundaries, which will then be processed downstream during\
              \ a fuse step. If a configuration of detection events cannot be resolved\
              \ by a future fuse step, the decoder heralds failure. We use ten-cycle\
              \ blocks to ensure that the heralded failure rate is negligible compared\
              \ with the logical failure rate.**c**, Decoder latency versus experiment\
              \ duration. Each blue point corresponds to a latency measurement for\
              \ a full shot (ten shots per duration; horizontal bar, median; blue\
              \ shading, violin plot). The yellow histograms represent fine-grained\
              \ latency measurements of the time between receiving data and completing\
              \ decoding for each ten-cycle block in a shot. The values from these\
              \ fine-grained measurements, which we refer to as subshot latencies,\
              \ tend to be slightly larger than those from full-shot latency measurements\
              \ as the decoder may need to wait to fuse with detection events in future\
              \ cycles. Infrequently, we see brief subshot latency spikes above 1 ms\
              \ ([Supplementary Information]).**d**, Accuracy comparison for the surface\
              \ code with three decoders. We include the real-time decoder (RT), ensembled\
              \ matching synthesis (Ens.) and the neural network decoder (NN). Uncertainty\
              \ on each point is less than 4 × 10−4([Supplementary Information]).\
              \ To obtain the data in this figure, a 72-qubit processor is used.\n\
              [Full size image] \nIn Fig.[4c], we report the decoder latency, which\
              \ we define as the time between the decoding software receiving the\
              \ final cycle of syndrome measurements and the time at which the decoder\
              \ returns its correction. For our distance-5 surface code, we test different\
              \ problem sizes by increasing the number of error correction cycles\
              \ up to 106. We observe that the average decoder latency remains roughly\
              \ constant at a net average of 63 ± 17 μs independent of the length\
              \ of the experiment (up to 1.1 s), indicating that the decoding problem\
              \ is being processed in real time. This latency will eventually lower\
              \ bound the reaction time of the logical processor when enacting non-Clifford\
              \ gates. Other contributions to the reaction time include the data transmission\
              \ time (which we estimate to be less than 10 μs) and feedback (which\
              \ we have not yet implemented). Moreover, our decoder latency scales\
              \ with the code size, underscoring the need for further optimization.\n\
              Importantly, we are able to maintain below-threshold performance even\
              \ under the strict timing requirements imposed by real-time decoding.\
              \ We run a dedicated experiment on our 72-qubit processor to compare\
              \ real-time decoding to high-accuracy offline neural network decoding\
              \ of the same data, with the results shown in Fig.[4d]. Our real-time\
              \ decoder achieves*ε*5= 0.35% ± 0.01% and*Λ*= 2.0 ± 0.1 using a device-data-independent\
              \ prior. Meanwhile, the neural network decoder achieves*ε*5= 0.269% ± 0.008%\
              \ and*Λ*= 2.18 ± 0.09 when later decoding offline. The modest reduction\
              \ in accuracy when comparing the real-time decoder with an offline decoder\
              \ is expected as the real-time decoder must operate substantially faster.\
              \ It requires a throughput of less than 1.1 μs per cycle compared with\
              \ the 24 μs per cycle of the neural network[26]. However, we expect\
              \ that many of our high-accuracy decoding methods can eventually be\
              \ made real time by introducing techniques like layered or windowed\
              \ decoding[27],[43],[44].\n## Outlook\nIn this work, we have demonstrated\
              \ surface code memory below the threshold in our new Willow architecture.\
              \ Each time the code distance increases by two, the logical error per\
              \ cycle is reduced by more than half, culminating in a distance-7 logical\
              \ lifetime of more than double its best constituent physical qubit lifetime.\
              \ This signature of exponential logical error suppression with code\
              \ distance forms the foundation of running large-scale quantum algorithms\
              \ with error correction.\nOur error-corrected processors also demonstrate\
              \ other key advances towards fault-tolerant quantum computing. We achieve\
              \ repeatable performance for more than several hours and run experiments\
              \ up to 106cycles without deteriorating performance, both of which are\
              \ necessary for future large-scale fault-tolerant algorithms. Furthermore,\
              \ we have engineered a real-time decoding system with only a modest\
              \ reduction in accuracy compared with our offline decoders.\nEven so,\
              \ many challenges remain ahead of us. Although we might, in principle,\
              \ achieve low logical error rates by scaling up our current processors,\
              \ it would be resource intensive in practice. Extrapolating the projections\
              \ shown in Fig.[1d], achieving a 10−6error rate would require a distance-27\
              \ logical qubit using 1,457 physical qubits. Scaling up will bring additional\
              \ challenges in real-time decoding as the syndrome measurements per\
              \ cycle increase quadratically with the code distance. Our repetition\
              \ code experiments also identify a noise floor at an error rate of 10−10caused\
              \ by correlated bursts of errors. Identifying and mitigating this error\
              \ mechanism will be integral to running larger quantum algorithms.\n\
              However, quantum error correction also provides us exponential leverage\
              \ in reducing logical errors with processor improvements. For example,\
              \ reducing physical error rates by a factor of two would improve the\
              \ distance-27 logical performance by four orders of magnitude, well\
              \ into algorithmically relevant error rates[11],[12]. We further expect\
              \ these overheads to reduce with advances in error correction protocols[47],[48],[49],[50],[51],[52],[53]\
              \ and decoding[54],[55],[56].\nThe purpose of quantum error correction\
              \ is to enable large-scale quantum algorithms. Although this work focuses\
              \ on building a robust memory, additional challenges will arise in logical\
              \ computation[57],[58]. On the classical side, we must ensure that software\
              \ elements including our calibration protocols, real-time decoders and\
              \ logical compilers can scale to the sizes and complexities needed to\
              \ run multiple surface code operations[59]. With below-threshold surface\
              \ codes, we have demonstrated processor performance that can scale in\
              \ principle, but which we must now scale in practice.\n## Data availability\n\

              * Link\nSANTA BARBARA, California, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Google[(GOOGL.O),\
              \ opens new tab] on Monday said that it has overcome a key challenge\
              \ in quantum computing with a new generation of chip, solving a computing\
              \ problem in five minutes that would take a classical computer more\
              \ time than the history of the universe.\nLike other tech giants such\
              \ as Microsoft[(MSFT.O), opens new tab] and International Business Machines[(IBM.N),\
              \ opens new tab], Alphabet&#x27;s Google is chasing quantum computing\
              \ because it promises computing speeds far faster than today&#x27;s\
              \ fastest systems. While the math problem solved by the company&#x27;s\
              \ Santa Barbara, California quantum lab does not have commercial applications,\
              \ Google hopes quantum computers will one day solve problems in medicine,\
              \ battery chemistry and artificial intelligence that are out of reach\
              \ for today&#x27;s computers.\nSign up[here.] \nThe results released\
              \ Monday came from a new chip called Willow that has 105 &quot;qubits,&quot;\
              \ which are the building blocks of quantum computers. Qubits are fast\
              \ but error-prone, because they can be jostled by something as small\
              \ as a subatomic particle from events in outer space.\nAs more qubits\
              \ are packed onto a chip, those errors can add up to make the chip no\
              \ better than a conventional computer chip. So since the 1990s, scientists\
              \ have been working on quantum error-correction.\nIn a paper published\
              \ in the journal Nature on Monday, Google said that it has found a way\
              \ to string together the Willow chip&#x27;s qubits so that error rates\
              \ go down as the number of qubits goes up. The company also says it\
              \ can correct errors in real time, a key step toward making its quantum\
              \ machines practical.\nItem 1 of 4 A person shows Google Quantum AI&#x27;s\

              \ Neven, who leads the Google Quantum AI unit, said in an interview.\n\
              In 2019, IBM challenged Google&#x27;s claim that Google&#x27;s quantum\
              \ chip solved a problem that would take a classical computer 10,000\
              \ years, saying the problem could be solved in two-and-a-half days using\
              \ different technical assumptions about a classical system.\nIn a blog\
              \ post Monday, Google said it took some of those concerns into account\
              \ in its newest estimates. Even under the most idealistic conditions,\
              \ Google said a classical computer would still take a billion years\
              \ to get the same results as its newest chip.\nSome of Google&#x27;s\
              \ rivals are producing chips with[a larger number of qubits] than Google,\
              \ but Google is focused on making the most reliable qubits it can, Anthony\
              \ Megrant, chief architect for Google Quantum AI, said in an interview.\n\
              Google fabricated its previous chips in a shared facility at the University\
              \ of California, Santa Barbara, but built its own dedicated fabrication\
              \ facility to produce its Willow chips. Megrant said that new facility\
              \ will speed up how fast Google can make future chips, which are chilled\
              \ in huge refrigerators called cryostats to run experiments.\n&quot;If\
              \ we have a good idea, we want somebody on the team to be able to ...\
              \ get that into the clean room and into one of these cryostats as fast\
              \ as possible, so we can get lots of cycles of learning,&quot; Megrant\
              \ said.\nReporting by Stephen Nellis in Santa Barbara, California; editing\

              \ or longer than the age of the universe.\nThat&rsquo;s a big jump from\
              \ 2019 when Google announced its[quantum processor could complete] a\
              \ mathematical equation in three minutes, as opposed to 10,000 years\
              \ on a supercomputer. IBM[disputed the claim] at the time.\nAlong with\
              \ more powerful performance, researchers also found a way to reduce\
              \ errors, something Google calls &ldquo;one of the greatest challenges\
              \ in quantum computing.&rdquo; Instead of bits, which represent either\
              \ 1 or 0, quantum computing uses qubits,[a unit that can exist in multiple\
              \ states] at the same time, such as 1, 0, and anything in between.\n\
              As noted by Google, qubits are prone to errors because they &ldquo;have\
              \ a tendency to rapidly exchange information with their environment.&rdquo;\
              \ However, Google&rsquo;s researchers discovered a way to reduce errors\
              \ by introducing more qubits to a system and were able to correct them\
              \ in real time. Their findings were[published in*Nature*].\n&ldquo;This\
              \ historic accomplishment is known in the field as &lsquo;below threshold&rsquo;\
              \ &mdash; being able to drive errors down while scaling up the number\
              \ of qubits,&rdquo; Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven writes on\
              \ Google&rsquo;s blog. &ldquo;You must demonstrate being below threshold\
              \ to show real progress on error correction, and this has been an outstanding\
              \ challenge since[quantum error correction] was introduced by Peter\
              \ Shor in 1995.&rdquo;\nWillow, which has 105 qubits, &ldquo;now has\
              \ best-in-class performance,&rdquo; according to Neven.[Microsoft],[Amazon],\
              \ and[IBM] are working on quantum computing systems of their own.\n\
              Google&rsquo;s next goal is to perform a first &ldquo;useful, beyond-classical&rdquo;\
              \ computation that is both &ldquo;relevant to a real-world application&rdquo;\
              \ and one that typical computers can&rsquo;t achieve. Going forward,\
              \ Neven says quantum technology will be &ldquo;indispensable&rdquo;\
              \ for collecting AI training data, eventually helping to &ldquo;discover\
              \ new medicines, designing more efficient batteries for electric cars,\
              \ and accelerating progress in fusion and new energy alternatives.&rdquo;\n\

              \ Concept]] Using a novel double-transmon coupler, researchers have\
              \ attained gate fidelities up to 99.98%, paving the way for more reliable\
              \ and scalable quantum computing. Credit: SciTechDaily.com\n\n**Researchers\
              \ have achieved high gate fidelities up to 99.98% using a new double-transmon\
              \ coupler. This development enhances quantum computing performance and\
              \ supports the advancement toward fault-tolerant systems.**\n\nResearchers\
              \ from the RIKEN Center for Quantum Computing and Toshiba have developed\
              \ a quantum computer gate using a double-transmon coupler (DTC), a device\
              \ previously proposed in theory to enhance the fidelity of quantum gates\
              \ significantly. With this innovation, the team achieved a fidelity\
              \ of 99.92% for a two-qubit device known as a CZ gate and 99.98% for\
              \ a single-qubit gate.\n\nThis milestone, part of the Q-LEAP project,\
              \ not only improves the performance of noisy intermediate-scale quantum\
              \ (NISQ) devices but also lays the groundwork for fault-tolerant quantum\
              \ computation through more effective error correction.\n\n#### Enhanced\
              \ Gate Fidelity With DTC\n\nThe DTC is a novel tunable coupler comprising\
              \ two fixed-frequency transmons—a type of qubit designed to be less\
              \ sensitive to noise caused by charge—connected through a loop containing\
              \ an additional Josephson junction. This architecture addresses a critical\
              \ challenge in quantum computing: achieving high-fidelity connections\
              \ between qubits. High fidelity is crucial for reducing errors and increasing\
              \ the reliability of quantum computations.\n\nThe DTC stands out by\
              \ minimizing residual interactions while enabling fast, high-fidelity\
              \ two-qubit gate operations, even for qubits with significant frequency\
              \ differences (detuning). While single-qubit gates have reached fidelity\
              \ levels of 99.9%, two-qubit gates have typically had error rates of\
              \ 1% or more, primarily due to unwanted qubit interactions, such as\
              \ the ZZ interaction. The DTC approach directly tackles these issues,\
              \ representing a major advance in quantum gate technology.\n\n[![High-Fidelity\

              \ pictures of the areas (dotted rectangles) containing Josephson junctions.\
              \ Credit: RIKEN\n\n#### Optimizing Quantum Error Correction\n\nA key\
              \ of the current work, published in _Physical Review X_, is the construction\
              \ of a gate using state-of-the-art fabrication techniques using a type\
              \ of machine learning known as reinforcement learning. This approach\
              \ allowed the researchers to translate the theoretical potential of\
              \ the DTC into practical application. They used this approach to achieve\
              \ a balance between two types of remaining error—leakage error and decoherence\
              \ error—that remained within the system, selecting a length of 48 nanoseconds\
              \ as an optimal compromise between the two error sources. Thanks to\
              \ this, they were able to achieve fidelity levels that are among the\
              \ highest reported in the field.\n\n#### Future Prospects in Quantum\
              \ Technology\n\nAccording to Yasunobu Nakamura, director of the RIKEN\
              \ Center for Quantum Computing, “By reducing the error rates in quantum\
              \ gates, we have made more reliable and accurate quantum computations\
              \ possible. This is particularly important for the development of fault-tolerant\
              \ quantum computers, which are the future of quantum computing.”\n\n\
              He continues, “This device’s ability to perform effectively with highly\
              \ detuned qubits makes it a versatile and competitive building block\
              \ for various quantum computing architectures. This adaptability ensures\
              \ that it can be integrated into existing and future superconducting\
              \ quantum processors, enhancing their overall performance and scalability.\
              \ In the future, we plan to try to achieve a shorter gate length, as\
              \ this could help minimize the incoherent error.”\n\nReference: “Realization\

              \ * * ![gettyimages-1136623583] \nMirageC/Getty Images\nEarlier this\
              \ month, Google&apos;s quantum computing scientists demonstrated a breakthrough\
              \ that indicates&#xA0;[quantum computing] is for real -- and will be\
              \ able to find its place among other kinds of computers as a valuable\
              \ resource. But much remains to be done.&#xA0;\nGoogle&apos;s latest\
              \ quantum chip, which is called Willow and fabricated in the company&apos;s\
              \ Santa Barbara research facility, is a memory chip. It doesn&apos;t\
              \ actually process any functions; it simply stores a bit to be read.\
              \ Doing anything with it will involve the long work of developing logical\
              \ circuits to make use of the &quot;qubits&quot; that make up the chip.&#xA0;\n\
              **Also:[OpenAI&apos;s o3 isn&apos;t AGI yet but it just did something\
              \ no other AI has done] **\nThe fundamental breakthrough, as explained\
              \ in Nature magazine (which[published Google&apos;s early-release research\
              \ paper]), is to show that the errors of qubits can be reduced below\
              \ a level of noise called a threshold, and -- as that happens -- the\
              \ machine can reliably represent information. That is, represent it\
              \ with a tolerable level of error.\n![google-2024-willow-splash-graphic]\
              \ \nGoogle&apos;s Willow quantum computing chip has 105 physical qubits\
              \ crafted from superconducting &quot;transmons,&quot; a technique pioneered\
              \ in 2007 at Yale University.\nGoogle\nConsider the basic proposition\
              \ of today&apos;s quantum hardware. To make any quantum &quot;bit&quot;\
              \ of information, you have to combine multiple*physical*quantum bits,\
              \ or qubits, which can be made of a variety of materials. Google&apos;s\
              \ Willow is a follow-on to Sycamore, last year&apos;s chip, and both\
              \ use a superconducting form of capacitor, cooled to well below zero,\
              \ called a &quot;Transmon,&quot; which was&#xA0;[developed at Yale University\
              \ 20 years ago.] &#xA0;\nUsing Transmons or other forms of physical\
              \ qubits, researchers at numerous institutions, not just Google, have\
              \ been making progress for years in combining multiple qubits to make\
              \ a single &quot;logical&quot; qubit. A physical qubit only lasts for\
              \ billionths of a second, so its lifetime isn&apos;t long enough for\
              \ the &quot;decoder&quot; circuitry of the quantum machine to read its\
              \ information.\n**Also:[AI agents might be the new workforce, but they\
              \ still need a manager] **\nThe logical qubit, which is really a summary\
              \ of all the physical qubits, can persist long enough -- double the\
              \ lifespan of a physical qubit -- that its value can be readable and,\
              \ therefore, useful.\nThe challenge has been to suppress the errors\
              \ that arise as the multiple qubits succumb to environmental noise.\
              \ Too much noise and the logical qubit becomes useless. Error correction\
              \ of various sorts has been developed for years now, but Google&apos;s\
              \ breakthrough is the first to reduce the individual errors in the physical\
              \ qubits below a level necessary to produce a logical qubit that&apos;s\
              \ workable -- the threshold level.&#xA0;\n![google-2024-willow-quantum-chip-system-metrics]\
              \ \nKey stats for Google&apos;s Willow quantum chip.\nGoogle\nThe key\
              \ to Google&apos;s Willow chip, which boosts the number of physical\
              \ qubits to 105, is a variety of physical changes to its fabrication,\
              \ which lead to reduced noise in each physical qubit. The result is\
              \ that &quot;each time the code distance increases by two, the logical\
              \ error per cycle is reduced by more than half,&quot; as Google&apos;s\
              \ lead author, Rajeev Acharya, and collaborators write.&#xA0;\nThe term\
              \ &quot;distance&quot; here refers to how many physical qubits are used,\
              \ so the implication is that as more and more physical qubits are strung\
              \ together, extending the total distance of the arrangement, the error\
              \ rate of the logical qubit decreases steadily.\nThat&apos;s exciting\
              \ because reliable logical qubits can be*scaled*; that is, more and\
              \ more physical qubits can be added while keeping noise below the threshold\
              \ level, resulting in a predictably reliable logical qubit.\n**Also:**[**A\
              \ buyer&apos;s guide to quantum as a service: Qubits for hire**] \n\
              Why that&apos;s profound: Scaling is the fundamental breakthrough of\
              \ traditional computer chips, the ability to assemble billions of transistors\
              \ on a square of silicon, to create increasingly powerful circuits.\
              \ If you can reliably scale now physical qubits, you can see a path\
              \ to creating logical qubit circuits in the same way, with increasing\
              \ power and performance.&#xA0;\nThe coverage of Google&apos;s announcement\
              \ about Willow in[Nature magazine] &#xA0;and its competitor[Science\
              \ magazine], cites numerous experts in the field. The consensus, as\
              \ Nature&apos;s article states, is that this is &quot;a truly remarkable\
              \ breakthrough.&quot;\nStill, it&apos;s worth keeping in mind how much\
              \ work is yet to be done. For one thing, the breakthrough in threshold\
              \ error doesn&apos;t mean the work of reducing errors is over. Scaling\
              \ the error rates now has to reach a much higher level of accuracy for\
              \ logical qubits in practice, as Acharya and the team note.\n**Also:&#xA0;**[**What\
              \ is quantum computing today? The how, why, and when of a paradigm shift**]\
              \ \n&quot;Orders of magnitude remain between present logical error rates\
              \ and the requirements for practical quantum computation,&quot; they\
              \ write. For example, there can be &quot;high-energy impact events&quot;\
              \ that take place in the surrounding environment, &quot;approximately\
              \ once every ten seconds,&quot; that destroy reliable, error-free logical\
              \ qubit operation.\nIn other words, the fact that logical qubits can\
              \ be scaled, though a breakthrough, just means that researchers now\
              \ have a long journey ahead to actually perform that scaling with both\
              \ larger chips (more Transmons), and also improve ways of detecting\
              \ and mitigating logical errors. Google says they have a roadmap for\
              \ how to get there.\n![google-2024-quantum-computing-roadmap] \nGoogle&apos;s\
              \ quantum computing roadmap.\nGoogle\nBeyond the scaling issue, there&apos;s\
              \ the limitation of the current device type: It&apos;s not yet a computer\
              \ chip.\nThe Willow&apos;s logical qubit is the equivalent of a capacitor:\
              \ it stores a bit. It doesn&apos;t do anything with that bit -- yet.\
              \ It&apos;s just a memory for holding information. To perform an operation,\
              \ it will need to be extended to combinations of several logical qubits\
              \ linked to form logical operations such as adding and multiplying.\
              \ (The actual form of logical operations for a quantum processor may\
              \ be rather more abstruse, but you get the idea.)\n**Also:&#xA0;**[**What\
              \ is quantum computing? Everything you need to know about the strange\
              \ world of quantum computers**] \nAs John Preskill, a theoretical physicist\
              \ at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, told Nature&apos;s\
              \ Davide Castelvecchi, &quot;We want to do protected qubit operations,\
              \ not just memory.&quot; The longstanding goal of the Google team --\
              \ to do real operations -- is to have a*million-qubit*chip, meaning,\
              \ a million physical qubits, to have enough to have logical qubits that\
              \ can be strung together to form true circuits for true computation.\n\
              To get from here to actual*circuits --*&#xA0;collections of logical\
              \ qubits that do something -- is a very long journey, both for the actual\
              \ chip and for the software that will ultimately make working quantum\
              \ computers. Probably, today&apos;s C++ and Python won&apos;t be enough.\n\
              It&apos;s certainly a breakthrough; just be mindful of all the work\
              \ ahead. &#xA0;\n#### Google\n[\n![EMBARGO - Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold\

              \ 2025*\nToday I’m delighted to announce Willow, our latest quantum\
              \ chip. Willow has state-of-the-art performance across a number of metrics,\
              \ enabling two major achievements.\n* The first is that Willow can reduce\
              \ errors exponentially as we scale up using*more*qubits. This cracks\
              \ a key challenge in quantum error correction that the field has pursued\
              \ for almost 30 years.\n* Second, Willow performed a standard benchmark\
              \ computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s[fastest\
              \ supercomputers] 10 septillion (that is, 1025) years —a number that\
              \ vastly exceeds the age of the Universe.\nThe Willow chip is a major\
              \ step on a journey that began over 10 years ago. When I founded Google\
              \ Quantum AI in 2012, the vision was to build a useful, large-scale\
              \ quantum computer that could harness quantum mechanics —the “operating\
              \ system” of nature to the extent we know it today —to benefit society\
              \ by advancing scientific discovery, developing[helpful applications],\
              \ and tackling some of society's greatest challenges. As part of Google\
              \ Research, our team has charted a long-term[roadmap], and Willow moves\
              \ us significantly along that path towards commercially relevant applications.\n\
              ## Exponential quantum error correction —below threshold!\nErrors are\
              \ one of the greatest challenges in quantum computing, since qubits,\
              \ the units of computation in quantum computers, have a tendency to\
              \ rapidly exchange information with their environment, making it difficult\
              \ to protect the information needed to complete a computation. Typically\
              \ the more qubits you use, the more errors will occur, and the system\
              \ becomes classical.\nToday in[Nature], we published results showing\
              \ that[**the more qubits we use in Willow, the more we*****reduce*****errors**]\
              \ **, and the more quantum the system becomes**. We tested ever-larger\
              \ arrays of physical qubits, scaling up from a grid of 3x3 encoded qubits,\
              \ to a grid of 5x5, to a grid of 7x7 —and each time, using our latest\
              \ advances in quantum error correction, we were able to cut the error\
              \ rate in half. In other words, we achieved an exponential reduction\
              \ in the error rate. This historic accomplishment is known in the field\
              \ as “below threshold” —being able to drive errors down while scaling\
              \ up the number of qubits. You must demonstrate being below threshold\
              \ to show real progress on error correction, and this has been an outstanding\
              \ challenge since[quantum error correction] was introduced by Peter\
              \ Shor in 1995.\nThere are other scientific “firsts” involved in this\
              \ result as well. For example, it’s also one of the first compelling\
              \ examples of real-time error correction on a superconducting quantum\
              \ system —crucial for any useful computation, because if you can’t correct\
              \ errors fast enough, they ruin your computation before it’s done. And\
              \ it’s a \"beyond breakeven\" demonstration, where our arrays of qubits\
              \ have longer lifetimes than the individual physical qubits do, an unfakable\
              \ sign that error correction is improving the system overall.\nAs the\
              \ first system below threshold, this is the most convincing prototype\
              \ for a scalable logical qubit built to date. It’s a strong sign that\
              \ useful, very large quantum computers can indeed be built. Willow brings\
              \ us closer to running practical, commercially-relevant algorithms that\
              \ can’t be replicated on conventional computers.\n## 10 septillion years\
              \ on one of today’s fastest supercomputers\nAs a measure of Willow’s\
              \ performance, we used the[random circuit sampling (RCS) benchmark].\
              \ Pioneered by our team and now widely used as a standard in the field,\
              \ RCS is the classically hardest benchmark that can be done on a quantum\
              \ computer today. You can think of this as an entry point for quantum\
              \ computing —it checks whether a quantum computer is doing something\
              \ that couldn’t be done on a classical computer. Any team building a\
              \ quantum computer should check first if it can beat classical computers\
              \ on RCS; otherwise there is strong reason for skepticism that it can\
              \ tackle more complex quantum tasks. We’ve consistently used this benchmark\
              \ to assess progress from one generation of chip to the next —we reported\
              \ Sycamore results in[October 2019] and again recently in[October 2024].\n\
              Willow’s performance on this benchmark is astonishing: It performed\
              \ a computation in under five minutes that would take one of today’s[fastest\
              \ supercomputers] 1025or 10 septillion years. If you want to write it\
              \ out, it’s 10,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years. This mind-boggling\
              \ number exceeds known timescales in physics and vastly exceeds the\
              \ age of the universe. It lends credence to the notion that quantum\
              \ computation occurs in many parallel universes, in line with the idea\
              \ that we live in a multiverse, a[prediction] first made by David Deutsch.\n\
              These latest results for Willow, as shown in the plot below, are our\
              \ best so far, but we’ll continue to make progress.\nComputational costs\
              \ are heavily influenced by available memory. Our estimates therefore\
              \ consider a range of scenarios, from an ideal situation with unlimited\
              \ memory (▲) to a more practical, embarrassingly parallelizable implementation\
              \ on GPUs (⬤).\n![A chart comparing the performance of different quantum\
              \ computing platforms, on the task of random circuit sampling (RCS).]\
              \ \nOur assessment of how Willow outpaces one of the world’s most powerful\
              \ classical supercomputers,[Frontier], was based on conservative assumptions.\
              \ For example, we assumed full access to secondary storage, i.e., hard\
              \ drives, without any bandwidth overhead —a generous and unrealistic\
              \ allowance for Frontier. Of course, as happened after we announced\
              \ the first[beyond-classical computation in 2019], we expect classical\
              \ computers to keep improving on this benchmark, but the rapidly growing\
              \ gap shows that quantum processors are peeling away at a double exponential\
              \ rate and will continue to vastly outperform classical computers as\
              \ we scale up.\n## State-of-the-art performance\nWillow was fabricated\
              \ in our new, state-of-the-art fabrication facility in Santa Barbara\
              \ —one of only a few facilities in the world built from the ground up\
              \ for this purpose. System engineering is key when designing and fabricating\
              \ quantum chips: All components of a chip, such as single and two-qubit\
              \ gates, qubit reset, and readout, have to be simultaneously well engineered\
              \ and integrated. If any component lags or if two components don't function\
              \ well together, it drags down system performance. Therefore, maximizing\
              \ system performance informs all aspects of our process, from chip architecture\
              \ and fabrication to gate development and calibration. The achievements\
              \ we report assess quantum computing systems holistically, not just\
              \ one factor at a time.\nWe’re focusing on quality, not just quantity\
              \ —because just producing larger numbers of qubits doesn’t help if they’re\
              \ not high enough quality. With 105 qubits, Willow now has best-in-class\
              \ performance across the two system benchmarks discussed above: quantum\
              \ error correction and random circuit sampling. Such algorithmic benchmarks\
              \ are the best way to measure overall chip performance. Other more specific\
              \ performance metrics are also important; for example, our T1times,\
              \ which measure how long qubits can retain an excitation —the key quantum\
              \ computational resource —are now approaching 100 µs (microseconds).\
              \ This is an impressive \\~5x improvement over our previous generation\
              \ of chips. If you want to evaluate quantum hardware and compare across\
              \ platforms, here is a table of key specifications:\nWillow’s performance\
              \ across a number of metrics.\n![a table chart reading &quot;Willow\
              \ System Metrics&quot; with columns showing details like number of qubits\
              \ (105) and average connectivity (3.47)] \n## What’s next with Willow\
              \ and beyond\nThe next challenge for the field is to demonstrate a first\
              \ \"useful, beyond-classical\" computation on today's quantum chips\
              \ that is relevant to a real-world application. We’re optimistic that\
              \ the Willow generation of chips can help us achieve this goal. So far,\
              \ there have been two separate types of experiments. On the one hand,\
              \ we’ve run the RCS benchmark, which measures performance against classical\
              \ computers but has no known real-world applications. On the other hand,\
              \ we’ve done scientifically interesting simulations of quantum systems,\
              \ which have led to new scientific discoveries but are still within\
              \ the reach of classical computers. Our goal is to do both at the same\
              \ time —to step into the realm of algorithms that are beyond the reach\
              \ of classical computers**and**that are useful for real-world, commercially\
              \ relevant problems.\nRandom circuit sampling (RCS), while extremely\
              \ challenging for classical computers, has yet to demonstrate practical\
              \ commercial applications.\n![an illustrated chart reading &quot;Random\

              \ \nMy colleagues sometimes ask me why I left the burgeoning field of\
              \ AI to focus on quantum computing. My answer is that both will prove\
              \ to be the most transformational technologies of our time, but advanced\
              \ AI will significantly benefit from access to quantum computing. This\
              \ is why I named our lab Quantum AI. Quantum algorithms have fundamental\
              \ scaling laws on their side, as we’re seeing with RCS. There are similar\
              \ scaling advantages for many foundational computational tasks that\
              \ are essential for AI. So quantum computation will be indispensable\
              \ for collecting training data that’s inaccessible to classical machines,\
              \ training and optimizing certain learning architectures, and modeling\
              \ systems where quantum effects are important. This includes helping\
              \ us discover new medicines, designing more efficient batteries for\
              \ electric cars, and accelerating progress in fusion and new energy\
              \ alternatives. Many of these future game-changing applications won’t\
              \ be feasible on classical computers; they’re waiting to be unlocked\
              \ with quantum computing.\nPOSTED IN:\n### Related stories\n[\n![] \n\

              \ Willow chip has it confidently on a path to the kind of quantum computing\
              \ that could tackle seemingly insurmountable real-world problems] Google\
              \ says the Willow chip has it confidently on a path to the kind of quantum\
              \ computing that could tackle seemingly insurmountable real-world problems.\n\
              Google on Monday showed off a new quantum computing chip that it said\
              \ was a major breakthrough that could bring practical quantum computing\
              \ closer to reality.\nA custom chip called \"Willow\" does in minutes\
              \ what it would take leading supercomputers 10 septillion years to complete,\
              \ according to Google Quantum AI founder Hartmut Neven.\n\"Written out,\
              \ there is a 1 with 25 zeros,\" Neven said of the time span while briefing\
              \ journalists. \"A mind-boggling number.\"\nNeven's team of about 300\
              \ people at Google is on a mission to build quantum computing capable\
              \ of handling otherwise unsolvable problems like safe fusion power and\
              \ stopping climate change.\n\"We see Willow as an important step in\
              \ our journey to build a useful quantum computer with practical applications\
              \ in areas like drug discovery, fusion energy, battery design and more,\"\
              \ said Google CEO Sundar Pichai on X.\nA quantum computer that can tackle\
              \ these challenges is still years away, but Willow marks a significant\
              \ step in that direction, according to Neven and members of his team.\n\
              While still in its early stages, scientists believe that superfast quantum\
              \ computing will eventually be able to power innovation in a range of\
              \ fields.\nQuantum research is seen as a critical field and both the\
              \ United States and China have been investing heavily in the area, while\
              \ Washington has also placed restrictions on the export of the sensitive\
              \ technology.\nOlivier Ezratty, an independent expert in quantum technologies,\
              \ told AFP in October that private and public investment in the field\
              \ has totaled around $20 billion worldwide over the past five years.\n\
              Regular computers function in binary fashion: they carry out tasks using\
              \ tiny fragments of data known as bits that are only ever either expressed\
              \ as 1 or 0.\nBut fragments of data on a quantum computer, known as\
              \ qubits, can be both 1 and 0 at the same time—allowing them to crunch\
              \ an enormous number of potential outcomes simultaneously.\nCrucially,\
              \ Google's chip demonstrated the ability to reduce computational errors\
              \ exponentially as it scales up—a feat that has eluded researchers for\
              \ nearly 30 years.\nThe breakthrough in error correction, published\
              \ in leading science journal*Nature*, showed that adding more qubits\
              \ to the system actually reduced errors rather than increasing them—a\
              \ fundamental requirement for building practical quantum computers.\n\
              Error correction is the \"end game\" in quantum computing and Google\
              \ is \"confidently progressing\" along the path, according to Google\
              \ director of quantum hardware Julian Kelly.\n**More information:**Quantum\

              \ \n\nSource: Marko Aliaksandr via Shutterstock\n\nThe quest to create\
              \ a useful quantum computer reached a significant milestone at the end\
              \ of 2024 with Google's announcement of its Willow chip. The chip promises\
              \ reduced noise and fewer errors as the number of qubits grows — a necessary\
              \ step to advance toward advanced quantum computing. Despite some debate\
              \ on when these systems will actually become available, [experts still\
              \ advise making plans] and migrating to post-quantum technologies.\n\
              \nThe shift from today's technology, where adding more qubits adds more\
              \ noise, to a future where increasing the number of qubits exponentially\
              \ reduces the amount of noise — an achievement known as \"threshold\
              \ scalability\" — conquers a major impediment to quantum computers.\
              \ Creating a 1,000-qubit quantum computer requires [foundational advancements]\
              \ beyond today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) computers to\
              \ create reliable logical qubits that can be used in easily scaled architectures.\n\
              \nThe Google announcement marks \"a significant leap forward,\" says\
              \ Karl Holmqvist, founder and CEO at Lastwall, an identity services\
              \ provider focused on quantum resilience.\n\n\"Companies should be starting\
              \ to get concerned about a usable quantum computer now,\" Holmqvist\
              \ says. \"This is not because there is proof of a cryptographically\
              \ relevant quantum computer yet. It is because there are active campaigns\
              \ that are currently taking place to capture encrypted data and store\
              \ it until there is a system that can break our asymmetric encryption.\"\
              \n\nRelated: [Dark Reading Confidential: Quantum Has Landed, So Now\
              \ What?] \n\nThe threat posed by quantum computers seems to be becoming\
              \ more real every day. In addition to [Google's Willow chip announcement],\
              \ Microsoft announced in November that it had reached a [24-qubit milestone\
              \ with Atom Computing] using lasers, while Japanese researchers from\
              \ the Riken Quantum Computer Research Center [announced a \"general-purpose\"\
              \ optical quantum computer].\n\nThe future implications could be dire.\
              \ The Hudson Institute, a free-market think tank, warns that quantum\
              \ computers pose a systemic cyber-risk to financial systems; it published\
              \ two papers describing risks of disruption to [the US financial system]\
              \ and [cryptocurrencies].\n\n## Less Than a Decade Away?\n\nQuantum\
              \ computing is one of those technologies that many have perennially\
              \ predicted is [only a decade away]. Currently, the median estimate\
              \ among experts is that within 15 years, a quantum computer will be\
              \ able to break RSA-2048 in 24 hours, [according to the \"Quantum Threat\
              \ Timeline Report 2024.\"] \n\n![GRI quantum computing survey] \n\n\
              The middle-of-the-road estimate of when quantum computers will pose\
              \ an encryption threat is less than 15 years. Source: Global Risk Institute\n\
              \nWhile many experts see the possibility of a useful quantum computer\
              \ in less than a decade — based on three key areas: hardware progression,\
              \ error correction, and algorithm development — useful quantum computers\
              \ still have a long way to go before they become possible. For example,\
              \ while Google's work on Willow is a major step toward making error\
              \ correction — mainly a theoretical field before this decade — more\
              \ achievable in larger quantum computing chips, achieving this step\
              \ is just the second milestone out of six listed on its quantum computer\
              \ road map.\n\nRelated: [Quantum Leap: Advanced Computing Is a Vulnerable\
              \ Cyber Target] \n\nIn addition, gauging the risk is difficult, with\
              \ terms such as \"threshold scalability\" and \"quantum supercomputers\"\
              \ muddying the waters, says Rebecca Krauthamer, co-founder and CEO of\
              \ QuSecure.\n\n\"There's so much complicated vocabulary when it comes\
              \ to quantum, the thing that people need to look out for is when they\
              \ start seeing quantum computers beginning to solve problems that they\
              \ recognize,\" Krauthamer says. \"So whether it's improved battery technology,\
              \ or route optimization for self-driving cars, or optimized portfolio\
              \ management, or breaking encryption — that's the time everybody should\
              \ have already migrated to post-quantum technologies, and not just post-quantum\
              \ but crypto-agile management of cryptography.\"\n\nYet the lack of\
              \ significant benefits for the private sector could put a damper on\
              \ development. The Boston Consulting Group, for example, points out\
              \ that quantum computing programs have had difficulty converting effort\
              \ into value.\n\n\"Quantum computing today provides no tangible advantage\
              \ over classical computing in either commercial or scientific applications,\"\
              \ BCG [stated in a July analysis]. \"Though experts agree that there\
              \ are clear scientific and commercial problems for which quantum solutions\
              \ will one day far surpass the classical alternative, the newer technology\
              \ has yet to demonstrate this advantage at scale.\"\n\n## Experts Still\
              \ Urge Preparation\n\nIn addition, the point at which nation-states\
              \ could use quantum computers to break encryption could be sooner, increasing\
              \ the risk for some industries. Quantinuum, for example, accelerated\
              \ its road map for fully fault-tolerant quantum computing to 2030 and\
              \ warns that quantum secure solutions will likely be necessary before\
              \ 2035.\n\n\"Given where we stand today, the need to complete migration\
              \ to PQC \\[post-quantum computing\\] to effectively protect sensitive\
              \ data needs to be prioritized,\" says Duncan Jones, head of cybersecurity\
              \ for Quantinuum.\n\nQuantinuum expects incremental advances in the\
              \ next few years. That includes improvements in error correction and\
              \ qubit scaling, continued research into applications such as quantum\
              \ decryption, and, as a result, greater adoption of PQC technologies,\
              \ such as post-quantum encryption, quantum key distribution, and quantum\
              \ random number generation (QRNG), says the company's Jones.\n\n\"Organizations\
              \ implementing quantum-safe strategies today should focus on PQC migration\
              \ while ensuring their cryptographic foundations are as strong as possible\
              \ through the use of QRNGs,\" he says. \"This approach provides immediate\
              \ security benefits while preparing for future quantum-safe technologies.\"\
              \n\nGoogle acknowledges that while its error correction breakthrough\
              \ is significant, there is a difference between theory and practice.\n\
              \n\"We still have a long way to go before we reach our goal of building\
              \ a large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computer,\" two members of the\
              \ Google Quantum AI team [stated in a blog post]. \"The engineering\

              \ in 2024: Breakthroughs, Challenges, and What Lies Ahead\nSeptember\
              \ 5, 2024|[Microtime Computers] |\nQuantum computing (QC), once a theoretical\
              \ concept confined to academic research, has rapidly evolved into one\
              \ of the most exciting and promising fields in technology. As we move\
              \ through 2024, QC is inching closer to practical applications that\
              \ could revolutionize industries from cryptography to drug discovery.\
              \ However, alongside these breakthroughs come significant challenges\
              \ that must be addressed before quantum computing can reach its full\
              \ potential. Let&#8217;s explore the latest developments in quantum\
              \ computing, the obstacles that remain, and what the future may hold\
              \ for this transformative technology.\n## Breakthroughs in Quantum Computing\
              \ in 2024\n2024 has been a year of significant progress in the field\
              \ of QC, with several key breakthroughs that are bringing us closer\
              \ to realizing its potential:\n**1. Increased Qubit Stability and Error\
              \ Correction**\nOne of the most critical challenges in quantum computing\
              \ has always been maintaining the stability of qubits—the basic units\
              \ of quantum information. In 2024, researchers have made notable advancements\
              \ in error correction techniques, which are essential for stabilizing\
              \ qubits and reducing the errors that occur during quantum computations.\
              \ Improved error correction codes and the development of more stable\
              \ qubits, such as topological qubits, have pushed the boundaries of\
              \ what is possible, bringing us closer to achieving reliable quantum\
              \ computing.\n**2. Quantum Supremacy Milestones**\nQuantum supremacy—the\
              \ point at which a quantum computer can solve a problem that classical\
              \ computers cannot—has been a hot topic in recent years. In 2024, several\
              \ QC firms and research institutions have announced new milestones in\
              \ this area. While there is still debate over what constitutes true\
              \ quantum supremacy, the latest demonstrations have shown quantum computers\
              \ tackling increasingly complex problems, outpacing their classical\
              \ counterparts in specific tasks such as complex simulations and optimization\
              \ problems.\n**3. Advancements in Quantum Algorithms**\nThe development\
              \ of quantum algorithms has seen significant progress in 2024. New algorithms\
              \ designed to take advantage of quantum computing’s unique capabilities\
              \ are being developed, offering the potential to solve problems in fields\
              \ such as cryptography, materials science, and machine learning more\
              \ efficiently than ever before. For instance, advances in quantum algorithms\
              \ for factoring large numbers have implications for breaking traditional\
              \ encryption methods, a development that could reshape the field of[cybersecurity].\n\
              **4. Commercial Quantum[Cloud Services] **\nQuantum computing is gradually\
              \ becoming more accessible, thanks to the expansion of quantum[cloud\
              \ services] offered by tech giants such as IBM, Google, and Amazon.\
              \ In 2024, these platforms have introduced more powerful quantum processors,\
              \ allowing businesses and researchers to experiment with QC without\
              \ needing to build and maintain their own quantum hardware. These services\
              \ are making it easier for organizations to explore quantum computing\
              \ applications in a real-world context, accelerating innovation across\
              \ industries.\n## Challenges Facing Quantum Computing\nDespite these\
              \ exciting breakthroughs, significant challenges remain before quantum\
              \ computing can be fully realized and integrated into everyday use:\n\
              **1. Scalability Issues**\nWhile qubit stability has improved, scaling\
              \ quantum computers to the level necessary for solving large, complex\
              \ problems remains a daunting challenge. Building quantum computers\
              \ with millions of qubits that can operate reliably in tandem is still\
              \ beyond our current capabilities. As researchers work to overcome these\
              \ scalability issues, the goal of creating large-scale quantum computers\
              \ remains on the horizon.\n**2. Quantum Error Correction**\nAlthough\
              \ error correction has improved, it is not yet at the level required\
              \ for fully fault-tolerant QC. Quantum systems are inherently susceptible\
              \ to noise and decoherence, which can introduce errors into computations.\
              \ Developing more efficient and effective error correction methods is\
              \ essential for the future of quantum computing, and remains an active\
              \ area of research in 2024.\n**3. Hardware Limitations**\nThe physical\
              \ construction of quantum computers presents significant engineering\
              \ challenges. Quantum processors need to operate at extremely low temperatures,\
              \ close to absolute zero, and are highly sensitive to environmental\
              \ disturbances. Maintaining the delicate balance required for quantum\
              \ operations is difficult, and building robust, reliable quantum hardware\
              \ that can function outside of highly controlled laboratory environments\
              \ is still a major hurdle.\n**4. Security Concerns**\nThe potential\
              \ of QC to break current cryptographic systems is both a promise and\
              \ a threat. As quantum computers become more powerful, they could render\
              \ many of the encryption methods that secure today’s digital communications\
              \ obsolete. This has led to a race to develop quantum-resistant cryptography,\
              \ but widespread adoption is still years away. The looming threat of\
              \ quantum-enabled cyberattacks is a significant concern for governments\
              \ and industries worldwide.\n**5. High Costs and Accessibility**\nQuantum\
              \ computing technology remains expensive, and the expertise required\
              \ to work with quantum systems is still relatively rare. This limits\
              \ access to QC for many businesses and researchers, particularly smaller\
              \ organizations without the resources to invest in cutting-edge technology.\
              \ While quantum[cloud services] are helping to bridge this gap, the\
              \ costs and complexity of quantum computing remain barriers to widespread\
              \ adoption.\n## What Lies Ahead for QC\nAs we look to the future, the\
              \ road ahead for quantum computing is both challenging and full of potential.\
              \ Here are some key developments to watch for in the coming years:\n\
              **1. Quantum-Classical Hybrid Systems**\nOne of the most promising directions\
              \ for QC is the development of quantum-classical hybrid systems. These\
              \ systems combine the strengths of classical computing with the unique\
              \ capabilities of quantum processors, allowing for more efficient problem-solving.\
              \ In the near term, we are likely to see more hybrid approaches that\
              \ leverage quantum computing for specific tasks while relying on classical\
              \ computing for others.\n**2. Quantum Networking and the Quantum Internet**\n\
              Quantum networking, which involves connecting quantum computers over\
              \ long distances, is an emerging field with the potential to revolutionize\
              \ communication and data sharing. The concept of a quantum internet,\
              \ where quantum information is transmitted securely over vast distances,\
              \ is still in its early stages but could become a reality within the\
              \ next decade. This would open up new possibilities for secure communication,\
              \ distributed quantum computing, and more.\n**3. Wider Industry Adoption**\n\
              As quantum computing technology matures and becomes more accessible,\
              \ we can expect to see broader adoption across various industries. Sectors\
              \ such as finance, healthcare, energy, and logistics are likely to be\
              \ early adopters, using QC to optimize processes, develop new materials,\
              \ and solve complex logistical challenges. The potential applications\
              \ are vast, and as businesses begin to see tangible benefits from QC,\
              \ its adoption will accelerate.\n**4. Ongoing Research and Development**\n\
              The future of QC will be shaped by ongoing research and development\
              \ efforts. Governments, academic institutions, and private companies\
              \ are investing heavily in quantum research, with the goal of overcoming\
              \ current challenges and unlocking the full potential of this technology.\
              \ As breakthroughs continue to occur, we will move closer to the realization\
              \ of quantum computing’s promise.\nAs we look ahead, the continued advancement\
              \ of quantum computing will depend on the collaboration between researchers,\
              \ engineers, and businesses. The journey to fully functional QC is still\
              \ in its early stages, but the progress made in 2024 demonstrates that\
              \ the quantum revolution is well underway. By staying informed and engaged\
              \ with the[developments] in this field, businesses and individuals alike\
              \ can prepare for the transformative impact that quantum computing is\
              \ set to have on the world.\nRecent Posts\n[AI in the Workplace: What\

          answer: 'Quantum supremacy — sometimes called quantum advantage — is the
            milestone in quantum computing where a programmable quantum device performs
            a computational task that no classical computer can feasibly replicate.  In
            other words, it is the first experimental demonstration that a quantum
            processor can solve a problem faster (or with far fewer resources) than
            the best known classical algorithms on the most powerful supercomputers ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_supremacy)).  The
            concept was formalized as the point at which a universal quantum computer
            carries out a calculation that is provably beyond the reach of any classical
            machine, providing a clear benchmark for the emerging technology ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature23458)).


            The significance of quantum supremacy lies in its role as a proof‑of‑principle
            that quantum mechanics can be harnessed for practical computation.  Achieving
            it does not yet mean the quantum computer is useful for everyday problems,
            but it validates that quantum hardware can outperform classical processors
            on at least one well‑defined task.  The most publicised instance came
            in 2019 when Google’s 53‑qubit “Sycamore” processor sampled the output
            of a random quantum circuit in about 200 seconds—a task that would take
            the world’s fastest classical supercomputer thousands of years, sparking
            debate and prompting rival claims from IBM and other firms ([livescience.com](https://livescience.com/technology/computing/what-is-quantum-supremacy)).  Ongoing
            work aims to move from this benchmark toward algorithms that solve scientifically
            or commercially valuable problems.'
