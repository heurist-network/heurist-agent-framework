    response: "It looks like we've encountered a hurdle. Here's a breakdown of the\
      \ issue and a step-by-step plan to resolve it:\n\n**Error Analysis:**\n\n* **Error\
      \ Message:** `Failed to fetch smart followers: API error 401: 401: Unauthorized`\n\
      * **Error Code:** `401 Unauthorized`\n* **API:** Moni API (for Twitter analytics)\n\
      * **Requested Action:** Fetch smart followers for `@heurist_ai`\n\n**Resolution\
      \ Steps:**\n\n1. **Verify API Credentials:**\n\t* Ensure that the Moni API key/token\
      \ used for authentication is correct and up-to-date.\n\t* Check if the credentials\
      \ have been revoked or are near expiration.\n2. **Authentication Scope:**\n\t\
      * Confirm that the API credentials have the necessary permissions to access\
      \ Twitter analytics data, specifically for fetching smart followers.\n\t* If\
      \ using OAuth, verify that the correct scopes are authorized (e.g., `tweet.read`,\
      \ `users.read`, etc.).\n3. **Rate Limits:**\n\t* Although less likely for a\
      \ 401 error, check if your application has hit Twitter's rate limits for the\
      \ Moni API.\n\t* If so, consider implementing rate limiting handling in your\
      \ application or requesting a quota increase if necessary.\n4. **Moni API Documentation\
      \ Review:**\n\t* Visit the Moni API documentation to ensure you're using the\
      \ correct endpoint for fetching smart followers (e.g., `GET /users/{username}/smart_followers`).\n\
      \t* Double-check the required parameters and headers (e.g., `Authorization:\
      \ Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN`).\n5. **Test with API Tools (Optional):**\n\t* Utilize\
      \ tools like Postman, cURL, or the API's built-in testing console (if available)\
      \ to isolate the issue.\n\t* Attempt the request with the same credentials and\
      \ parameters to see if the problem persists.\n\n**Action Requested from You:**\n\
      \nTo proceed, please provide one of the following:\n\nA) **Confirm API Credentials:**\
      \ Verify your Moni API credentials are correct, and if so, provide a simple\
      \ \"Confirmed\" response.\n\nB) **Update API Credentials:** If your credentials\
      \ are outdated or incorrect, please update them and then respond with \"Updated\"\
      .\n\nC) **Provide Additional Context:** If you've already checked the above\
      \ steps or need further assistance, please share more details about your setup\
      \ or any recent changes made.\n\nOnce the authentication issue is resolved,\
      \ I'll be happy to assist in fetching the smart followers for `@heurist_ai`."

      \ by level for `@heurist_ai`\n* **API Endpoint:** Moni API (presumed, as per\
      \ your specialization)\n* **Response Status:** Error\n* **Error Details:**\n\
      \t+ **Error Code:** 401\n\t+ **Error Message:** Unauthorized\n\t+ **Specific\
      \ Error:** Failed to fetch smart followers distribution\n\n**Analysis and Recommended\
      \ Actions:**\n\n1. **Authentication Issue:**\n\t* The **401 Unauthorized** error\
      \ indicates that the request was not authenticated correctly. This could be\
      \ due to:\n\t\t- **Invalid API Key:** The provided API key might be incorrect,\
      \ expired, or not properly formatted.\n\t\t- **Insufficient Permissions:** The\
      \ authenticated account may not have the necessary permissions to access the\
      \ smart followers distribution data for `@heurist_ai`.\n\t\t- **Authentication\
      \ Method:** The method used for authentication (e.g., OAuth, Bearer Token) might\
      \ not be correctly implemented.\n\n2. **Troubleshooting Steps:**\n\t* **Verify\
      \ API Key:**\n\t\t- Double-check that the API key used is correct and up-to-date.\n\
      \t\t- Ensure the key is properly formatted in the request header (if applicable).\n\
      \t* **Check Permissions:**\n\t\t- Confirm with Moni API support that your account\
      \ has access to smart followers data.\n\t\t- Verify if there are specific permissions\
      \ required for `@heurist_ai` that are not currently granted.\n\t* **Review Authentication\
      \ Method:**\n\t\t- Consult Moni API documentation to ensure the authentication\
      \ method used is correct and properly implemented.\n\t\t- If using OAuth, verify\
      \ that all steps, including redirects and token exchanges, are correctly handled.\n\
      \n3. **Next Steps:**\n\t* Once the authentication issue is resolved, **retry\
      \ the original request** to fetch the smart followers distribution by level\
      \ for `@heurist_ai`.\n\t* If issues persist after troubleshooting, **contact\
      \ Moni API Support** for further assistance, providing them with the error details\
      \ and steps taken to troubleshoot.\n\n**Retry Request (Once Authentication is\

    query: Get the categories of smart followers for @heurist_ai
  output:
    response: "It looks like the API request didn't quite go as planned. Let's break\
      \ down the error message and outline the next steps:\n\n**Error Message Decoded:**\n\
      \n* **`error`**: Indicates that an error occurred.\n* **`Failed to fetch smart\
      \ followers categories`**: Specifies the action that failed (fetching smart\
      \ follower categories for `@heurist_ai`).\n* **`API error 401`**: This is the\
      \ key part:\n\t+ **`401`**: This is an HTTP status code for \"Unauthorized\"\
      . It means the request was invalid due to a lack of authentication or invalid\
      \ authentication credentials.\n\t+ **`Unauthorized`**: Further emphasizes that\
      \ the issue is with the authorization to access the requested data.\n\n**Next\
      \ Steps to Resolve the Issue:**\n\n1. **Verify API Credentials**:\n\t* Double-check\
      \ that your Moni API credentials (e.g., API key, access token, username/password\
      \ if applicable) are correct and up-to-date.\n\t* Ensure that these credentials\
      \ have the necessary permissions to access the smart followers' category data.\n\
      \n2. **Authenticate Properly**:\n\t* Review the Moni API documentation to ensure\
      \ you're using the correct authentication method (e.g., Bearer Token, Basic\
      \ Auth).\n\t* If using a token, verify it hasn't expired. Tokens often have\
      \ a limited lifespan and may need to be refreshed.\n\n3. **Adjust the Request\
      \ (If Necessary)**:\n\t* If the API documentation suggests specific headers,\
      \ parameters, or formatting for requests that you haven't included, adjust your\
      \ request accordingly.\n\n4. **Retry the Request**:\n\t* Once you've addressed\
      \ the potential issues with your credentials or request format, retry fetching\
      \ the categories of smart followers for `@heurist_ai`.\n\n5. **Contact Support\
      \ (If Issues Persist)**:\n\t* If after verifying and adjusting your approach\
      \ you still receive the `401 Unauthorized` error, consider reaching out to Moni\
      \ API support for further assistance. They can provide more detailed insights\
      \ into the issue.\n\n**Example of How to Retry (Assuming Command-Line `curl`\
      \ for Simplicity):**\n\n```bash\n# Assuming you're using a Bearer Token for\
      \ authentication\n# Replace 'YOUR_UPDATED_BEARER_TOKEN' and 'OTHER_PARAMETERS_IF_NEEDED'\n\
      curl -X GET \\\n  'https://api.moni.com/v1/smart-followers/categories?handle=heurist_ai&OTHER_PARAMETERS_IF_NEEDED'\
      \ \\\n  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_UPDATED_BEARER_TOKEN' \\\n  -H 'Content-Type:\
      \ application/json'\n```\n\nPlease update your API credentials or request as\
      \ necessary, and then I'll be happy to guide you through analyzing the data\
      \ once you've successfully fetched it."
