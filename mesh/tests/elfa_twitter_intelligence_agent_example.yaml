          \nWith MCP, you'll be able to guide your agents by assigning tasks to individual\
          \ agents who will be able to work cohesively as a swarm. For example, one\
          \ agent could track news websites within web3, another could highlight particular\
          \ terms that are trending within these sites, a third could track X accounts\
          \ that use these terms in their bio, while a fourth could track age of X\
          \ account to be <1 week old. As a swarm, this would give you an edge in\
          \ finding projects before the masses. Just one such example. But the examples\

            Model Context Protocol solves the connectivity problem between AI agents
            and data sources.


            But these specialized AI agents need solutions to:

            Model Context Protocol solves the connectivity problem between AI agents
            and data sources.


            But these specialized AI agents need solutions to:
