          text: 'NYSE Prepares Tokenized Securities Platform – Beneficiary Stocks
            & Tokens - ICE previously launched Bakkt, an institutional Bitcoin platform,
            which ultimately failed. Since then, however, ICE has continued to pursue
            crypto/blockchain-related new businesses, including a $2bn investment
            in the Polymarket prediction market and initiatives around RWA tokenization
            platforms. - The NYSE stated that the platform will have the “capability
            to support multiple blockchains for settlement and custody,” but it has
            not yet disclosed which blockchains will be supported. - Potential candidates
            include Ethereum, Solana, or a permissioned private blockchain. The Canton
            Network, which has recently partnered with DTCC and Nasdaq, could also
            be a contender. - Beneficiary stocks: ICE (parent company of the NYSE),
            Robinhood, Coinbase (brokerages), Circle (stablecoin issuer), BNY Mellon,
            Citi (banking partners). - Beneficiary tokens: Chainlink (oracle), Ethereum,
            Solana, Canton (mainnet), assuming adoption. - In the crypto space, Hyperliquid
            is currently a leading player in RWA tokenization trading, but increased
            participation by U.S. institutions could be negative for it. That said,
            due to demand related to KYC/AML circumvention, airdrops, arbitrage, and
            tax avoidance, crypto-native RWA DEXs—including Hyperliquid—are unlikely
            to disappear. - Since crypto fundamentals and token prices often move
            independently, this should be taken as reference only. - On-chain tokenization
            of real-world assets will accelerate the demise of altcoins. Going forward,
            who will still trade altcoins?'

          text: 'Lecimy z podsumowaniem najważniejszych newsów z rynku krypto (i nie
            tylko!) 👇 1️⃣ Mocna korekta na Bitcoinie i rekordy na metalach • Bitcoin
            w nocy zanurkował o ponad 3.5% do poziomu $92,000, co wywołało likwidacje
            o łącznej wartości $872.9 mln - ból poczuły głównie byki, bo aż $787 mln
            to pozycje długie. • Kapitał ucieka w bezpieczne przystanie - złoto wyznaczyło
            nowe ATH na poziomie $4,690, a srebro przebiło $94, zostawiając lukę CME
            na poziomie $90. 2️⃣ ETFy wciąż wciągają kapitał - instytucje kupują dołek
            • Mimo zmienności, zeszły tydzień to potężne zakupy gigantów: Bitcoin
            +$1.42 mld, Ethereum +$489.04 mln, a Solana +$46.88 mln. • XRP (+$56.83
            mln) i Litecoin (+$2 mln) również na plusie - grubasy ewidentnie wykorzystały
            spadki do akumulacji, patrząc na fundusze ETF na całym świecie to był
            to najlepszy tydzień od października 2025r (łącznie 2.17 miliarda dolarów
            wpływów) 3️⃣ Vitalik: Skomplikowane Ethereum to martwe Ethereum • Twórca
            ETH opublikował manifest, ostrzegając przed syndromem „arcykapłanów” -
            kod jest tak zawiły, że rozumie go garstka ludzi, co zagraża decentralizacji.
            • Plan naprawczy to „odśmiecanie”: mniej kodu, unikanie egzotycznej matematyki
            i przenoszenie funkcji do warstwy smart kontraktów, aby sieć mogła przetrwać
            100 lat. 4️⃣ Fundamenty Ethereum silne jak nigdy • Średnia dzienna liczba
            transakcji wbiła nowe ATH (2.5 mln), co jest wynikiem prawie 2x lepszym
            niż rok temu. • Mimo rekordowego ruchu, sieć pozostaje tania - średnia
            opłata spadła do historycznego minimum $0.01. Użyteczność rośnie, koszty
            maleją 👌 5️⃣ Kazachstan bierze krypto za twarz • Prezydent podpisał ustawy
            oddające rynek pod ścisłą kontrolę państwa - teraz to Bank Centralny zdecyduje,
            czym można legalnie handlować. • Rządy przestają ignorować cyfrowe aktywa
            i niektórzy niestety zaczynają zaciskać pętlę regulacyjną. 6️⃣ Eskalacja
            konfliktu o Grenlandię - Europa wyciąga „finansową atomówkę” • Wojna handlowa
            wisi na włosku - UE szykuje cła odwetowe na 93 mld euro, ale Deutsche
            Bank wskazuje na prawdziwego asa w rękawie: Europa trzyma aż $8 bln w
            amerykańskich aktywach (obligacje i akcje). • To gigantyczna dźwignia
            na Trumpa, ewentualna wyprzedaż tych aktywów zachwiałaby Wall Street,
            choć bank ostrzega, że otwarta wojna handlowa boleśnie uderzy w całe globalne
            rynki. • Sytuacja jest też napięta militarnie - Niemcy po zaledwie 44
            godzinach wycofali żołnierzy z misji NATO, a Europa formuje zjednoczony
            front przeciwko „szantażowi” USA - sytuacje śledzimy na bieżąco na telegramie,
            link w komentarzu pod tym wpisem. 7️⃣ Wybory w Japonii a kurs Bitcoina
            • Premier Japonii planuje rozwiązać parlament i zarządzić wybory na 8
            lutego. • Zmiany w Tokio mogą wpłynąć na stopy procentowe Banku Japonii
            - każde zachwianie japońskiej „drukarki” (Yen carry trade) lubi wywoływać
            wstrząsy na globalnych rynkach i krypto. 8️⃣ Steak ’n Shake kupuje Bitcoina
            za $10 mln • Popularna sieć burgerowni ujawniła zakup BTC za $10 mln i
            chwali się wzrostem sprzedaży o 15% w ostatnim kwartale. • Firma od maja
            akceptuje płatności w krypto - adopcja smakuje coraz lepiej;p‌ 9️⃣ FED
            dolewa paliwa - $55.3 mld płynności • Rezerwa Federalna planuje wpompować
            w system ponad $55 mld do 12 lutego poprzez skup rezerw i reinwestycje
            w obligacje. • Może jeszcze nie drukujemy na pełną skalę, ale byki z pewnością
            nie pogardzą takim prezentem.‌ Jeżeli dotarłeś do końca, to strzel ♥️i
            wpadaj grupy PRO po więcej mięcha. (link dla chętnych zostawiam w komentarzu)

          text: 'Neobanks are on track to become a $10B+ on-chain category by the
            end of 2026. That’s before most users even realize they’re using them.
            Three early projects sit right at the centre of that shift → @telcoin
            ( $TEL ) → @Thorwallet ( $TITN ) → @AviciMoney ( $AVICI ) One of these
            could be the next 10x👇 🔵Telcoin ( $TEL ): Mobile-First Digital Banking
            + Remittances ✦ Tech Used → Multi-Chain Stablecoins + Telecom Integration
            • Built on Polygon and Ethereum for low-cost, efficient transactions.
            • Integrates with mobile networks for seamless on-chain remittances and
            payments. ✦ Regulatory Framework → U.S. Licensed Digital Asset Bank •
            Operates under Nebraska state charter as Telcoin Digital Asset Bank. •
            Compliant with FinCEN; focuses on regulated stablecoin issuance like eUSD.
            ✦ Products & Services → eUSD + Telcoin Wallet + Remittances • eUSD → yield-bearing
            stablecoin backed by U.S. Treasuries, live on Ethereum and Polygon since
            December 2025. • Telcoin Wallet → self-custodial app for payments, swaps,
            and banking services. • Remittances → instant, low-fee transfers via telecom
            partnerships in 171 countries. Telcoin bridges telecom and blockchain
            to deliver global finance directly to mobile phones. It powers "Digital
            Cash" with multi-currency stablecoins, enabling on-chain remittances and
            regulated banking without traditional banks. The V5 wallet integrates
            personal and business accounts, with expansions targeting emerging markets
            for real-world use. With a $10M initial eUSD issuance and plans for full
            banking rollout in early 2026, Telcoin is scaling mobile-first neobanking.
            My take: Telcoin is the telecom powerhouse in on-chain neobanks blending
            mobile money with stablecoins for global remittances and banking. 🟢THORWallet
            ( $TITN ): Multi-Chain DeFi Wallet + Fiat On-Ramps ✦ Tech Used → Cross-Chain
            Swaps + Self-Custodial Infra • Powered by THORChain for native cross-chain
            swaps without bridges. • Supports Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana, BNB, TRON,
            Stellar, and more with multisig security. ✦ Regulatory Framework → Swiss
            Compliance + Licensed Features • Operates as a Swiss neobank with IBAN
            accounts and Mastercard integration. • KYC/AML compliant for fiat services;
            non-custodial for crypto. ✦ Products & Services → THORWallet App + Crypto
            Card + IBAN • THORWallet App → staking, swapping, and yield farming across
            chains. • Crypto Card → Mastercard for spending crypto at fiat terminals
            globally in 100+ countries. • IBAN Accounts → digital Swiss bank accounts
            for fiat-crypto bridging. THORWallet is the ultimate self-custodial wallet
            merging DeFi with real-world spending. It enables seamless swaps, staking,
            and Web3 access, while the crypto card and IBAN allow instant fiat conversions.
            With $1.7B in swaps processed YTD and an upcoming airdrop, it''s a mobile-first
            superapp bringing DeFi to everyday finance. My take: THORWallet is the
            versatile DeFi hub for on-chain neobanks all-in-one wallet with fiat rails
            and cross-chain efficiency. ⚪️Avici ( $AVICI ): On-Chain Neobank + Credit
            Innovation ✦ Tech Used → Solana Blockchain + Tokenized Credit • High-speed
            Solana for low-fee transactions and neobank features. • Tokenizes assets
            and enables uncollateralized loans with privacy-focused transactions.
            ✦ Regulatory Framework → Permissioned + Compliance-Focused • Named virtual
            accounts with KYC for fiat-stablecoin conversions (IBAN in EU, ACH/wires
            in US). • Operates under global regs for neobank services; no team tokens
            for transparency. ✦ Products & Services → Virtual Accounts + Stablecoins
            + Loans • Virtual Accounts → seamless fiat-to-crypto with self-custody,
            powered by MoonPay, supporting SEPA Instant, ACH, and direct deposits.
            • Stablecoins → privacy-focused deposits, withdrawals, and spending. •
            Uncollateralized Loans → decentralized credit for institutions and users,
            plus on-chain credit scoring and cards. Avici is building an internet-native
            neobank that keeps users in control of their funds. It bridges fiat and
            crypto without intermediaries, offering virtual accounts as real alternatives
            to traditional banks, plus credit cards and RWA tokenization. With $3.5M
            raised in 2025 and recent virtual account launches, it''s positioned for
            DeFi banking growth. The "no team tokens" model builds community trust.
            My take: Avici is the innovative neobank pioneer in on-chain protocols
            on-chain credit and fiat-crypto bridging on Solana. Conclusion: The Neobank
            Edge On-chain neobanks are more than a trend they’re how crypto reinvents
            banking for the digital era. • Telcoin → remittances + mobile banking,
            telecom-driven. • THORWallet → multi-chain wallet + spending, DeFi-fiat
            hybrid. • Avici → neobank + credit, Solana-native innovation. Final Rankings
            → Tech Used: $TITN > $AVICI > $TEL THORWallet leads in cross-chain swaps,
            Avici excels in Solana speed/tokenization, Telcoin focuses on telecom
            integration. Regulatory Framework: $TEL > $TITN > $AVICI Telcoin has U.S.
            banking charter strength. THORWallet uses Swiss compliance. Avici emphasizes
            permissioned KYC. Products & Services: $AVICI > $TEL > $TITN Avici delivers
            cutting-edge accounts and loans. Telcoin bridges remittances and wallets.
            THORWallet serves DeFi spending needs. 🔚My Takeaway: If you want telecom-powered
            global access → Telcoin. If you want versatile DeFi tools + fiat spending
            → THORWallet. If you want innovative on-chain banking + credit → Avici.

          text: 'NYSE Prepares Tokenized Securities Platform – Beneficiary Stocks
            & Tokens - ICE previously launched Bakkt, an institutional Bitcoin platform,
            which ultimately failed. Since then, however, ICE has continued to pursue
            crypto/blockchain-related new businesses, including a $2bn investment
            in the Polymarket prediction market and initiatives around RWA tokenization
            platforms. - The NYSE stated that the platform will have the “capability
            to support multiple blockchains for settlement and custody,” but it has
            not yet disclosed which blockchains will be supported. - Potential candidates
            include Ethereum, Solana, or a permissioned private blockchain. The Canton
            Network, which has recently partnered with DTCC and Nasdaq, could also
            be a contender. - Beneficiary stocks: ICE (parent company of the NYSE),
            Robinhood, Coinbase (brokerages), Circle (stablecoin issuer), BNY Mellon,
            Citi (banking partners). - Beneficiary tokens: Chainlink (oracle), Ethereum,
            Solana, Canton (mainnet), assuming adoption. - In the crypto space, Hyperliquid
            is currently a leading player in RWA tokenization trading, but increased
            participation by U.S. institutions could be negative for it. That said,
            due to demand related to KYC/AML circumvention, airdrops, arbitrage, and
            tax avoidance, crypto-native RWA DEXs—including Hyperliquid—are unlikely
            to disappear. - Since crypto fundamentals and token prices often move
            independently, this should be taken as reference only. - On-chain tokenization
            of real-world assets will accelerate the demise of altcoins. Going forward,
            who will still trade altcoins?'

            text: $HEU AI is purpose built for crypto and blockchain from the trenches
              to on-chain agents. Few models out there can even touch the depth of
              analysis needed in this space. With recent data showing over 29 million
              total crypto tokens across all chains (and that number exploding thanks
              to easy launches on Solana/Base/etc.), most AI just chokes on the noise.
              But ask @heurist_ai about any of them, deep dives, on chain insights,
              tokenomics breakdowns, agent-powered research, you name it.

            text: $HEU AI is purpose built for crypto and blockchain from the trenches
              to on-chain agents. Few models out there can even touch the depth of
              analysis needed in this space. With recent data showing over 29 million
              total crypto tokens across all chains (and that number exploding thanks
              to easy launches on Solana/Base/etc.), most AI just chokes on the noise.
              But ask @heurist_ai about any of them, deep dives, on chain insights,
              tokenomics breakdowns, agent-powered research, you name it.
