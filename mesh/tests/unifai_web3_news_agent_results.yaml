              on April 16, reiterating that the OM crash didn‚Äôt involve token sales

              in India by bringing blockchain access to over 450 million Reliance
              Jio users, it remains focused on balancing speed, scalability and affordability,
              without compromising on decentralization.Polygon is working with Jio,
              a telecom giant owned by India‚Äôs richest man, Mukesh Ambani, to find
              ways to infuse blockchain technology into its existing services. The
              duo is currently adding blockchain-based capabilities to the JioSphere
              web browser, which would have been expensive, cumbersome and time-consuming
              via traditional methods.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre building at an insane pace, onboarding
              massive partners, and pushing blockchain into the mainstream, but with

              the core values of blockchain intact: security, transparency and decentralization.At
              the same time, Nailwal revealed that Polygon is investing heavily in
              zero-knowledge technology to make scaling more seamless across the ecosystem.
              ‚ÄúThe goal is to give developers and users the best of both worlds: faster,
              cheaper transactions without compromising trust or decentralization,‚Äù
              he added.As a result of delivering the combination of low fees, fast
              transactions and decentralized security, Polygon is already powering
              some of the most active use cases in Web3, from stablecoin payments
              on Polygon PoS to real-world tokenization with major institutions: ‚ÄúThe
              key challenge is making blockchain as seamless and accessible as Web2

              ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be working closely with Jio to develop use cases that truly resonate
              with their users, and gradually onboard them onto the chain based on
              these real-world applications,‚Äù he added.Nailwal said that developers
              never have to compromise on the fundamentals, as Polygon‚Äôs infrastructure
              can scale without sacrificing what makes blockchain powerful in the
              first place:‚ÄúWhat excites me most is that we''re moving beyond technical
              discussions about blockchain to solving real problems for real people.

              on trusted sources will eventually result in an uptick of blockchain-based

              may be ‚Äústaked back‚Äù to Babylon Community members are speculating on
              who was behind the unstaking. One X user suspected that the Bitcoin
              may belong to the Chinese government, while another said the move may
              simply be a rotation, risk-off, or a trader getting liquid.While it‚Äôs
              unclear who‚Äôs behind the four addresses cited by Lookonchain, the fund
              movements could be related to a transition initiated by the decentralized
              finance (DeFi) protocol Lombard Finance. At the time of the unstaking,
              Babylon Labs retweeted an announcement from Lombard, saying it was unstaking
              Bitcoin as part of a transition to a new set of finality providers.
              Lombard Finance said it timed the unstaking with the end of Babylon‚Äôs
              phase 1 cap 1 on April 24 so users would not miss out on rewards. The
              protocol said it would stake the assets back. ‚ÄúAll of this BTC will
              be staked back into Babylon as soon as the unbonding is complete,‚Äù Lombard
              Finance wrote. Cointelegraph reached out to Babylon Labs for comments

              follows BABY airdropThe massive unstaking event follows a Babylon airdrop
              for early adopters. On April 3, Babylon announced the details of its
              early adopters airdrop program. The airdrop was allocated for its Phase
              1 stakers, non-fungible token (NFT) holders and developers. The protocol
              allocated 600 million BABY tokens for the airdrop event. Following the
              airdrop, $21 million in BTC was unstaked from the protocol. Bitlayer
              co-founder Kevin He previously told Cointelegraph that this was a common
              short-term market behavior representing early redemption. Babylon is
              one of the largest Bitcoin DeFi players in the space, with a TVL reaching
              over $6 billion in December. Babylon co-founder Fisher Yu previously
              told Cointelegraph that the platform allows staking to be a native use

              ongoing recovery, Solana price has to first hold above the 50-day simple
              moving average (SMA), currently at $130, and then overcome the resistance
              between $160 and $180, where the 100-day and 200-day SMAs are.As Contelegraph

            summary: 'As Polygon lays the groundwork for mainstream Web3 adoption
              in India by bringing blockchain access to over 450 million Reliance
              Jio users, it remains focused on balancing speed, scalability and affordability,
              without compromising on decentralization.Polygon is working with Jio,
              a telecom giant owned by India‚Äôs richest man, Mukesh Ambani, to find
              ways to infuse blockchain technology into its existing services. The
              duo is currently adding blockchain-based capabilities to the JioSphere
              web browser, which would have been expensive, cumbersome and time-consuming
              via traditional methods.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre building at an insane pace, onboarding
              massive partners, and pushing blockchain into the mainstream, but with
              that growth comes the responsibility to make sure we‚Äôre doing it the
              right way,‚Äù Polygon‚Äôs co-founder, Sandeep Nailwal, said while discussing
              Polygon‚Äôs India-focused initiatives with Cointelegraph. Preserving decentralization
              while ensuring system scalability‚ÄúScalability and decentralization don‚Äôt
              have to be either-or, and that‚Äôs exactly the balance we‚Äôre focused on
              at Polygon,‚Äù Nailwal said as he underscored the importance of keeping
              the core values of blockchain intact: security, transparency and decentralization.At
              the same time, Nailwal revealed that Polygon is investing heavily in
              zero-knowledge technology to make scaling more seamless across the ecosystem.
              ‚ÄúThe goal is to give developers and users the best of both worlds: faster,
              cheaper transactions without compromising trust or decentralization,‚Äù
              he added.As a result of delivering the combination of low fees, fast
              transactions and decentralized security, Polygon is already powering
              some of the most active use cases in Web3, from stablecoin payments
              on Polygon PoS to real-world tokenization with major institutions: ‚ÄúThe
              key challenge is making blockchain as seamless and accessible as Web2
              without compromising what makes it special. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre all-in
              on ZK technology and Agglayer, which let us scale while keeping the
              ecosystem trustless and interoperable.‚ÄùBringing blockchain tech to millions
              of usersAccording to Nailwal, a one-size-fits-all approach does not
              work when onboarding 450 million users from India‚Äôs diverse population.
              ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be working closely with Jio to develop use cases that truly resonate
              with their users, and gradually onboard them onto the chain based on
              these real-world applications,‚Äù he added.Nailwal said that developers
              never have to compromise on the fundamentals, as Polygon‚Äôs infrastructure
              can scale without sacrificing what makes blockchain powerful in the
              first place:‚ÄúWhat excites me most is that we''re moving beyond technical
              discussions about blockchain to solving real problems for real people.
              These are the use cases that will drive the next wave of adoption.‚Äù‚ÄúAt
              the end of the day, it‚Äôs about more than just technology. We‚Äôre here
              to create a decentralized future that billions of people can actually
              use. And while that‚Äôs a massive challenge, it‚Äôs also what excites me

              on trusted sources will eventually result in an uptick of blockchain-based
              verification tools.Additionally, Nailwal highlighted the growing relevance

              from its platform, reducing the protocol‚Äôs total value locked by 32%.
              On April 17, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain flagged several addresses
              that had unstaked a total of 14,929 Bitcoin (BTC) from the staking platform.
              The security firm flagged four addresses that had unstaked 299 BTC,
              499 BTC, 1,000 BTC and 13,129 BTC. One address held a majority of the
              unstaked assets worth $1.1 billion. With BTC prices hovering at around
              $84,400, the total unstaked BTC was worth about $1.26 billion.The unstaking
              event saw Babylon‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) drop by 32%. According
              to data tracker DefiLlama, Babylon‚Äôs TVL declined from $3.97 billion

              may be ‚Äústaked back‚Äù to Babylon Community members are speculating on
              who was behind the unstaking. One X user suspected that the Bitcoin
              may belong to the Chinese government, while another said the move may
              simply be a rotation, risk-off, or a trader getting liquid.While it‚Äôs
              unclear who‚Äôs behind the four addresses cited by Lookonchain, the fund
              movements could be related to a transition initiated by the decentralized
              finance (DeFi) protocol Lombard Finance. At the time of the unstaking,
              Babylon Labs retweeted an announcement from Lombard, saying it was unstaking
              Bitcoin as part of a transition to a new set of finality providers.
              Lombard Finance said it timed the unstaking with the end of Babylon‚Äôs
              phase 1 cap 1 on April 24 so users would not miss out on rewards. The
              protocol said it would stake the assets back. ‚ÄúAll of this BTC will
              be staked back into Babylon as soon as the unbonding is complete,‚Äù Lombard

              allocated 600 million BABY tokens for the airdrop event. Following the
              airdrop, $21 million in BTC was unstaked from the protocol. Bitlayer
              co-founder Kevin He previously told Cointelegraph that this was a common
              short-term market behavior representing early redemption. Babylon is
              one of the largest Bitcoin DeFi players in the space, with a TVL reaching

              in India by bringing blockchain access to over 450 million Reliance
              Jio users, it remains focused on balancing speed, scalability and affordability,
              without compromising on decentralization.Polygon is working with Jio,
              a telecom giant owned by India‚Äôs richest man, Mukesh Ambani, to find
              ways to infuse blockchain technology into its existing services. The

              have to be either-or, and that‚Äôs exactly the balance we‚Äôre focused on

              the core values of blockchain intact: security, transparency and decentralization.At
              the same time, Nailwal revealed that Polygon is investing heavily in
              zero-knowledge technology to make scaling more seamless across the ecosystem.
              ‚ÄúThe goal is to give developers and users the best of both worlds: faster,

              transactions and decentralized security, Polygon is already powering
              some of the most active use cases in Web3, from stablecoin payments
              on Polygon PoS to real-world tokenization with major institutions: ‚ÄúThe
              key challenge is making blockchain as seamless and accessible as Web2

            summary: 'Bitcoin staking protocol Babylon saw $1.26 billion in BTC unstaked
              from its platform, reducing the protocol‚Äôs total value locked by 32%.
              On April 17, blockchain analytics firm Lookonchain flagged several addresses
              that had unstaked a total of 14,929 Bitcoin (BTC) from the staking platform.
              The security firm flagged four addresses that had unstaked 299 BTC,
              499 BTC, 1,000 BTC and 13,129 BTC. One address held a majority of the
              unstaked assets worth $1.1 billion. With BTC prices hovering at around
              $84,400, the total unstaked BTC was worth about $1.26 billion.The unstaking
              event saw Babylon‚Äôs total value locked (TVL) drop by 32%. According
              to data tracker DefiLlama, Babylon‚Äôs TVL declined from $3.97 billion
              to $2.68 billion after the unstaking.Source: LookonchainUnstaked Bitcoin
              may be ‚Äústaked back‚Äù to Babylon Community members are speculating on
              who was behind the unstaking. One X user suspected that the Bitcoin
              may belong to the Chinese government, while another said the move may
              simply be a rotation, risk-off, or a trader getting liquid.While it‚Äôs
              unclear who‚Äôs behind the four addresses cited by Lookonchain, the fund
              movements could be related to a transition initiated by the decentralized
              finance (DeFi) protocol Lombard Finance. At the time of the unstaking,
              Babylon Labs retweeted an announcement from Lombard, saying it was unstaking
              Bitcoin as part of a transition to a new set of finality providers.
              Lombard Finance said it timed the unstaking with the end of Babylon‚Äôs
              phase 1 cap 1 on April 24 so users would not miss out on rewards. The
              protocol said it would stake the assets back. ‚ÄúAll of this BTC will
              be staked back into Babylon as soon as the unbonding is complete,‚Äù Lombard
              Finance wrote. Cointelegraph reached out to Babylon Labs for comments

              follows BABY airdropThe massive unstaking event follows a Babylon airdrop
              for early adopters. On April 3, Babylon announced the details of its
              early adopters airdrop program. The airdrop was allocated for its Phase
              1 stakers, non-fungible token (NFT) holders and developers. The protocol
              allocated 600 million BABY tokens for the airdrop event. Following the
              airdrop, $21 million in BTC was unstaked from the protocol. Bitlayer
              co-founder Kevin He previously told Cointelegraph that this was a common
              short-term market behavior representing early redemption. Babylon is
              one of the largest Bitcoin DeFi players in the space, with a TVL reaching
              over $6 billion in December. Babylon co-founder Fisher Yu previously
              told Cointelegraph that the platform allows staking to be a native use
              case for Bitcoin, eliminating the need to trust another party while
              staking. Magazine: Your AI ‚Äòdigital twin‚Äô can take meetings and comfort

              in India by bringing blockchain access to over 450 million Reliance
              Jio users, it remains focused on balancing speed, scalability and affordability,
              without compromising on decentralization.Polygon is working with Jio,
              a telecom giant owned by India‚Äôs richest man, Mukesh Ambani, to find
              ways to infuse blockchain technology into its existing services. The
              duo is currently adding blockchain-based capabilities to the JioSphere

              have to be either-or, and that‚Äôs exactly the balance we‚Äôre focused on
              at Polygon,‚Äù Nailwal said as he underscored the importance of keeping
              the core values of blockchain intact: security, transparency and decentralization.At
              the same time, Nailwal revealed that Polygon is investing heavily in
              zero-knowledge technology to make scaling more seamless across the ecosystem.
              ‚ÄúThe goal is to give developers and users the best of both worlds: faster,

              some of the most active use cases in Web3, from stablecoin payments
              on Polygon PoS to real-world tokenization with major institutions: ‚ÄúThe

              ‚ÄúWe‚Äôll be working closely with Jio to develop use cases that truly resonate
              with their users, and gradually onboard them onto the chain based on
              these real-world applications,‚Äù he added.Nailwal said that developers
              never have to compromise on the fundamentals, as Polygon‚Äôs infrastructure
              can scale without sacrificing what makes blockchain powerful in the
              first place:‚ÄúWhat excites me most is that we''re moving beyond technical
              discussions about blockchain to solving real problems for real people.

              may be ‚Äústaked back‚Äù to Babylon Community members are speculating on
              who was behind the unstaking. One X user suspected that the Bitcoin
              may belong to the Chinese government, while another said the move may
              simply be a rotation, risk-off, or a trader getting liquid.While it‚Äôs
              unclear who‚Äôs behind the four addresses cited by Lookonchain, the fund
              movements could be related to a transition initiated by the decentralized
              finance (DeFi) protocol Lombard Finance. At the time of the unstaking,
              Babylon Labs retweeted an announcement from Lombard, saying it was unstaking
              Bitcoin as part of a transition to a new set of finality providers.
              Lombard Finance said it timed the unstaking with the end of Babylon‚Äôs
              phase 1 cap 1 on April 24 so users would not miss out on rewards. The
              protocol said it would stake the assets back. ‚ÄúAll of this BTC will
