      query: What has Donald Trump posted recently on Truth Social?
    output:
      response: 'Donald Trump has recently posted about a variety of topics on Truth
        Social. Here''s a summary of his posts:


        **Legal Actions & Media:**

        *   He announced a $15 billion defamation and libel lawsuit against The New
        York Times, accusing them of lying about him, his family, and the America
        First Movement. He also referenced successful litigation against ABC/Disney
        and CBS/Paramount for similar reasons.


        **Crime & Public Safety:**

        *   He claimed that crime is down in Memphis, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Washington
        D.C. due to federal intervention under his direction. He stated that in Washington
        D.C., crime has become "virtually NO CRIME" in a few weeks due to federal
        involvement.

        *   He signed a Presidential Memorandum to establish the Memphis Safe Task
        Force at the request of Governor Bill Lee of Tennessee.

        *   He stated that he will not allow Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser to
        stop cooperation with ICE in removing illegal aliens, threatening a National
        Emergency and federalization if necessary to prevent crime from returning.

        *   He reported on a brutal murder in Dallas, Texas, where an illegal alien
        from Cuba allegedly beheaded a man. He vowed to be tough on illegal immigrant
        criminals and stated that the individual will be prosecuted for first-degree
        murder.

        *   He announced a second kinetic strike by U.S. Military Forces against drug
        trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists from Venezuela in international waters,
        resulting in 3 deaths. He warned that anyone transporting drugs that can kill
        Americans will be hunted.


        **Economy & Trade:**

        *   He advocated for foreign companies making complex products to bring their
        experts to the U.S. to teach American workers, arguing this incentivizes investment
        and helps the U.S. relearn manufacturing skills.

        *   He suggested that companies should report on a six-month basis instead
        of quarterly to save money and allow managers to focus on running their companies.

        *   He indicated that a trade meeting in Europe between the U.S. and China
        went "VERY WELL" and a deal was reached on a "certain" company that young
        people wanted to save. He plans to speak with President Xi on Friday.

        *   He urged for immediate and significant interest rate cuts to boost housing.


        **Politics & Government:**

        *   He called on Congressional Republicans to stick together and vote "YES"
        on a short-term "CLEAN" extension of Government Funding to prevent a shutdown.

        *   He criticized New York Governor Kathy Hochul for endorsing "Liddle'' Communist,"
        Zohran Mamdani, for Mayor of New York, calling it a "shocking development."


        **Social & Cultural Commentary:**

        *   He expressed strong disapproval of the new NFL Kickoff Rule, calling it
        "ridiculous," "dangerous," and "sissy" football, and hoped college football
        rules would remain unchanged.

        *   He honored Retired U.S. Army Sergeant Michael Verardo, a wounded veteran,
        and his wife Sarah, for their service and advocacy.

        *   He promoted his son Eric''s new book, "UNDER SIEGE," which immediately
        became a #1 bestseller on Amazon.

        *   He wrote the foreword for George "Tyrus" Murdoch''s new book, "WHAT IT
        IS, AMERICA," praising Tyrus''s insights and humor.


        **International Affairs:**

        *   He reacted to reports that Hamas moved hostages above ground to use them
        as human shields, calling it a "human atrocity" and demanding the release
        of all hostages.


        **General Sentiments:**

        *   He stated, "I would rather go to ribbon cuttings than to groundbreakings!"'

        - content: RT @realDonaldTrumpThe only reason crime is somewhat down in Memphis
            is because the FBI, and others in the Federal Government, at my direction,
            have been working there for 5 months - on the absolutely terrible Crime
            numbers. Likewise, in Chicago and Los Angeles! But the real work by us
            has barely begun. That happens after we make the official announcement
            that WE’RE COMING, and when we do that, as we did in now VERY SAFE WASHINGTON,
            D.C., the no crime “miracle” begins. ONLY I CAN SAVE THEM!!! Thank you
            for your attention to this matter. President DJT

        - content: RT @realDonaldTrumpWhen Foreign Companies who are building extremely
            complex products, machines, and various other “things,” come into the
            United States with massive Investments, I want them to bring their people
            of expertise for a period of time to teach and train our people how to
            make these very unique and complex products, as they phase out of our
            Country, and back into their land. If we didn’t do this, all of that massive
            Investment will never come in the first place — Chips, Semiconductors,
            Computers, Ships, Trains, and so many other products that we have to learn
            from others how to make, or, in many cases, relearn, because we used to
            be great at it, but not anymore. For example, Shipbuilding, where we used
            to build a Ship a day and now, we barely build a Ship a year. I don’t
            want to frighten off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside
            Countries or Companies. We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and
            we are willing to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better
            than them at their own “game,” sometime into the not too distant future!

        - content: Today, I have the Great Honor of bringing a $15 Billion Dollar
            Defamation and Libel Lawsuit against The New York Times, one of the worst
            and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming
            a virtual “mouthpiece” for the Radical Left Democrat Party. I view it
            as the single largest illegal Campaign contribution, EVER. Their Endorsement
            of Kamala Harris was actually put dead center on the front page of The
            New York Times, something heretofore UNHEARD OF! The “Times” has engaged
            in a decades long method of lying about your Favorite President (ME!),
            my family, business, the America First Movement, MAGA, and our Nation
            as a whole. I am PROUD to hold this once respected “rag” responsible,
            as we are doing with the Fake News Networks such as our successful litigation
            against George Slopadopoulos/ABC/Disney, and 60 Minutes/CBS/Paramount,
            who knew that they were falsely “smearing” me through a highly sophisticated
            system of document and visual alteration, which was, in effect, a malicious
            form of defamation, and thus, settled for record amounts. They practiced
            this longterm INTENT and pattern of abuse, which is both unacceptable
            and illegal. The New York Times has been allowed to freely lie, smear,
            and defame me for far too long, and that stops, NOW! The suit is being
            brought in the Great State of Florida. Thank you for your attention to
            this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

            above ground to use them as human shields against Israel’s ground offensive.
            I hope the Leaders of Hamas know what they’re getting into if they do
            such a thing. This is a human atrocity, the likes of which few people
            have ever seen before. Don’t let this happen or, ALL “BETS” ARE OFF. RELEASE
            ALL HOSTAGES NOW!

        - content: This morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a SECOND
            Kinetic Strike against positively identified, extraordinarily violent
            drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.
            The Strike occurred while these confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela
            were in International Waters transporting illegal narcotics (A DEADLY
            WEAPON POISONING AMERICANS!) headed to the U.S. These extremely violent
            drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to U.S. National Security, Foreign
            Policy, and vital U.S. Interests. The Strike resulted in 3 male terrorists
            killed in action. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this Strike. BE WARNED
            — IF YOU ARE TRANSPORTING DRUGS THAT CAN KILL AMERICANS, WE ARE HUNTING
            YOU! The illicit activities by these cartels have wrought DEVASTATING
            CONSEQUENCES ON AMERICAN COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES, killing millions of
            American Citizens. NO LONGER. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!

        - content: Congressional Republicans, including Leader John Thune and Speaker
            Mike Johnson, are working on a short term “CLEAN” extension of Government
            Funding to stop Cryin’ Chuck Schumer from shutting down the Government.
            In times like these, Republicans have to stick TOGETHER to fight back
            against the Radical Left Democrat demands, and vote “YES!” on both Votes
            needed to pass a Clean CR this week out of the House of Representatives.
            Democrats want the Government to shut down. Republicans want the Government
            to OPEN. Democrats love CRIME, Republicans make our Country SAFE — WE
            HATE CRIME. FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION. Thank you for your attention to
            this matter! President DJT

        - content: RT @realDonaldTrumpWe honor the extraordinary life and service
            of Retired U.S. Army Sergeant Michael Verardo, a true American Hero, who
            gave everything for our Nation. After suffering catastrophic injuries
            from an IED in Afghanistan on April 24, 2010, Michael endured 120 surgeries
            with unwavering Courage, and the strong support of his incredible wife,
            Sarah, and three beautiful daughters. Sarah’s tireless advocacy for Wounded
            Warriors and Military Families exemplifies the Spirit of America. Michael's
            Legacy of Resilience, and Sarah's Selfless Dedication, will forever inspire
            us. Brave Patriots like Michael, and their families, will never be forgotten.
            We will cherish them in our hearts, forever!

        - content: Subject to SEC Approval, Companies and Corporations should no longer
            be forced to “Report” on a quarterly basis (Quarterly Reporting!), but
            rather to Report on a “Six (6) Month Basis.” This will save money, and
            allow managers to focus on properly running their companies. Did you ever
            hear the statement that, “China has a 50 to 100 year view on management
            of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???” Not
            good!!!

        - content: The NFL has to get rid of that ridiculous looking new Kickoff Rule.
            How can they make such a big and sweeping change so easily and quickly.
            It’s at least as dangerous as the “normal” kickoff, and looks like hell.
            The ball is moving, and the players are not, the exact opposite of what
            football is all about. “Sissy” football is bad for America, and bad for
            the NFL! Who comes up with these ridiculous ideas? It’s like wanting to
            “roll back” the golf ball so it doesn’t go (nearly!) as far. Fortunately,
            college football will remain the same, hopefully forever!!

        - content: The Federal Government, under my auspices as President of the United
            States of America, has stepped into the complete criminal mess that was
            Washington, D.C., our Nation’s Capital. Because of this, D.C. has gone
            from one of the most dangerous and murder ridden cities in the U.S.A.,
            and even around the World, to one of the safest - In just a few weeks.
            The “place” is absolutely booming, with restaurants, stores, and businesses
            packed and, for the first time in decades, virtually NO CRIME. It has
            been a beautiful thing to watch but, now, under pressure from the Radical
            Left Democrats, Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has presided over this violent
            criminal takeover of our Capital for years, has informed the Federal Government
            that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with
            ICE in removing and relocating dangerous illegal aliens. If I allowed
            this to happen, CRIME would come roaring back. To the people and businesses
            of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS
            TO HAPPEN. I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!
            Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!

        - content: I am aware of the terrible reports regarding the murder of Chandra
            Nagamallaiah, a well respected person in Dallas, Texas, who was brutally
            beheaded, in front of his wife and son, by an ILLEGAL ALIEN from Cuba
            who should have never been in our Country. This individual was previously
            arrested for terrible crimes, including child sex abuse, grand theft auto,
            and false imprisonment, but was released back into our Homeland under
            incompetent Joe Biden because Cuba did not want such an evil person in
            their Country. Rest assured, the time for being soft on these Illegal
            Immigrant Criminals is OVER under my watch! Secretary of Homeland Security
            Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Border Czar Tom Homan, and many
            others in my Administration, are doing an incredible job in, MAKING AMERICA
            SAFE AGAIN. This criminal, who we have in custody, will be prosecuted
            to the fullest extent of the Law. He will be charged with murder in the
            first degree!

        - content: 'It was my Great Honor to write the Foreword for George “Tyrus”
            Murdoch’s (Is he related to Rupert Murdoch?) new Book, “WHAT IT IS, AMERICA.”
            I have been fortunate in getting to know Tyrus, and he is a very smart
            and talented guy — And also a very good man. Throughout his career in
            Professional Wrestling and Television, he has earned the respect and admiration
            of millions. While Late Night Television Ratings have rapidly declined
            for others, Tyrus, working with the incredible Greg Gutfeld, and a group
            of wonderful people, have created something very special — A Late Night
            Show that is destroying Traditional Late Night Television, and the Radical
            Left who preside over it, in TV Ratings and beyond. Tyrus, using his iconic
            Wit, Humor, and Charm, to target the Deranged Trump Haters, and their
            joyless campaign against the American Way of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit
            of Happiness, is a STAR. He became famous for saying, long before the
            Election, “Why we are talking about the 2024 Presidential Election? It’s
            OVER. TRUMP is going to win, and everyone knows it. It’s a waste of time
            to talk about it. They’re not going to beat him, and they never will.”
            I used to laugh when I heard it, but he was right. In his wonderful new
            Book, Tyrus tells the true story of the 2024 Presidential Election, with
            his own unique insights, strongly rooted in Common Sense and Love for
            our Country. This Book is fantastic — Enjoy! Pre-Order today: https://a.co/d/ef3e2av'

        - content: When Foreign Companies who are building extremely complex products,
            machines, and various other “things,” come into the United States with
            massive Investments, I want them to bring their people of expertise for
            a period of time to teach and train our people how to make these very
            unique and complex products, as they phase out of our Country, and back
            into their land. If we didn’t do this, all of that massive Investment
            will never come in the first place — Chips, Semiconductors, Computers,
            Ships, Trains, and so many other products that we have to learn from others
            how to make, or, in many cases, relearn, because we used to be great at
            it, but not anymore. For example, Shipbuilding, where we used to build
            a Ship a day and now, we barely build a Ship a year. I don’t want to frighten
            off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or
            Companies. We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing
            to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at
            their own “game,” sometime into the not too distant future!

        - content: RT @realDonaldTrumpThe only reason crime is somewhat down in Memphis
            is because the FBI, and others in the Federal Government, at my direction,
            have been working there for 5 months - on the absolutely terrible Crime
            numbers. Likewise, in Chicago and Los Angeles! But the real work by us
            has barely begun. That happens after we make the official announcement
            that WE’RE COMING, and when we do that, as we did in now VERY SAFE WASHINGTON,
            D.C., the no crime “miracle” begins. ONLY I CAN SAVE THEM!!! Thank you
            for your attention to this matter. President DJT

        - content: Today, I have the Great Honor of bringing a $15 Billion Dollar
            Defamation and Libel Lawsuit against The New York Times, one of the worst
            and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming
            a virtual “mouthpiece” for the Radical Left Democrat Party. I view it
            as the single largest illegal Campaign contribution, EVER. Their Endorsement
            of Kamala Harris was actually put dead center on the front page of The
            New York Times, something heretofore UNHEARD OF! The “Times” has engaged
            in a decades long method of lying about your Favorite President (ME!),
            my family, business, the America First Movement, MAGA, and our Nation
            as a whole. I am PROUD to hold this once respected “rag” responsible,
            as we are doing with the Fake News Networks such as our successful litigation
            against George Slopadopoulos/ABC/Disney, and 60 Minutes/CBS/Paramount,
            who knew that they were falsely “smearing” me through a highly sophisticated
            system of document and visual alteration, which was, in effect, a malicious
            form of defamation, and thus, settled for record amounts. They practiced
            this longterm INTENT and pattern of abuse, which is both unacceptable
            and illegal. The New York Times has been allowed to freely lie, smear,
            and defame me for far too long, and that stops, NOW! The suit is being
            brought in the Great State of Florida. Thank you for your attention to
            this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

            I hope the Leaders of Hamas know what they’re getting into if they do
            such a thing. This is a human atrocity, the likes of which few people
            have ever seen before. Don’t let this happen or, ALL “BETS” ARE OFF. RELEASE

        - content: This morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a SECOND
            Kinetic Strike against positively identified, extraordinarily violent
            drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.
            The Strike occurred while these confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela
            were in International Waters transporting illegal narcotics (A DEADLY
            WEAPON POISONING AMERICANS!) headed to the U.S. These extremely violent
            drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to U.S. National Security, Foreign
            Policy, and vital U.S. Interests. The Strike resulted in 3 male terrorists
            killed in action. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this Strike. BE WARNED
            — IF YOU ARE TRANSPORTING DRUGS THAT CAN KILL AMERICANS, WE ARE HUNTING
            YOU! The illicit activities by these cartels have wrought DEVASTATING
            CONSEQUENCES ON AMERICAN COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES, killing millions of
            American Citizens. NO LONGER. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!

        - content: Congressional Republicans, including Leader John Thune and Speaker
            Mike Johnson, are working on a short term “CLEAN” extension of Government
            Funding to stop Cryin’ Chuck Schumer from shutting down the Government.
            In times like these, Republicans have to stick TOGETHER to fight back
            against the Radical Left Democrat demands, and vote “YES!” on both Votes
            needed to pass a Clean CR this week out of the House of Representatives.
            Democrats want the Government to shut down. Republicans want the Government
            to OPEN. Democrats love CRIME, Republicans make our Country SAFE — WE
            HATE CRIME. FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION. Thank you for your attention to
            this matter! President DJT

        - content: RT @realDonaldTrumpWe honor the extraordinary life and service
            of Retired U.S. Army Sergeant Michael Verardo, a true American Hero, who
            gave everything for our Nation. After suffering catastrophic injuries
            from an IED in Afghanistan on April 24, 2010, Michael endured 120 surgeries
            with unwavering Courage, and the strong support of his incredible wife,
            Sarah, and three beautiful daughters. Sarah’s tireless advocacy for Wounded
            Warriors and Military Families exemplifies the Spirit of America. Michael's
            Legacy of Resilience, and Sarah's Selfless Dedication, will forever inspire
            us. Brave Patriots like Michael, and their families, will never be forgotten.
            We will cherish them in our hearts, forever!

        - content: Subject to SEC Approval, Companies and Corporations should no longer
            be forced to “Report” on a quarterly basis (Quarterly Reporting!), but
            rather to Report on a “Six (6) Month Basis.” This will save money, and
            allow managers to focus on properly running their companies. Did you ever
            hear the statement that, “China has a 50 to 100 year view on management
            of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???” Not
            good!!!

        - content: The NFL has to get rid of that ridiculous looking new Kickoff Rule.
            How can they make such a big and sweeping change so easily and quickly.
            It’s at least as dangerous as the “normal” kickoff, and looks like hell.
            The ball is moving, and the players are not, the exact opposite of what
            football is all about. “Sissy” football is bad for America, and bad for
            the NFL! Who comes up with these ridiculous ideas? It’s like wanting to
            “roll back” the golf ball so it doesn’t go (nearly!) as far. Fortunately,
            college football will remain the same, hopefully forever!!

        - content: The Federal Government, under my auspices as President of the United
            States of America, has stepped into the complete criminal mess that was
            Washington, D.C., our Nation’s Capital. Because of this, D.C. has gone
            from one of the most dangerous and murder ridden cities in the U.S.A.,
            and even around the World, to one of the safest - In just a few weeks.
            The “place” is absolutely booming, with restaurants, stores, and businesses
            packed and, for the first time in decades, virtually NO CRIME. It has
            been a beautiful thing to watch but, now, under pressure from the Radical
            Left Democrats, Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has presided over this violent
            criminal takeover of our Capital for years, has informed the Federal Government
            that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with
            ICE in removing and relocating dangerous illegal aliens. If I allowed
            this to happen, CRIME would come roaring back. To the people and businesses
            of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS
            TO HAPPEN. I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!
            Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!

        - content: I am aware of the terrible reports regarding the murder of Chandra
            Nagamallaiah, a well respected person in Dallas, Texas, who was brutally
            beheaded, in front of his wife and son, by an ILLEGAL ALIEN from Cuba
            who should have never been in our Country. This individual was previously
            arrested for terrible crimes, including child sex abuse, grand theft auto,
            and false imprisonment, but was released back into our Homeland under
            incompetent Joe Biden because Cuba did not want such an evil person in
            their Country. Rest assured, the time for being soft on these Illegal
            Immigrant Criminals is OVER under my watch! Secretary of Homeland Security
            Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Border Czar Tom Homan, and many
            others in my Administration, are doing an incredible job in, MAKING AMERICA
            SAFE AGAIN. This criminal, who we have in custody, will be prosecuted
            to the fullest extent of the Law. He will be charged with murder in the
            first degree!

        - content: 'It was my Great Honor to write the Foreword for George “Tyrus”
            Murdoch’s (Is he related to Rupert Murdoch?) new Book, “WHAT IT IS, AMERICA.”
            I have been fortunate in getting to know Tyrus, and he is a very smart
            and talented guy — And also a very good man. Throughout his career in
            Professional Wrestling and Television, he has earned the respect and admiration
            of millions. While Late Night Television Ratings have rapidly declined
            for others, Tyrus, working with the incredible Greg Gutfeld, and a group
            of wonderful people, have created something very special — A Late Night
            Show that is destroying Traditional Late Night Television, and the Radical
            Left who preside over it, in TV Ratings and beyond. Tyrus, using his iconic
            Wit, Humor, and Charm, to target the Deranged Trump Haters, and their
            joyless campaign against the American Way of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit
            of Happiness, is a STAR. He became famous for saying, long before the
            Election, “Why we are talking about the 2024 Presidential Election? It’s
            OVER. TRUMP is going to win, and everyone knows it. It’s a waste of time
            to talk about it. They’re not going to beat him, and they never will.”
            I used to laugh when I heard it, but he was right. In his wonderful new
            Book, Tyrus tells the true story of the 2024 Presidential Election, with
            his own unique insights, strongly rooted in Common Sense and Love for
            our Country. This Book is fantastic — Enjoy! Pre-Order today: https://a.co/d/ef3e2av'

        - content: When Foreign Companies who are building extremely complex products,
            machines, and various other “things,” come into the United States with
            massive Investments, I want them to bring their people of expertise for
            a period of time to teach and train our people how to make these very
            unique and complex products, as they phase out of our Country, and back
            into their land. If we didn’t do this, all of that massive Investment
            will never come in the first place — Chips, Semiconductors, Computers,
            Ships, Trains, and so many other products that we have to learn from others
            how to make, or, in many cases, relearn, because we used to be great at
            it, but not anymore. For example, Shipbuilding, where we used to build
            a Ship a day and now, we barely build a Ship a year. I don’t want to frighten
            off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or
            Companies. We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing
            to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at
            their own “game,” sometime into the not too distant future!

        - content: RT @realDonaldTrumpThe only reason crime is somewhat down in Memphis
            is because the FBI, and others in the Federal Government, at my direction,
            have been working there for 5 months - on the absolutely terrible Crime
            numbers. Likewise, in Chicago and Los Angeles! But the real work by us
            has barely begun. That happens after we make the official announcement
            that WE’RE COMING, and when we do that, as we did in now VERY SAFE WASHINGTON,
            D.C., the no crime “miracle” begins. ONLY I CAN SAVE THEM!!! Thank you
            for your attention to this matter. President DJT

        - content: Today, I have the Great Honor of bringing a $15 Billion Dollar
            Defamation and Libel Lawsuit against The New York Times, one of the worst
            and most degenerate newspapers in the History of our Country, becoming
            a virtual “mouthpiece” for the Radical Left Democrat Party. I view it
            as the single largest illegal Campaign contribution, EVER. Their Endorsement
            of Kamala Harris was actually put dead center on the front page of The
            New York Times, something heretofore UNHEARD OF! The “Times” has engaged
            in a decades long method of lying about your Favorite President (ME!),
            my family, business, the America First Movement, MAGA, and our Nation
            as a whole. I am PROUD to hold this once respected “rag” responsible,
            as we are doing with the Fake News Networks such as our successful litigation
            against George Slopadopoulos/ABC/Disney, and 60 Minutes/CBS/Paramount,
            who knew that they were falsely “smearing” me through a highly sophisticated
            system of document and visual alteration, which was, in effect, a malicious
            form of defamation, and thus, settled for record amounts. They practiced
            this longterm INTENT and pattern of abuse, which is both unacceptable
            and illegal. The New York Times has been allowed to freely lie, smear,
            and defame me for far too long, and that stops, NOW! The suit is being
            brought in the Great State of Florida. Thank you for your attention to
            this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

            I hope the Leaders of Hamas know what they’re getting into if they do
            such a thing. This is a human atrocity, the likes of which few people
            have ever seen before. Don’t let this happen or, ALL “BETS” ARE OFF. RELEASE

        - content: This morning, on my Orders, U.S. Military Forces conducted a SECOND
            Kinetic Strike against positively identified, extraordinarily violent
            drug trafficking cartels and narcoterrorists in the SOUTHCOM area of responsibility.
            The Strike occurred while these confirmed narcoterrorists from Venezuela
            were in International Waters transporting illegal narcotics (A DEADLY
            WEAPON POISONING AMERICANS!) headed to the U.S. These extremely violent
            drug trafficking cartels POSE A THREAT to U.S. National Security, Foreign
            Policy, and vital U.S. Interests. The Strike resulted in 3 male terrorists
            killed in action. No U.S. Forces were harmed in this Strike. BE WARNED
            — IF YOU ARE TRANSPORTING DRUGS THAT CAN KILL AMERICANS, WE ARE HUNTING
            YOU! The illicit activities by these cartels have wrought DEVASTATING
            CONSEQUENCES ON AMERICAN COMMUNITIES FOR DECADES, killing millions of
            American Citizens. NO LONGER. Thank you for your attention to this matter!!!

        - content: Congressional Republicans, including Leader John Thune and Speaker
            Mike Johnson, are working on a short term “CLEAN” extension of Government
            Funding to stop Cryin’ Chuck Schumer from shutting down the Government.
            In times like these, Republicans have to stick TOGETHER to fight back
            against the Radical Left Democrat demands, and vote “YES!” on both Votes
            needed to pass a Clean CR this week out of the House of Representatives.
            Democrats want the Government to shut down. Republicans want the Government
            to OPEN. Democrats love CRIME, Republicans make our Country SAFE — WE
            HATE CRIME. FAILURE IS NOT AN OPTION. Thank you for your attention to

        - content: RT @realDonaldTrumpWe honor the extraordinary life and service
            of Retired U.S. Army Sergeant Michael Verardo, a true American Hero, who
            gave everything for our Nation. After suffering catastrophic injuries
            from an IED in Afghanistan on April 24, 2010, Michael endured 120 surgeries
            with unwavering Courage, and the strong support of his incredible wife,
            Sarah, and three beautiful daughters. Sarah’s tireless advocacy for Wounded
            Warriors and Military Families exemplifies the Spirit of America. Michael's
            Legacy of Resilience, and Sarah's Selfless Dedication, will forever inspire
            us. Brave Patriots like Michael, and their families, will never be forgotten.
            We will cherish them in our hearts, forever!

        - content: Subject to SEC Approval, Companies and Corporations should no longer
            be forced to “Report” on a quarterly basis (Quarterly Reporting!), but
            rather to Report on a “Six (6) Month Basis.” This will save money, and
            allow managers to focus on properly running their companies. Did you ever
            hear the statement that, “China has a 50 to 100 year view on management
            of a company, whereas we run our companies on a quarterly basis???” Not
            good!!!

        - content: The NFL has to get rid of that ridiculous looking new Kickoff Rule.
            How can they make such a big and sweeping change so easily and quickly.
            It’s at least as dangerous as the “normal” kickoff, and looks like hell.
            The ball is moving, and the players are not, the exact opposite of what
            football is all about. “Sissy” football is bad for America, and bad for
            the NFL! Who comes up with these ridiculous ideas? It’s like wanting to
            “roll back” the golf ball so it doesn’t go (nearly!) as far. Fortunately,
            college football will remain the same, hopefully forever!!

        - content: The Federal Government, under my auspices as President of the United
            States of America, has stepped into the complete criminal mess that was
            Washington, D.C., our Nation’s Capital. Because of this, D.C. has gone
            from one of the most dangerous and murder ridden cities in the U.S.A.,
            and even around the World, to one of the safest - In just a few weeks.
            The “place” is absolutely booming, with restaurants, stores, and businesses
            packed and, for the first time in decades, virtually NO CRIME. It has
            been a beautiful thing to watch but, now, under pressure from the Radical
            Left Democrats, Mayor Muriel Bowser, who has presided over this violent
            criminal takeover of our Capital for years, has informed the Federal Government
            that the Metropolitan Police Department will no longer cooperate with
            ICE in removing and relocating dangerous illegal aliens. If I allowed
            this to happen, CRIME would come roaring back. To the people and businesses
            of Washington, D.C., DON’T WORRY, I AM WITH YOU, AND WON’T ALLOW THIS
            TO HAPPEN. I’ll call a National Emergency, and Federalize, if necessary!!!
            Thank you for your attention to this matter. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!

        - content: I am aware of the terrible reports regarding the murder of Chandra
            Nagamallaiah, a well respected person in Dallas, Texas, who was brutally
            beheaded, in front of his wife and son, by an ILLEGAL ALIEN from Cuba
            who should have never been in our Country. This individual was previously
            arrested for terrible crimes, including child sex abuse, grand theft auto,
            and false imprisonment, but was released back into our Homeland under
            incompetent Joe Biden because Cuba did not want such an evil person in
            their Country. Rest assured, the time for being soft on these Illegal
            Immigrant Criminals is OVER under my watch! Secretary of Homeland Security
            Kristi Noem, Attorney General Pam Bondi, Border Czar Tom Homan, and many
            others in my Administration, are doing an incredible job in, MAKING AMERICA
            SAFE AGAIN. This criminal, who we have in custody, will be prosecuted
            to the fullest extent of the Law. He will be charged with murder in the
            first degree!

        - content: 'It was my Great Honor to write the Foreword for George “Tyrus”
            Murdoch’s (Is he related to Rupert Murdoch?) new Book, “WHAT IT IS, AMERICA.”
            I have been fortunate in getting to know Tyrus, and he is a very smart
            and talented guy — And also a very good man. Throughout his career in
            Professional Wrestling and Television, he has earned the respect and admiration
            of millions. While Late Night Television Ratings have rapidly declined
            for others, Tyrus, working with the incredible Greg Gutfeld, and a group
            of wonderful people, have created something very special — A Late Night
            Show that is destroying Traditional Late Night Television, and the Radical
            Left who preside over it, in TV Ratings and beyond. Tyrus, using his iconic
            Wit, Humor, and Charm, to target the Deranged Trump Haters, and their
            joyless campaign against the American Way of Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit
            of Happiness, is a STAR. He became famous for saying, long before the
            Election, “Why we are talking about the 2024 Presidential Election? It’s
            OVER. TRUMP is going to win, and everyone knows it. It’s a waste of time
            to talk about it. They’re not going to beat him, and they never will.”
            I used to laugh when I heard it, but he was right. In his wonderful new
            Book, Tyrus tells the true story of the 2024 Presidential Election, with
            his own unique insights, strongly rooted in Common Sense and Love for
            our Country. This Book is fantastic — Enjoy! Pre-Order today: https://a.co/d/ef3e2av'

            into their land. If we didn’t do this, all of that massive Investment
            will never come in the first place — Chips, Semiconductors, Computers,
            Ships, Trains, and so many other products that we have to learn from others
            how to make, or, in many cases, relearn, because we used to be great at
            it, but not anymore. For example, Shipbuilding, where we used to build
            a Ship a day and now, we barely build a Ship a year. I don’t want to frighten
            off or disincentivize Investment into America by outside Countries or
            Companies. We welcome them, we welcome their employees, and we are willing
            to proudly say we will learn from them, and do even better than them at
            their own “game,” sometime into the not too distant future!
