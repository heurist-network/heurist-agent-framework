    - content: Terrible helicopter crash in the Hudson River. Looks like six people,
        the pilot, two adults, and three children, are no longer with us. The footage
        of the accident is horrendous. God bless the families and friends of the victims.
        Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, and his talented staff are on it.
        Announcements as to exactly what took place, and how, will be made shortly!

    - content: Mexico OWES Texas 1.3 million acre-feet of water under the 1944 Water
        Treaty, but Mexico is unfortunately violating their Treaty obligation. This
        is very unfair, and it is hurting South Texas Farmers very badly. Last year,
        the only Sugar Mill in Texas CLOSED, because Mexico has been stealing the
        water from Texas Farmers. Ted Cruz has been leading the fight to get South
        Texas the water it is owed, but Sleepy Joe refused to lift a finger to help
        the Farmers.THAT ENDS NOW! I will make sure Mexico doesn’t violate our Treaties,
        and doesn’t hurt our Texas Farmers. Just last month, I halted water shipments
        to Tijuana until Mexico complies with the 1944 Water Treaty. My Agriculture
        Secretary, Brooke Rollins, is standing up for Texas Farmers, and we will keep
        escalating consequences, including TARIFFS and, maybe even SANCTIONS, until
        Mexico honors the Treaty, and GIVES TEXAS THE WATER THEY ARE OWED!

        Left Open Border Extremist, who will put our Country, and Safety, LAST. Pete,
        on the other hand, will ALWAYS put Nebraska, and America, FIRST. Senator Pete
        Ricketts has my Complete and Total Endorsement for Re-Election — HE WILL NEVER

    - content: It’s so hard to watch as Highly Qualified and Respected Ambassadors,
        who we desperately need representing our Country in Faraway Lands, are purposefully
        meant to wait as the Democrat Senators take maximum time for every single
        one of them, even though they were confirmed with Bipartisan Support, also
        at maximum time, and only done to hurt our Country. A process that should
        take a matter of minutes is forced into taking months, making it very hard
        on the new Ambassadors’ families, and not good, at all, for the Good Ole’
        U.S.A. In a true sense, in numerous cases, what they do is actually a Threat
        to National Security. John Thune and the Republicans are doing a great job,
        but nothing much can be done when the Democrats make everyone sit, day after
        day, pushing the limits. The level of hostility is not to be believed!

    - content: It’s so hard to watch as Highly Qualified and Respected Ambassadors,
        who we desperately need representing our Country in Faraway Lands, are purposefully
        meant to wait as the Democrat Senators take maximum time for every single
        one of them, even though they were confirmed with Bipartisan Support, also
        at maximum time, and only done to hurt our Country. A process that should
        take a matter of minutes is forced into taking months, making it very hard
        on the new Ambassadors’ families, and not good, at all, for the Good Ole’
        U.S.A. In a true sense, in numerous cases, what they do is actually a Threat
        to National Security. John Thune and the Republicans are doing a great job,
        but nothing much can be done when the Democrats make everyone sit, day after
        day, pushing the limits. The level of hostility is not to be believed!

        the pilot, two adults, and three children, are no longer with us. The footage
        of the accident is horrendous. God bless the families and friends of the victims.
        Secretary of Transportation, Sean Duffy, and his talented staff are on it.
        Announcements as to exactly what took place, and how, will be made shortly!

    - content: Mexico OWES Texas 1.3 million acre-feet of water under the 1944 Water
        Treaty, but Mexico is unfortunately violating their Treaty obligation. This
        is very unfair, and it is hurting South Texas Farmers very badly. Last year,
        the only Sugar Mill in Texas CLOSED, because Mexico has been stealing the
        water from Texas Farmers. Ted Cruz has been leading the fight to get South
        Texas the water it is owed, but Sleepy Joe refused to lift a finger to help
        the Farmers.THAT ENDS NOW! I will make sure Mexico doesn’t violate our Treaties,
        and doesn’t hurt our Texas Farmers. Just last month, I halted water shipments
        to Tijuana until Mexico complies with the 1944 Water Treaty. My Agriculture
        Secretary, Brooke Rollins, is standing up for Texas Farmers, and we will keep
        escalating consequences, including TARIFFS and, maybe even SANCTIONS, until
        Mexico honors the Treaty, and GIVES TEXAS THE WATER THEY ARE OWED!
