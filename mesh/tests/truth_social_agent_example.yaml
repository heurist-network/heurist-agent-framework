        does! All over the World, the Allies are celebrating the Victory we had in
        World War II. The only Country that doesn’t celebrate is the United States
        of America, and the Victory was only accomplished because of us. Without the
        United States, the War would have been won by other Countries, and what a
        different World it would be. Therefore, I am hereby declaring a National Holiday
        in celebration of the Victories of World War I, where the Armistice was signed
        on November 11, 1918, and World War II, where the Victory date was May 8,

    - content: I just had a very good and productive telephone conversation with the
        President of Turkey, Recep Erdoğan, concerning many subjects, including the
        War with Russia/Ukraine, all things Syria, Gaza, and more. The President invited
        me to go to Turkey at a future date and, likewise, he will be coming to Washington,
        D.C. During my four years as President, my relationship with President Erdoğan
        was excellent. We worked together closely on numerous things, including the
        fact that he helped return Pastor Andrew Brunson, who was imprisoned, back
        to the United States — Immediately upon my request. In any event, I look forward
        to working with President Erdoğan on getting the ridiculous, but deadly, War
        between Russia and Ukraine ended — NOW!

    - content: Ed Martin is going through the approval process to be U.S. Attorney
        in the District of Columbia. According to many but, in particular, Robert
        F. Kennedy, Jr., his approval is IMPERATIVE in terms of doing all that has
        to be done to SAVE LIVES and to, MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN. This is a passion
        for Ed, more so than for almost anyone that I have seen. One of the reasons
        that I was so successful in winning the 2024 Presidential Election is my commitment
        to Health, and helping to Make America Healthy. The Cost of the Chronic Disease
        Epidemic has gotten out of control over the past four years of the Biden Presidency.
        We are going to take our Country BACK, and FAST. Ed Martin will be a big player
        in doing so and, I hope, that the Republican Senators will make a commitment
        to his approval, which is now before them. Ed is coming up on the deadline
        for Voting and, if approved, HE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN. When some day in the
        future you look back at your Vote for Ed Martin, you will be very proud of
        what you have done for America and America’s Health. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

    - content: Radical Left Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser ignores Illegals
        committing Violent Crimes like Rape and Murder in his State and, instead,
        jailed Tina Peters, a 69-year-old Gold Star mother who worked to expose and
        document Democrat Election Fraud. Tina is an innocent Political Prisoner being
        horribly and unjustly punished in the form of Cruel and Unusual Punishment.
        This is a Communist persecution by the Radical Left Democrats to cover up
        their Election crimes and misdeeds in 2020. The same Democrat Party that flies
        to El Salvador to try to free an MS-13 Terrorist, is cruelly imprisoning,
        perhaps for life, a grandmother whose brave and heroic son gave his life for
        America. Colorado must end this unjust incarceration of an innocent American.
        I am hereby directing the Department of Justice to take all necessary action
        to help secure the release of this “hostage” being held in a Colorado prison
        by the Democrats, for political reasons. FREE TINA PETERS, NOW!

    - content: We won two World Wars, but we never took credit for it — Everyone else
        does! All over the World, the Allies are celebrating the Victory we had in
        World War II. The only Country that doesn’t celebrate is the United States
        of America, and the Victory was only accomplished because of us. Without the
        United States, the War would have been won by other Countries, and what a
        different World it would be. Therefore, I am hereby declaring a National Holiday
        in celebration of the Victories of World War I, where the Armistice was signed
        on November 11, 1918, and World War II, where the Victory date was May 8,
        1945. We will not be closing the Country for these two very important Holidays,
        November 11 and May 8, World War I and World War II, because we already have
        too many Holidays in America — There are not enough days left in the year.
        We were Workers then, and we are Workers now! Documentation to follow. MAKE
        AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
