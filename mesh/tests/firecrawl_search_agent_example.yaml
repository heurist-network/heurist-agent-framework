          \n# 01\\. Introduction\n\nIn a digital age rife with data breaches and online\
          \ vulnerabilities, building trust is more crucial than ever. Zero knowledge\
          \ proofs (zk proofs) offer an elegant solution beyond traditional privacy\
          \ measures by allowing one party to verify certain information without ever\
          \ disclosing the information itself.\n\nExperts say zk proofs have the potential\
          \ to revolutionize various industries, from finance and healthcare to luxury\
          \ fashion and decentralized systems like blockchain, ushering in a new era\
          \ of security and assurance. Independent research shows that zk proof generation\
          \ will become a $\\\\mathfrak{s}\\\\i0$ billion market by the year 2030.\
          \ Web3 services will require almost 90 billion zk proofs to be performed\
          \ in 2030, with market-wide completion of 83,000 transactions per second.\
          \ This report will cover some familiar zk proof territory, including the\
          \ differences between zk-STARKs and zkSNARKs, a timeline of innovations\
          \ in this space, challenges and future projections. The focus, however,\
          \ is today’s exciting inflection point where zk proofs are moving from research\
          \ projects to serious business – an analysis derived from new and firsthand\
          \ accounts from leading companies within the ecosystem of $^{250+}$ companies\
          \ that form the Protocol Labs innovation network. With a shared mission\
          \ to shape the future of computing, PL companies — including CryptoNet,\
          \ Gensyn, Ingonyama, Lurk Lab, Polybase, Rarimo, StarkWare, Zama — have\
          \ contributed to the world of zk proofs for years and will share their exclusive\
          \ insights in this report.\n\nCompanies like Lurk Lab zero in on the complex\
          \ mathematical models that form the basis of zk proofs. They believe the\
          \ zk proof space is poised for growth:\n\n“There’s been a decade of work\
          \ to improve zk protocols that are leading to real business – we’re even\
          \ seeing boutique venture capital firms that exclusively invest in this\
          \ space. We are at an inflection point of better technology and more capital\
          \ moving towards zk proofs,\" said John Burnham, cofounder of Lurk Lab.\
          \ \"It’s a Cambrian explosion.”\n\nThis report features exclusive research\
          \ and expert commentary on the properties of zk proofs, use cases, challenges,\
          \ potential disruptors, signs of momentum and future outlook.\n\nIngonyama,\
          \ a PL network team that solves for hardware limitations by building semi-conductors\
          \ to accelerate zkSNARKs, stresses the importance of privacy in the next\
          \ iteration of the internet:\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/22a3ae6e-5c50-43d0-afca-291f62041cc8/images/56ff147a935b9d92a3fcdecfc44cadc9fa3fcaef306b761939add29d16821bea.jpg)\n\
          \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Information is the most\
          \ valuable currency in the world. Yet we are all guilty of oversharing our\
          \ data to third parties on the internet. Today if you want to prove one\
          \ aspect of yourself, such as age, you must upload an ID which contains\
          \ so much extra information —  full name, address, country of citizenship,\
          \ etc. What happens to that data? Often we find it's been leaked or stolen.\
          \ This scenario happens every day in the digital world. The problem of oversharing\
          \ can be solved by zk proofs, which are the most powerful cryptography that\
          \ exists today for hiding data, while allowing for assertions on that data.\
          \ ZK proofs are considered one of the greatest achievements of cryptography\
          \ in the last 50 years.”\n\n# 02\\. What are ZeroKnowledge Proofs?\n\nPicture\
          \ this:\n\nYou’re driving in an upscale neighborhood and spot the perfect\
          \ house. You dial the realtor’s number, ready to hear the asking price.\
          \ What if there was a way to prove to the realtor right away that you’re\
          \ good for the money — no matter the cost — without revealing the total\
          \ amount in your bank account? You could maintain your financial privacy\
          \ and put in an offer right away.\n\nHere enters the concept of a zero knowledge\
          \ proof (zk proof). In this scenario, you present a zk proof to confirm\
          \ you have enough funds for the down payment without revealing your entire\
          \ bank balance or personal wealth. By establishing trust without unnecessary\
          \ disclosures, zk proofs find practical application in various daily scenarios\
          \ — ensuring secure digital transactions, verifying identity without exposing\
          \ sensitive data, and revolutionizing privacy in the digital age.\n\nIn\
          \ 1985, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff first introduced\
          \ the concept of zk proofs to the world. Years later, one of their mentees,\
          \ Rosario Gennaro, a researcher and former data scientist at Protocol Labs,\
          \ wrote a highly cited paper about more efficient, publicly verifiable computer\
          \ schemes that is still relied on today. He shares an example of a zk proof\
          \ with a technical explanation here:\n\n# Step by Step Example of a ZK Proof\n\
          \nstep 01.\n\nstep 02.\n\n# Setup\n\nEmily and David agree on the secret\
          \ vault's combination, but they want to ensure that Emily truly knows it\
          \ without exposing it.\n\n# Prover (Emily)\n\nEmily takes on the role of\
          \ the prover. She uses a zk proof technique to demonstrate her knowledge\
          \ of the combination without revealing what it is. Instead of showing the\
          \ combination directly, she performs a series of cryptographic operations\
          \ that prove she possesses the knowledge.\n\n# step 04.\n\nstep 03.\n\n\
          # Proof Generation\n\nEmily follows David's instructions using the knowledge\
          \ she has without revealing the combination itself. She provides the result\
          \ of her operations to David.\n\n# Verifier (David)\n\nDavid is the verifier\
          \ in this scenario. He wants to be convinced that Emily actually knows the\
          \ combination. David challenges Emily by asking her to prove her knowledge.\
          \ He provides specific instructions, such as asking her to perform operations\
          \ on the combination without revealing it.\n\n# step 05.\n\n# Verification\n\
          \nDavid checks Emily's response. If it's correct based on the instructions\
          \ he provided, he becomes convinced that Emily knows the combination without\
          \ actually learning the combination himself. If Emily didn't know the combination,\
          \ it would be highly improbable for her to consistently provide correct\
          \ responses based on David's instructions.\n\nIn this example, the prover\
          \ (Emily) demonstrates her knowledge of the combination to the verifier\
          \ (David) without revealing the actual combination. This showcases the core\
          \ concept of zk proofs, where one party can prove knowledge of certain information\
          \ without disclosing that information to the other party, ensuring privacy\
          \ and security in various applications like authentication and cryptography.\n\

          \n# 2019\n\nThe zk-SNARKs project releases Halo, a new zk-SNARKs system\
          \ that is more efficient and scalable than previous systems.\n\n# 2021\n\
          \nThe Ethereum Foundation announces the launch of the zkEVM project, which\
          \ aims to bring zk proofs to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n2021\n\nzkSync,\
          \ a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum using zk rollups, gains attention.\n\
          \n2021\n\nCairo, a programming language for zk-SNARKs, is introduced by\
          \ StarkWare, simplifying the development of zk-rollup solutions.\n\n# 2020\n\
          \nA Note on zk-SNARKS vs zk-STARKS\n\nFilecoin mainnet launches as a decentralized\
          \ storage network and cryptocurrency. Filecoin is currently the largest\
          \ deployed zk-SNARK to date. By 2023, the Filecoin network produces 6-7\
          \ million zk-SNARK proofs daily, each proof encompassing over 100 million\
          \ arithmetic constraints.\n\n2022\n\nThe zkSync project releases zkSync\
          \ 2.0, a new zk rollup that is designed to be more efficient and scalable\
          \ than previous zk rollups.\n\nTwo cryptographic techniques, created in\
          \ tandem, fall under the umbrella of zk proofs: zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs.\
          \ Both aim to achieve similar goals of proving the validity of statements\
          \ without revealing the underlying data, but they differ in their underlying\
          \ mechanisms and use cases~\n\nvzk-SNARK is a type of zk proof that allows\
          \ a prover to demonstrate the truth of a statement to a verifier in a succinct\
          \ and non-interactive manner. It's particularly associated with privacy-preserving\
          \ transactions in blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, like Zcash.\x88\
          \ vzk-STARK is another type of zk proof that also allows for proving the\
          \ validity of statements without revealing the underlying data. Though it\
          \ requires interaction, it achieves better security by removing the need\
          \ for trusted setups, unlike zk-SNARKs.\n\nFor details on zk-SNARKS vs zk-STARKS,\
          \ read this piece by PL network team Consensys.\n\n# 04\\. Current Major\
          \ Use Cases\n\nZK proofs have found diverse applications across various\
          \ fields due to their unique ability to verify information without revealing\
          \ the underlying data. Here are five major use cases:\n\n# Voting Systems\n\
          \nIn a zk proof-based voting system, voters can prove that their vote is\
          \ valid without revealing the actual choice they made. This maintains the\
          \ secrecy of individual votes, while ensuring that the total count is accurate.\
          \ Similar to the way they are used today by DAOs, zk proofs can be used\
          \ to verify properties of the election process, such as the absence of double\
          \ voting or the integrity of the tally, without revealing specific voter\
          \ information.\n\n# Cryptocurrencies\n\nZcash may be the most notable cryptocurrency\
          \ dedicated to preserving privacy – and zk proofs play a crucial role. They\
          \ enable confidential transactions where the sender, receiver, and transaction\
          \ amounts are hidden, while still ensuring the validity of transactions.\
          \ ZK proofs can also verify the correctness of smart contracts without revealing\
          \ the underlying data.\n\n# Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nResearch shows\
          \ that the DeFi market is growing rapidly and consistently, nearly doubling\
          \ each year since 2018. According to data, the market is set to reach $\\\
          \\mathbb{567.4}$ billion by 2026. This translates to corresponding growth\
          \ in the zk proof space, as DeFi platforms leverage zk proofs to enhance\
          \ privacy and scalability.\n\nZK proofs are used to validate transactions\
          \ and operations off-chain, while providing cryptographic proof of their\
          \ correctness on-chain. This reduces the computational load on the blockchain\
          \ and speeds up transaction processing. ZK proofs can also be used in decentralized\
          \ exchanges to prove that users possess the necessary funds for trading\
          \ without disclosing their exact balances.\n\nSince 2019, when DeFi was\
          \ relatively new, its quarter-on-quarter growth has risen at a rapid rate,\
          \ with over 6 million unique wallets completing an onchain transaction each\
          \ month since late-2022.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/22a3ae6e-5c50-43d0-afca-291f62041cc8/images/7c559b632ab6131d332d3f8eea7f47f8277d096db11dd432fc77de4c79a1dfe6.jpg)\n\
          \nnumber of active defi users\n\n# Supply Chain Transparency and Traceability\n\
          \nZK proofs can be used to verify and authenticate the origin, movement,\
          \ and authenticity of products within a supply chain without revealing sensitive\
          \ proprietary information. This can enhance transparency by allowing different\
          \ entities to independently verify the accuracy of claims made about products,\
          \ such as their source, quality, and journey through the supply chain. For\
          \ example, zk proofs could be employed to prove that a product was ethically\
          \ sourced, without disclosing proprietary supplier data.\n\n# Environmental\
          \ Standards\n\nZK proofs can be applied to verify compliance with environmental\
          \ standards without revealing sensitive business data. For instance, companies\
          \ can demonstrate that they meet certain emissions reduction targets without\
          \ sharing specific emission levels or proprietary information. This aids\
          \ in maintaining transparency and accountability while protecting sensitive\
          \ information.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/22a3ae6e-5c50-43d0-afca-291f62041cc8/images/c2f311339e4d23e49af6697ef3a576f8b443b426322a4a681843186f3e956e57.jpg)\n\
          \nSid Gandhi, co-founder of Polybase Powered by zk proofs, Polybase is a\
          \ layer 2 blockchain with private transactions and MEV-resistance. A member\
          \ of the PL innovation network, Polybase’s co-founder Sid Gandhi shares\
          \ an example of an energy use case in the real world.\n\n“One of the largest\
          \ European energy companies wants to offer transparent data around renewable\
          \ energy generation. Rather than quarterly manual audits, we look at real\
          \ time data being generated from renewable resources. What percentage of\
          \ the energy generated and sent to this particular client is green? Doing\
          \ that in a cryptographically verifiable way isn't really possible. Consider\
          \ data centers that don't want to reveal second-by-second energy data that\
          \ they are consuming – that can be used for competitive intelligence.\n\n\
          What we allow with zk is the ability to keep that private data private,\
          \ but then prove some public attributes of that data. So we could prove\
          \ points like: what percentage of the data generated at this particular\
          \ time is renewable? That's a very motivating use case for us, because that\
          \ solves a real problem in the real world that we've seen with real customers.\
          \ It's really exciting for us to be able to tackle this problem.”\n\n# 05\\\
          . 4 Exciting Bets in ZK Proofs\n\nIn the evolving landscape of zk proof\

          \ are pushing the boundaries of what's possible, with a primary focus on\
          \ enhancing efficiency, scalability, and usability. These innovative efforts\
          \ are not only shaping the future of zk proofs, but also working towards\
          \ broader adoption across various domains.\n\nAs these projects continue\
          \ to mature and gain traction, the potential for zk proofs to revolutionize\
          \ industries beyond cryptocurrency becomes increasingly evident, offering\
          \ a promising future where privacy and security are paramount in our digital\
          \ interactions.\n\nResearch shows that\n\n6 The zk proof market is projected\
          \ to reach $\\\\mathbb{575}$ million in revenue in 2024,\n\n6 Has the potential\
          \ to exceed $\\\\mathfrak{s}\\\\mathord{\\\\uparrow}0$ billion in revenue\
          \ by the year 2030,\n\n6 Web3 applications alone are expected to require\

          \n# 2zkSync\n\nA method and project focused on developing zk rollups, a\
          \ type of layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. ZK rollups use zk proofs\
          \ to bundle multiple transactions together, verify them off-chain, and then\
          \ submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This significantly reduces\
          \ the computational load on the Ethereum network and enhances its scalability.\
          \ Examples8\n\n^ zkSync is also the name of a specific project that has\
          \ been developed to implement this method. It is initiated and maintained\

          \ of blockchain networks. The zkSync project includes the development of\
          \ the zkSync protocol, smart contract infrastructure, and associated toolsA\n\
          \n^ Emerging zk rollups, such as zkSync Era, have witnessed a growth in\

          \ in zk proof systems, making them more efficient for applications with\
          \ a high transaction volume.  Usually, the way it is used is in evolving\
          \ computation: First, it breaks the computation to be proven into smaller\
          \ steps and proves them iteratively. Each step contains a proof, proving\
          \ the current state of the computation. Then, a new proof for the next step\
          \ can be generated by using the current step and its proof recursively showing\
          \ the correctness of all prior steps alltogether. The proof update does\
          \ not require recomputing from the very first step as in a standard zk proof,\
          \ and it is independent of the total length of the computation.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/22a3ae6e-5c50-43d0-afca-291f62041cc8/images/50a077cf990e6a7568d6590328c1d3f1f580cd29ede2dad7a403e04a5f986657.jpg)\n\

          \n# 07\\. Challenges & Hurdles\n\n# 1Computational Complexity\n\nZK proofs\
          \ offer exciting possibilities for privacy, security, and efficiency. However,\
          \ they also come with several technical challenges and adoption barriers\
          \ for researchers, developers, and practitioners working in the realm of\
          \ zk proofs. These multifaceted issues range from efficiency and scalability\
          \ limitations to concerns about security assumptions and real world implications.\
          \ By addressing these challenges, the cryptographic community can pave the\
          \ way for the broader utilization of zk proofs in domains ranging from blockchain\
          \ and cybersecurity to privacypreserving technologies and beyond. Here are\
          \ five challenges currently in focus:\n\nMany zk proof systems involve the\
          \ use of sophisticated cryptographic operations applied to a complex mathematical\
          \ representation of a computer program. This complexity can make it challenging\
          \ for developers to adopt and integrate zk proofs into their applications.\
          \ It also affects the efficiency and scalability of large-scale zk systems.\n\
          \n“The main challenge is around the balance of cost, time and proof size.\
          \ This is the Holy Grail: to generate a proof with zero overhead and super\
          \ small proof size. Now, we have achieved super small proof sizes, but with\
          \ other big trade-offs. Generally the trade-off is: it becomes more expensive.”\n\
          \nNicola Greco, research scientist, CryptoNet\n\n# 2Scalability\n\nWhile\
          \ zk proofs can aggregate multiple proofs and transactions, scalability\
          \ challenges can arise when dealing with a high volume of transactions.\
          \ Generating and verifying a large number of proofs may introduce bottlenecks.\
          \ Achieving strong privacy guarantees through zk proofs might involve trade-offs\
          \ in terms of transaction speed, network overhead, or computational load.\
          \ Striking the right balance between privacy and performance is crucial.\n\
          \nResearch scientist Rosario Gennaro explains that building a zk proof involves\
          \ running a program that stores the state of the virtual machine at every\
          \ step of the proof, making space a bottleneck to growth and speed of transaction.\
          \ Folding schemes present a solution for proofs that are computed at every\
          \ step of a computation: given a proof with correct computation up to, for\
          \ example, step 4, the next correctness proof is obtain by \"folding\" the\
          \ proof of correctness of step 5 into the previous proof, without the need\
          \ to store the state of the computation at every stage.\n\nRosario Gennaro,\
          \ Professor at The City University of New York\n\n“Instead of writing the\
          \ entire transcript for the computation down at each step, folding compresses\
          \ the computation and solves the space problem. There is a lot of work happening\
          \ on implementing folding schemes to build efficient zk virtual machines,\
          \ ranging from Web2 companies like Microsoft to cutting edge startups like\
          \ Lurk Lab. While this bottleneck hasn’t been fully resolved, it’s one area\
          \ where we are ahead of the curve to solve the issue and definitely an area\
          \ to watch.”\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/22a3ae6e-5c50-43d0-afca-291f62041cc8/images/370bc7f5887fac864386679801cf1ffab6db8b6348a297eca19eca6642988b8e.jpg)\n\
          \n# 3Trusted Setup\n\nSome zk proof systems require a trusted setup phase\
          \ to generate initial parameters. The trusted setup phase requires that\
          \ the individuals or entity responsible for generating these parameters\
          \ act honestly and do not keep any secret information that could compromise\
          \ the security of the system. If this setup is compromised or not performed\
          \ correctly, it can undermine the security and privacy guarantees of the\
          \ system. The field of zk proofs is rapidly evolving, with new advancements\
          \ and potential vulnerabilities regularly emerging. Continuous research\
          \ and development are essential to address security issues and improve the\
          \ efficiency of zk proof systems.\n\n# 4Interoperability\n\nDifferent zk\
          \ proof systems might use distinct standards and protocols, making it challenging\
          \ to achieve interoperability between different systems. Creating common\
          \ standards would enhance compatibility and efforts are currently underway\
          \ with the likes of The ZKProof Community. ZK proofs also often come with\
          \ proof sizes that can be large, making them less efficient to transmit\
          \ and store. Efforts to minimize proof size while maintaining security are\
          \ ongoing. To support standardization, Polybase has released a new zk benchmark\
          \ site,  [https://zkbench.dev/](https://zkbench.dev/), with detailed comparison\
          \ tables and open community reviews.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/22a3ae6e-5c50-43d0-afca-291f62041cc8/images/df233b43e2367705b1d403af7683e60927bdac7de5c1e23a174e60a5cd9ea30b.jpg)\n\
          \nSid Gandhi, co-founder of Polybase “We're at that phase in the industry\
          \ where people understand the high level capability, like keeping data private,\
          \ proving things publicly, but there is still a big educational aspect around\
          \ the trade-offs and the technical implementation, and, potentially, what\
          \ other options are available, what trade-offs exist with those options\
          \ as well. So, we are doing quite a bit of education. And then, the next\
          \ step after that is selling our actual product. So it's a two-step process\
          \ right now.”\n\n# Hardware Acceleration\n\nHardware acceleration techniques,\
          \ such as using trusted execution environments (TEEs) or specialized hardware\
          \ like ASICs, have enabled faster and more efficient computation of zk proofs.\
          \ This breakthrough has the potential to make zk proofs practical for real-time\
          \ applications.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/22a3ae6e-5c50-43d0-afca-291f62041cc8/images/8eda1ef245afb5cead9ee087f634d29759311a06dccf3e7ee5a302364ef89ab0.jpg)\n\
          \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Today's hardware is not\
          \ built for zero knowledge. ZK proofs require a massive amount of computational\
          \ resources and existing hardware (CPUs, GPUs) are not designed to handle\
          \ this computation efficiently. The main bottleneck is proof generation,\
          \ which is still too slow and expensive. In terms of timing, zk algorithms\
          \ have been developed for four decades, and zk software engineering for\
          \ about 10 years. The missing ingredient is specialized hardware in order\
          \ to accelerate proof generation, which is needed in order to commoditize\
          \ the technology and make it accessible to everyone.\n\nZK proof generation\
          \ must be an order of magnitude faster than it is today for real world use-cases.\
          \ And that's what we're working on. Most of the demand today comes from\
          \ the blockchain industry for scaling and privacy, but what makes me even\
          \ more excited for zk proofs is the fact that once we get outside of the\
          \ Web3 ecosystem, zk can impact nearly every industry, from medical research\
          \ to AI, to decentralized ID, to new online multiplayer gaming architectures,\
          \ and beyond.”\n\n# 08\\. The Future of ZK Proofs\n\n# 1Seamlessness\n\n\
          The industry is evolving at a rapid pace, with a focus on moving from research\
          \ to a business-led model. On one hand, the near future is focused on addressing\
          \ challenges and roadblocks in this space, which include hardware acceleration\
          \ and faster computation. Here, PL network teams share their top three projections\
          \ for the zk proof space in the near future.\n\nIn the next 2-5 years, Rarify\
          \ Labs expects an era of widespread integration of zk proofs across multiple\
          \ protocols and technologies. Its presence will revolutionize privacy, digital\
          \ identities, and blockchain performance, all while being seamless and mostly\
          \ invisible to users, similar to the way SSL and secure enclaves in phones\
          \ are invisible to users. ZK technology will have a user-centric flow that\
          \ enables scaling and accessibility across the digital identity space.\n\

          \nKitty Horlick, Director, Rarify Labs\n\n“ZK proofs will help dissolve\
          \ the boundaries between Web2 and Web3, particularly within the identity\
          \ space as it is currently the only technology that sits across both realms.\
          \ More generally, zk proofs will massively reduce computation complexity\
          \ and help deliver truly performant blockchains.”\n\n# 2Client side integration\n\
          \nIn the ever-evolving landscape of cryptography, Ingonyama believes zk\
          \ proofs will transcend server-side applications and find their place within\
          \ the very devices we carry in our pockets. Imagine the power of a world\
          \ with zk proof hardware embedded directly in your mobile device, capable\
          \ of running a proof of ownership or proof of personhood.\n\n“We envision\
          \ a future in which zk is not just running on the server side like data\
          \ centers and cloud, but also on the client side – in mobile phones and\
          \ gaming machines. ZK technology is fundamental to trustless compute. We're\
          \ working to make efficient, zk proof hardware accelerators that can run\
          \ everywhere.” said Elan Neiger, marketing lead at Ingonyama.\n\n# Cost\
          \ efficient proofs\n\nAs zk proof methods evolve and proofs themselves become\
          \ smaller in size and more cost effective, they will become an attractive\
          \ option within the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT). Currently, IoT\
          \ devices store all their data in centralized storage and data is stored\
          \ directly onto their servers. ZK proofs allow for proofs to be used in\
          \ place of stored data, creating efficiencies and cutting costs.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/22a3ae6e-5c50-43d0-afca-291f62041cc8/images/9aff3383de21b1456b531420a3159a5518249a442de87a435f9a2a4fde2963ce.jpg)\n\
          \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Another focus for the future\
          \ of zk lies with the Internet of Things (IoT). With zero knowledge, it\
          \ will be possible to cut the costs of data storage, by sending proofs instead\
          \ of data to confirm that specific stages or conditions have been met. Zero-Knowledge\
          \ also allows for yes /  no answers to complex questions involving data\
          \ or sensitive personal information. For example: do you have enough money\
          \ in your bank account to buy this car - Yes or no?  ZK today is still a\
          \ small market, but growing, because it is the most powerful cryptography\
          \ that exists for hiding data, while allowing for assertions on that data.”\n\
          \nEducation and standardization are key to the evolution of zk proofs. To\
          \ that end, Ingonyama launched an open source community effort in August\
          \ 2023: Ingopedia, a repo for all things zk for beginners and experts, ranging\
          \ from video tutorials to academic research (link). Ingopedia has been widely\
          \ cited as a good place to dive into the deep end of zero knowledge.\n\n\
          # Potential Disruptors\n\nAs the industry evolves, researchers and developers\
          \ are keeping an eye out for potential disruptors. These include quantum\
          \ computers, homomorphic encryption and interdisciplinary innovations:\n\
          \n# 1Quantum Computing\n\nIf large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers\
          \ become a reality, they could potentially break certain cryptographic primitives\
          \ that underpin zk proofs. However, should quantum computing become a reality,\
          \ we will have to change all the deployed cryptographic schemes. There is\
          \ already great progress with quantum-resistant encryption to date and industry\
          \ leaders are making strides with quantum resistant SNARKs as well.\n\n\
          Rosario Gennaro, Professor at The City University of New York\n\n“All is\
          \ not lost with the advent of quantum computing. In the future, we will\
          \ see quantum resistant SNARKs. We know how to do quantum resistant encryption\
          \ at this point. Should a quantum computer show up tomorrow, it will change\
          \ everything. It won’t happen overnight, but we'll get there.”\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/22a3ae6e-5c50-43d0-afca-291f62041cc8/images/983de6d97fe9c2c49af38b307b680e4a4235924a6f268d216ab0a1dada2ea027.jpg)\n\
          \n# 2Homomorphic Encryption\n\nFully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows\
          \ computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt\
          \ it. FHE and zk proofs serve different roles in cryptography, and their\
          \ use cases often complement each other rather than disrupt each other.\
          \ While FHE can be used for secure computation and privacy-preserving data\
          \ analysis, zk proofs are typically employed for proving statements about\
          \ data or knowledge without revealing that data or knowledge. However, if\
          \ zk proofs over FHE computations were deployed, it could enable a new level\
          \ of privacy-preserving computation, where not only the data, but also the\
          \ operations performed on the data remain hidden. This would have significant\
          \ implications for secure cloud computing, private data analysis, and more.\n\
          \nActively building in this space, PL network team Zama is building an open\
          \ source framework that enables developers to use homomorphic encryption\
          \ to secure their Web2 and Web3 apps, without having to know cryptography.\
          \ The homomorphic programs can then be deployed locally, to the cloud or\
          \ to their upcoming decentralized infrastructure.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/22a3ae6e-5c50-43d0-afca-291f62041cc8/images/98fdf9e11e6ad299d5f85c1ec009ce7878ab8177d0a8632d2432904bf17881b4.jpg)\n\
          \nRand Hindi, co-founder of Zama\n\n“While zk’s strength is in verifiability,\
          \ FHE focuses on privacy. When you combine the two together, you have the\
          \ ideal solution, because you can have confidential computing that is actually\
          \ verified. And so it's an area we’re very excited about. But zk has difficulty\
          \ scaling existing tech. The way you implement zk is complicated, you have\
          \ to resort to incredibly complex protocols. By contrast, FHE is just a\
          \ smart contract running on-chain, like every other smart contract. But\
          \ again, FHE cannot do what zk does, which is to prove that a computation\
          \ is correct. This is why the future will likely see compatibility between\
          \ the two, with zk for verifiability and FHE for privacy.”\n\n# 3Interdisciplinary\
          \ Innovations\n\nAs the adoption of zk proofs expands, experts from various\
          \ fields may come together to create novel applications and protocols. For\
          \ example, collaborations between cryptographers, blockchain developers,\
          \ AI researchers, and economists could lead to innovative solutions that\
          \ we can't foresee yet. This cross-pollination of ideas might result in\
          \ entirely new use cases and disruptive applications for zk proofs.\n\n\

          \nHarry Grieve, Co-Founder of Gensyn “Platforms will mature to the point\
          \ where they’re ready for production use and then (hopefully) many applications\
          \ will start appearing beyond the current under-the-hood/ scalability systems\
          \ like zkEVMs or the current iteration of Starknet. We’re most excited about\
          \ the applications in machine learning.”\n\nRecommendations & Advice\n\n\
          # Stay Updated with Research\n\nZero knowledge proofs is an evolving field\
          \ with constant advancements. Stay updated with the latest research papers,\
          \ conferences, and discussions in cryptography and related domains to remain\
          \ informed about new techniques and developments.\n\n# Experiment and Prototype\n\
          \nStart by experimenting with existing zk proof libraries and tools. Creating\
          \ prototypes will give you hands-on experience and help you grasp the practical\
          \ aspects of using zk proofs. Collaborate with other researchers, developers,\
          \ and experts in the field. It's a great way to learn the strengths and\
          \ limitations of different zk proof systems.\n\n# Focus on Real-World Applications\n\
          \nWhile theoretical research is important, also consider practical applications.\
          \ Think about how zk proofs can solve real-world problems like privacy-preserving\
          \ data sharing, secure authentication, or improving blockchain scalability.\n\
          \nNicola Greco, research scientist, CryptoNet\n\n“After many years, we finally\
          \ have efficient proof schemes. By efficient, I mean that the prover time\
          \ versus the normal computation time is getting closer and closer. The closer\
          \ we get, the more we can have more applications that can be verified. In\
          \ 2023, it's close enough to verify blockchain transactions. And maybe in\
          \ the future, it can be closer to verify any computation.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\

          Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology is rapidly evolving, and its impact
          is being felt across various industries. This technology is crucial for
          enhancing privacy, scalability, and security in numerous applications, particularly
          those built on blockchain that handle personal or sensitive data, such as
          in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and finance.

          ## What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)?


          Imagine you have a secret and want to prove to someone that you know it
          without revealing it. Zero-knowledge proofs allow just that: proving something
          is true without sharing the details. For example, you could attend a football
          game without revealing your membership card''s personal details or verify
          you have sufficient funds without disclosing your exact bank balance. ZKPs
          enable privacy while providing proof of validity.


          Technically, ZKPs are cryptographic tools that allow verification of information''s
          truthfulness without revealing the information itself. This is incredibly
          useful in blockchain networks, where extensive information is typically
          shared to confirm transactions. With ZKPs, that information can remain private.


          Blockchain is evolving from traceability and full transparency to privacy
          with proof of truth. The key distinction is \*proof of validity\*. This
          marks a revolution in blockchain''s original concept and operating model—what
          some call Blockchain 2.0.


          This technological enhancement impacts the following:


          Scalability in Blockchain: ZKP technology improves speed and reduces costs.
          Instead of processing each transaction individually, multiple transactions
          are grouped and verified simultaneously. This is achieved through zero-knowledge
          rollups, enabling efficient off-chain verifications, with only compact results
          updating the main chain. This reduces congestion and transaction costs.


          Security in Supply Chains: Companies in sectors like logistics need to ensure
          product authenticity and quality without revealing sensitive information.
          ZKPs allow verification of critical supply chain data, such as a product''s
          origin or status, without exposing confidential details. For example, a
          company can prove a food item complies with regulations without sharing
          its entire production process, improving transparency and trust without
          compromising security or revealing proprietary details.


          Biometrics: In biometric security, protecting personal data is paramount.
          ZKP technology allows authentication using biometric data without storing
          the original information. Systems can generate cryptographic keys from facial
          features, enabling identity verification without risking data theft or misuse.


          Digital Identity and Verification: In identification systems, verifying
          a digital user''s identity is crucial. ZKPs allow verification that a vote
          is valid without revealing who cast it or their choice, protecting voter
          confidentiality while ensuring integrity. It’s like depositing a vote in
          a transparent ballot box that correctly counts the votes without showing
          how the ballot sheet was marked.


          Digital Finance: ZKPs enable secure and confidential financial transactions
          while reducing costs, crucial in a heavily regulated ecosystem.


          ## Challenges Facing ZKP Technology


          ZKPs faces several challenges hindering widespread adoption: First, generating
          and verifying proofs requires substantial computing power—it''s like your
          computer constantly solving very complex puzzles, which can be slow and
          expensive. Second, many are unaware of the technology and its potential
          benefits—it’s like having a very useful tool hidden in a drawer because
          no one knows what it''s for. Finally, interoperability between different
          blockchains is challenging due to varying specifications and protocols,
          making it difficult to integrate ZKP solutions uniformly.


          ## Future Trends


          ZKP technology is poised to integrate with other emerging technologies:


          Integration with Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI): Combining ZKPs
          with decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) could create privacy-respecting
          intelligent systems. Imagine a health app providing personalized advice
          without accessing your specific medical data—only whether you''re within
          certain ranges or conditions.


          Security Against Quantum Computers: Quantum computers are extremely powerful
          machines that, in the future, could crack many of the security systems we
          use today. ZKPs are being developed to resist potential attacks from future
          quantum computers, ensuring long-term information security. Think of it
          as a super-advanced lock that even the most sophisticated tools cannot open.
          This ensures that your information will remain secure, even when technology
          advances significantly.


          Mobile Devices with Web3 Technology: Mobile phones that use Web3 and ZKP
          technology will enable more private and secure applications. Imagine using
          a banking app on your phone that conducts transactions without sharing your
          personal data. Thanks to ZKP, these apps can operate securely on blockchain
          networks, protecting your information and making it inaccessible to unauthorized
          third parties.


          ## Conclusion


          Zero-Knowledge Proofs are revolutionizing online privacy and security –
          allowing something to be proven without revealing a secret or detailed personal
          information. This is a game changer particularly in regulated industries
          where breaches can result in significant fines and compensation.


          While challenges remain, advancements are making ZKPs more practical. This
          technology promises more secure and private systems for everyone, regardless
          of technical expertise.

          # Solving An Open Problem in Zero-Knowledge Proofs   Established an approach
          for zero-knowledge arguments that do not leak secret information even if
          randomness is reused during proof generation


          News Highlights:


          1. ◆For the first time in the world, we have proved that the use of witness
          encryption1 is indispensable for the construction of highly secure zero-knowledge
          proofs2 called the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument3,4.

          2. ◆This achievement contributes to the practical application of zero-knowledge
          proof, which is expected to be used in various fields such as finance, medical
          care, and healthcare, as one of the IOWN PETs5 aiming for "a world without
          plaintext."


          TOKYO - September 19, 2024 - NTT Corporation (Headquarters: Chiyoda Ward,
          Tokyo; Representative Member of the Board and President: Akira Shimada;
          hereinafter "NTT") has proved for the first time in the world that the use
          of witness encryption is essentially indispensable for the construction
          of the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument, which is a zero-knowledge
          proof with high security. Zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol
          that proves the validity of a statement without revealing additional information
          to the other party. As an example, this revolutionary technology can prove
          the knowledge of the correct password without disclosing the password. This
          achievement established a construction approach for the resettable statistical
          zero-knowledge argument, thereby greatly contributing to the practical application
          of zero-knowledge proofs, which are expected to be used in various fields
          such as finance, medical care, and healthcare in the future. This achievement
          was presented at the 44th Annual International Cryptology Conference (Crypto
          2024), the premier international conference on cryptology.


          ### 1\. Background


          Zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol that proves the validity
          of a statement without disclosing any additional information. For example,
          it can be used as an authentication technology to prove the knowledge of
          the correct password without disclosing the password. It is also a revolutionary
          technology from the viewpoint of privacy protection because it enables age
          verification without presenting personal information to the other party
          (Figure 1). In recent years, it has attracted attention because it has also
          been used in cryptocurrencies to prove that transactions were executed correctly
          while keeping the contents of transactions secret.


          Resettable statistical zero-knowledge arguments are highly secure zero-knowledge
          proofs and known to be constructed using a cryptographic primitive called
          witness encryption. However, it has been an open question whether resettable
          statistical zero-knowledge arguments can be constructed without witness
          encryption.

          ### 2\. Results and technical points of this research


          This time, we solved the open problem by proving that it is impossible to
          construct a resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument without using
          witness encryption. Specifically, we have shown that witness encryption
          can be constructed by using a resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument,
          thereby showing that constructing a resettable statistical zero-knowledge
          argument is equivalent to constructing witness encryption (Figure 2).


          As a technical point, in this research, instead of directly using the security
          of the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument to construct witness
          encryption, we used it indirectly and constructed witness encryption from
          the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument by the following two
          steps.


          1. First, we show that a resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument
          always satisfies certain properties because of its high security.

          2. Next, we show that witness encryption can be realized by using this property.


          Specifically, we first focus on the fact that the high security of the resettable
          statistical zero-knowledge argument places significant constraints on the
          messages sent by the prover, and show that in certain cases the messages
          sent by the prover must be determined only by the randomness used by the
          prover, independent of the secret information held by the prover. Next,
          we focus on the fact that this property can be used to realize witness encryption
          relatively easily, thereby constructing witness encryption from a resettable
          statistical zero-knowledge argument (Figure 3).

          3 Technical Points of this Study


          ### 3．Outlook


          We will continue to promote the R&D of zero-knowledge proofs as a technology
          of IOWN PETs, with the aim of achieving the goal of the "world without plaintext,"
          where safe data distribution is enabled by the technical guarantee that
          data will be used only within the scope of the data owner''s policy during
          the entire period from creation to destruction. In the future, we aim to
          utilize this technology for our LLM tsuzumi''s secure learning and to put
          it into practical use for IOWN PETs.


          ### \[Glossary\]


          1.Witness encryption


          Witness encryption is an encryption scheme proposed as a generalization
          of public-key encryption. In normal public-key encryption, encryption is
          performed with a public key and decryption is performed with the corresponding
          private key, but in witness encryption, encryption is performed with an
          arbitrary NP instance (e.g., mathematical theorems) and decryption is performed
          with the corresponding witness (e.g., proof of a theorem).


          2.Zero-knowledge proof


          Zero-knowledge proof is a cryptographic protocol between two parties called
          a prover and a verifier. Broadly speaking, in a zero-knowledge proof, the
          prover tries to convince the verifier of the correctness of a statement
          in the following way: At the start of a proof, both the prover and the verifier
          have the statement to be proved as public information, and the prover has
          the evidence that the statement holds as secret information. (The evidence
          is called "witness.") Then, the prover proves that the statement is true
          by conducting a question-and-answer type interaction in which the prover
          answers the question by the verifier, and the verifier verifies the proof
          by checking the content of the response by the prover. Zero-knowledge proofs
          provide three security guarantees: completeness (a prover with appropriate
          evidence can prove a true statement), soundness (a malicious prover cannot
          prove a false statement), and zero-knowledge (a malicious verifier cannot
          learn information on the evidence beyond the validity of the statement).


          3.Statistical zero-knowledge argument


          Zero-knowledge proofs are classified into computational and statistical
          depending on what kind of computing power an adversary has in the definition
          of zero-knowledge, and also into proof and argument depending on what kind
          of computing power an adversary has in the definition of soundness. In the
          case of statistical zero-knowledge arguments, zero-knowledge is guaranteed
          against an adversary with unbounded computing power while soundness is guaranteed
          only against an adversary with realistically bounded computing power (specifically,
          what is called a polynomial-time adversary).


          4.Resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument


          The resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument is a statistical zero-knowledge
          argument that guarantees zero-knowledge even when multiple proofs are generated
          using the same randomness. Using randomness is essential for many cryptographic
          primitives, including zero-knowledge proofs. However, the generation of
          randomness (especially that having sufficiently high quality required for
          cryptographic primitives) requires high-cost operations such as the use
          of physical phenomena. An advantage of the resettable statistical zero-knowledge
          argument is that randomness generation is no longer necessary during proof
          generation. In particular, it guarantees zero-knowledge even if randomness
          is generated in advance and subsequently reused in every proof generation.
          Because of this advantage, the resettable statistical zero-knowledge argument
          can be used even in environments where it is difficult to generate randomness
          because of cost restrictions.

          Our personal data is a new and valuable form of currency. We’ve become progressively
          more comfortable sharing our data with third parties, yet we don’t ask often
          enough what privacy and protection policies they have in place.


          When you book a hotel room, you hand over your passport for the front desk
          agent to scan and copy. When you file a health insurance claim, you submit
          detailed medical records that may reveal sensitive information unrelated
          to the specific claim. Each exchange exposes your personal data to an unknown
          number of people in these organizations. If your information is stored and
          saved, it is vulnerable to theft or data breaches, which are becoming alarmingly
          common.


          PROMOTED


          According to the Identity Theft Resource Center''s [2023 Annual Data Breach
          Report](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2023-annual-data-breach-report-reveals-record-number-of-compromises-72-percent-increase-over-previous-high/
          "https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2023-annual-data-breach-report-reveals-record-number-of-compromises-72-percent-increase-over-previous-high/"),
          there was a 78% surge in data compromises from 2022 to 2023. Healthcare,
          financial services and transportation organizations reported a twofold increase
          in compromises compared to the previous year. In [a 2023 International Association
          of Privacy Professionals report](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf
          "https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf"),
          almost 68% of global consumers said "they are either somewhat or very concerned
          about their online privacy," which "affects how much they trust companies,
          organizations and governments to collect, hold and use their personal data."
          More than 80% of people affected by a data breach said they are inclined
          to end their business relationship with a company after the cyberattack.


          ## The Potential Of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


          A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic technique that [dates back
          to the 1980s](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brief-history-zero-knowledge-proofs-100000129.html
          "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brief-history-zero-knowledge-proofs-100000129.html")
          and now offers immense promise in a wide range of practical applications.
          In simple terms, a zero-knowledge proof allows one party to confirm the
          validity of a piece of information with another party without revealing
          the information itself.


          For example, a ZKP can give you a secure key or certificate to prove to
          a bartender that you are of legal drinking age without showing your ID.
          It can also enable a credit card company to verify your creditworthiness
          without divulging your financial history. Zero-knowledge proofs have enormous
          potential to improve data privacy protocols in ways that benefit both organizations
          and individuals. They relieve organizations of the burden of safely gathering,
          storing and sharing people’s data—and managing the damaging repercussions
          if a breach occurs. And they give individuals enhanced identity and transaction
          verification capabilities that won’t put their personal data at risk.


          Real-world use cases of ZKPs include:


          **• Identity Verification:** Businesses can confirm a customer’s name, age,
          driver’s license or passport number, or other personally identifiable information
          (PII) without copying or storing it.


          **• Financial Services:** Banks and other financial institutions can assess
          a customer’s financial health or enable secure, private transactions without
          revealing sensitive information.


          **• Healthcare:** Providers can validate a patient''s insurance information,
          medical history or eligibility for specific treatments without disclosing
          PII.


          • **Voting Systems:** Voters can prove that they are eligible to vote and
          that their vote was counted while maintaining the privacy of their choices.


          • **Supply Chain Management:** Companies can authenticate products without
          revealing proprietary information.


          ## Overcoming Challenges In Implementing Zero-Knowledge Proofs


          While consumers and business leaders alike are showing a growing interest
          in tools that offer increased data privacy protections, implementing zero-knowledge
          proofs will require overcoming key hurdles. ZKP technology requires substantial
          computational power, which can be costly and resource-intensive for organizations
          to implement. There is a shortage of expertise in this emerging field of
          cryptography, making it challenging for businesses to find skilled professionals
          to develop and implement zero-knowledge proof systems. Integrating and scaling
          ZKP technology within organizations’ existing infrastructure and processes
          may also pose technical challenges that slow widespread adoption.


          I believe that in the next few years, we will begin to see a significant
          shift in our collective mindset about divulging our personal information.
          As zero-knowledge proof technology continues to advance and become more
          affordable, we will see a rapid uptake in adoption. In five or ten years''
          time, we could see changes such as the emergence of tokenized identities,
          eliminating the need to share actual ID numbers or documents, and a significant
          decrease in identity theft as sensitive data becomes less vulnerable to
          breaches.


          But we have to start changing our outlook and our actions now to prepare
          for this future. I recommend the following actions:


          ### 1\. Advocate For Government Implementation


          Government agencies are responsible for issuing and verifying valid identification
          documents, so making change at the governmental level is an important starting
          point. Push for agencies to invest in zero-knowledge proof systems that
          will drive broader adoption and standardization.


          ### 2\. Start With High-Value, Low-Complexity Use Cases


          For business applications, begin implementing ZKPs in areas that offer clear
          benefits and have manageable complexity, such as identity verification or
          regulatory compliance. Experiment with small projects, and learn and iterate
          as you expand into larger initiatives.


          ### 3\. Leverage Open-Source Frameworks


          Technology can advance far more quickly in an environment of collaboration.
          Utilize existing open-source zero-knowledge proof frameworks to accelerate
          development, reduce costs, share lessons learned and benefit from community-tested
          solutions.


          ### 4\. Invest In Education And Training


          A few years ago, "prompt engineer" was not a common job title. Now, with
          the explosion of generative AI, it''s an important role for many companies.
          Be proactive about investing in educating and training your team in the
          skills of the future, including in cryptography and zero-knowledge proof
          technology.


          Zero-knowledge proofs offer a powerful tool for safeguarding data privacy
          in a digital world. As the technology continues to advance, it will likely
          play a crucial role in guaranteeing permissions across various business
          use cases and protecting individuals'' privacy rights. If you understand
          the value of this technology and explore opportunities to leverage it effectively,
          your business will be ideally positioned to improve its security posture
          and build trust with your customers.

          ## [\#](https://www.protocol.ai/blog/zero-knowledge-proofs/\#introduction)
          Introduction


          In today''s digital landscape fraught with data breaches, privacy concerns
          and online vulnerabilities, establishing trust has never been more critical.
          Zero-knowledge proofs (zk proofs) offer an innovative approach that allows
          the verification of sensitive information without revealing the information
          itself. These cryptographic primitives present an elegant and cutting-edge
          solution to true data confidentiality.


          This report includes access to exclusive research and expert commentary
          on the properties of zk proofs, use cases, challenges, potential disruptors,
          signs of momentum and future outlook.

          The Inflection Point


          The primary focus of our research is on the transition of the zk proof landscape
          from research initiatives to serious business. Leading experts assert that
          zk proofs hold the potential to disrupt a wide array of industries, including
          finance, healthcare, luxury fashion, and decentralized systems like blockchain,
          ushering in a new era characterized by enhanced security and confidence.


          [Independent research(opens new window)](https://aligned.co/blog/10-billion-revenue-market-size-by-2030)
          indicates that zk proof generation is set to grow to a $10 billion market
          by the year 2030. The forecast for 2030 anticipates a staggering demand
          for nearly 90 billion zk proofs to power Web3 services, with an industry-wide
          capability to execute 83,000 transactions per second.


          Companies like [Lurk Lab(opens new window)](https://www.plnetwork.io/directory/teams/cldvnvhvz00svu21k086wny3b),
          a team in the PL network, zero in on the complex mathematical models that
          form the basis of zk proofs. They believe the zk proof space is poised for
          growth:


          _“There’s been a decade of work to improve zk protocols that are leading
          to real business – we’re even seeing boutique venture capital firms that
          exclusively invest in this space. We are at an inflection point of better
          technology and more capital moving towards zk proofs. It’s a Cambrian explosion.”_


          – [John Burnham(opens new window)](https://www.plnetwork.io/directory/members/cldvonh480a49u21kw4pf1x9m),
          co-founder of [Lurk Lab(opens new window)](https://www.plnetwork.io/directory/teams/cldvnvhvz00svu21k086wny3b).


          ## [\#](https://www.protocol.ai/blog/zero-knowledge-proofs/\#what-are-zk-proofs)
          What are ZK Proofs?


          Simply put, zk proofs represent a revolutionary cryptographic concept, allowing
          one party to verify the truth of a statement to another party without disclosing
          any specific information.


          Imagine you''re browsing properties in an upscale neighborhood and come
          across your dream home. You want to inquire about its price without revealing
          your entire financial situation. Here''s where zk proofs come into play.
          With a zk proof, you can confirm your ability to make a down payment without
          exposing your complete bank balance. This empowers you to safeguard your
          financial privacy while enabling secure transactions, identity verification
          without revealing sensitive data, and enhancing digital privacy.


          In cryptography, a zero-knowledge password proof is another type of zk proof
          that allows one party to prove to another party that it knows the value
          of a password, without revealing anything other than the fact that it knows
          the password to the verifier.


          **Versatile Use Cases**


          ZK proofs find applications in diverse domains, including banking, healthcare,
          energy and politics. They facilitate secure transactions and confidential
          data sharing, redefining how authentication and confidentiality are achieved
          in digital interactions. Here are five real-world examples:


          - **Cryptocurrencies:** [Zcash(opens new window)](https://z.cash/) may be
          the most notable cryptocurrency dedicated to preserving privacy – and zk
          proofs play a crucial role. They enable confidential transactions where
          the sender, receiver, and transaction amount are hidden, while still ensuring
          the validity of transactions. ZK proofs can also verify the correctness
          of smart contracts without revealing the underlying data.

          - **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** ZK proofs are used to validate transactions
          and operations off-chain, while providing cryptographic proof of their correctness
          on-chain. This reduces the computational load on the blockchain and speeds
          up transaction processing. ZK proofs can also be used in decentralized exchanges
          to prove that users possess the necessary funds for trading without disclosing
          their exact balances.

          - **Supply Chain Transparency:** ZK proofs can be used to verify and authenticate
          the origin, movement, and authenticity of products within a supply chain
          without revealing sensitive proprietary information. This can enhance transparency
          by allowing different entities to independently verify the accuracy of claims
          made about products, such as their source, quality, and journey through
          the supply chain.

          - **Environmental Standards:** ZK proofs can be applied to verify compliance
          with environmental standards without revealing sensitive business data.
          For instance, companies can demonstrate that they meet certain emissions
          reduction targets without sharing specific emission levels or proprietary
          information.

          - **Healthcare Data Security:** ZK proofs can also be used for sending the
          results of a medical diagnosis without revealing the patient''s medical
          records to any third party. This could help to protect the patient''s privacy
          while ensuring that they receive accurate care.

          - **Voting Systems:** In a zk proof-based voting system, voters can prove
          that their vote is valid without revealing the actual choice they made.
          This maintains the secrecy of individual votes, while ensuring that the
          total count is accurate. ZK proofs can be used to verify properties of the
          election process, such as the absence of double voting or the integrity
          of the tally, without revealing specific voter information.

          Rarimo focuses on the identity space, which is one of the most mature and
          promising markets for zk proofs:


          _“The zk proof market is highly promising and already moving towards tangible
          use cases. Identities are at the heart of the rapidly expanding decentralized
          social layer, including decentralized social media, DAOs, reputation systems,
          and on-chain gaming. Moreover, the use of zk proofs is accelerating due
          to the urgency with which identity credentials are needed both within Web3
          and Web2 as AI-generated bots and deep-fakes make it increasingly difficult
          to discern humans – and human-generated content – from machines and AI-generated
          content._”

          4 Exciting Bets in ZK Proofs


          The zk proof landscape is dynamic and poised to revolutionize multiple industries.
          In the evolving landscape of zk proof technology, there are several projects
          and cutting-edge techniques that are pushing the boundaries of what''s possible,
          with a primary focus on enhancing efficiency, scalability, and usability:


          1. [zkEVM(opens new window)](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-zkevm):
          Promoting integration with Ethereum for wider adoption, zkEVM is a concept
          within the Ethereum ecosystem aimed at developing a zk proof system that
          is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).  This would allow
          zk proofs to be used for a wide variety of Ethereum applications. After
          raising $200 million in Nov 2022, [Matter Labs(opens new window)](https://blockworks.co/news/matter-labs-rebrands-zkevm)
          launched their zkEVM mainnet, [zkSync Era(opens new window)](https://zksync.io/),
          in Feb 2023 – an important development in the industry.


          2. [zkSync(opens new window)](https://zksync.io/): A zkSync is defined as
          a method and project focused on developing [zk rollups(opens new window)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#:~:text=ZK%2Drollups%20are%20%22hybrid%20scaling,update%20to%20the%20rollup''s%20state.),
          a type of Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. ZK rollups use zk proofs
          to bundle multiple transactions together, verify them off-chain, and then
          submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This significantly reduces
          the computational load on the Ethereum network and enhances its scalability.


          3. [zk-STARKs(opens new window)](https://starkware.co/stark/#:~:text=4-,What%20is%20ZK%2DSTARK%3F,cryptographic%20proofs%20and%20modern%20algebra.):
          Showcasing an evolution in the zk proof landscape, a zk-STARK is a type
          of zk proof system that is even more efficient and scalable than previous
          systems. This could make zk proofs practical for a wider range of applications.


          4. [Recursive zk proofs(opens new window)](https://medium.com/starkware/recursive-starks-78f8dd401025):
          A recursive zk proof is a technique that allows for the aggregation of multiple
          proofs into a single proof, drastically reducing the computational overhead
          of verification. This innovation has contributed to improved scalability
          in zk proof systems, making them more efficient for applications with a
          high transaction volume.



          As these projects continue to mature and gain traction, the potential for
          zk proofs to revolutionize industries beyond cryptocurrency becomes increasingly
          evident, offering a promising future where privacy and security are paramount
          in our digital interactions. We will deep dive on each of these projects
          in this report.


          ZK proofs have challenges as well as benefits. [Ingonyama(opens new window)](https://www.plnetwork.io/directory/teams/cldvntfwf007bu21ki6edz0fn)
          solves for hardware limitations by building semi-conductors to accelerate
          zk-SNARKs, a type of zk proof. Here is why Ingonyama stresses the importance
          of privacy in the next iteration of the internet:


          _“Information is the most valuable currency in the world. Every one of us
          is guilty of oversharing online all the time to third parties. If you just
          want to prove your age or address, you upload your ID that contains so much
          extra information: full names, address, country citizenship, etc. This situation
          happens every day in the digital world. This problem can be solved by zk
          proofs, considered the most powerful cryptography that exists today for
          hiding data while proving assertions on the data. ZK proofs are considered
          one of the greatest achievements of cryptography in the last 50 years.”_

          # What is Zero-Knowledge Proof - a hot technology bringing trustworthiness
          to Web3 privacy?


          Recently, "zero-knowledge proof" is attracting attention. In 2019, the World
          Economic Forum announced zero-knowledge proof as one of the five privacy-enhancing
          technologies that bring new value to the financial sector (\*1). Why is
          this idea, invented in the 1980s, receiving attention now? This article
          gives an overview of the technology, examples of its application, and looks
          into its future.

          ## What is Zero-Knowledge Proof?


          Zero-knowledge proof; ZKP is a technology in which a person who wants to
          prove something (Prover; hereafter referred to as P) proves the fact that
          he knows the knowledge without giving any other knowledge to the person
          who wants to verify it (Verifier; hereafter referred to as V).


          As a result, V can only verify the fact that P knows the knowledge without
          obtaining any other knowledge (Figure 1).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img01.png?h=378&iar=0&w=800&rev=6d7d71ac7c564b25984a2df33508640b)


          Figure 1: Concept of Zero-Knowledge Proof



          In the real world, when you want to assert that you hold certain credentials,
          it is common to present evidence to convince the other person that you hold
          the credentials.


          However, when you do so, the other person may be presented with too much
          information about what you want to prove, such as your address or age in
          the evidence. If you cannot trust the other person, you may feel uncomfortable
          giving them too much information. However, if you don''t show them the evidence,
          they are unlikely to trust your claim. How can you convince someone that
          you hold the qualification without giving them extra information?


          The technology to achieve this is zero-knowledge proof. The idea of zero-knowledge
          proof originated in cryptography research in the 1980s (\*2).


          - (\*2) [Goldwasser, S., Micali, S., Rackoff, C.: "The knowledge complexity
          of interactive proof-systems," STOC 1985.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22178)



          The claims that can be proven with zero-knowledge proof are knowledge about
          propositions. A proposition is a verbal expression of a judgment that is
          clearly true or false (\*3).


          - (\*3)

          For example, "2023 is equal to 7×17×17" is a proposition, and it is a true
          fact. "I know the prime factorization of 2023" is knowledge related to the
          stated proposition and is an example of a claim that can be used for zero-knowledge
          proof. On the other hand, "2023 is a large number" is subjective and not
          a proposition. Therefore, the claim that "I know 2023 is a big number" is
          not a subject of zero-knowledge proof.



          In general, a zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties: completeness,
          soundness, and zero-knowledge (Table 1).


          | Nature | Overview |

          | --- | --- |

          | Completeness | If the prover is correct, it will be determined to be correct
          by the verifier |

          | Soundness | If the prover is incorrect, it must be determined to be incorrect
          by the verifier with a high probability |

          | Zero-Knowledge | The verifier cannot obtain any knowledge other than the
          fact that the prover wants to prove |


          Table 1: Requirements for a zero-knowledge proof


          ## Intuitive understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


          Here are two examples to help you understand zero-knowledge proofs intuitively.


          ### 1\. The cave problem


          This explanation was introduced in the paper "How to explain zero-knowledge
          protocols to your children" (\*4).


          - (\*4) [Jean-Jacques Quisquater et al., "How to Explain Zero-Knowledge
          Protocols to Your Children," CRYPTO 1989. (PDF: 227KB)](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mkowalcz/628.pdf)


          Inside the cave is a magic door that opens when you say the password. The
          prover P knows the password and gives it in exchange for money. The door
          is at the far end of the cave shown in Figure 2. There are two paths to
          the door, A and B. The person who knows the password can open the door and
          move from A to B or vice versa.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img02.jpg?h=453&iar=0&w=800&rev=cf4c7228935441d3b38f0fd9442af117)


          Figure 2: The Cave Problem



          V, the verifier, wants to buy the password, but he doubts whether P really
          knows the password and cannot start a transaction. If P can convince V that
          P knows the secret password without telling V the secret password itself,
          V can start a transaction. So, here''s what they are trying to do.


          First, V waits outside the cave. Then P enters the cave, randomly chooses
          either path A or B, and goes to the door (Figure 3).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img03.jpg?h=533&iar=0&w=800&rev=0918e3fa17984bbe8d735ff3c9df3166)


          Figure 3: Prover P''s Random Selection



          Next, V enters the cave, goes to the branching point of the paths, randomly
          chooses A or B in their head, and shouts to P to come out from the chosen
          path (Figure 4).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img04.jpg?h=401&iar=0&w=800&rev=945bfc0651e54daea0b604e2edd6f2a4)


          Figure 4: Verifier V''s Random Selection



          If P knows the password:


          P can use the password to open the door and come out of the designated path,
          whichever way V tells him to go (Figure 5). This means completeness.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img05.jpg?h=466&iar=0&w=800&rev=6088ed6bec1c4fd3a3ac05b15c69a53a)


          Figure 5: The Case that Prover P Knows the Password



          If P does not know the password:


          P can only come out of the path he entered, so the probability of coming
          out of the path chosen by V is 50%. If they repeat this process over and
          over again, it''s almost impossible for P to fool V every time (Figure 6).
          For example, if they try 30 times, the probability that P can fool V is
          about 0.0000001%. This means soundness.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img06.jpg?h=421&iar=0&w=800&rev=db7f0b94506a47679157cddc1b1a33bf)


          Figure 6: The Case that Prover P Does Not Know the Password



          So, if P succeeds on all his attempts, V must be convinced that P knows
          the password. If V tries even more, he can get his chance of being cheated
          as close to 0% as V wants. At this time, V will not gain any knowledge about
          the password. This means zero-knowledge.


          Literally, what P wants to prove has been proved to V with zero-knowledge.


          ### 2\. The Problem of Finding a Seabird


          Professor Amit Sahai of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
          explains the concept of zero-knowledge proof on YouTube to children, teenagers,
          college students, graduate students, and experts in five different difficulty
          levels (\*5). Here is a child-friendly explanations that will help you get
          a sense of the main points.


          - (\*5) [Computer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty,
          WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)


          The professor shows the child a picture. The picture shows a crowd of hundreds
          of penguins. He says, "There is one puffin (a penguin-like seabird), and
          I know where it is, but I don''t want to tell you. Do you believe me? I''m
          going to prove it without revealing its location."


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img07.jpg?h=505&iar=0&w=800&rev=3f05fc0c1f934735a75fbbae8353800f)


          Figure 7: The Problem of Finding a Seabird



          The professor pulls out a piece of black paper several times larger than
          the photo. The paper has a small hole, and the photo is pasted on the back
          of the paper so that the hole matches the position of the puffin. The child
          looks into the hole and says, "I see a puffin". But the child can''t see
          the position of the photo on the back of the paper, so she can''t tell where
          the puffin is in the original photo. "This is an example of a zero-knowledge
          proof," the professor explains (Figure 8).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img08.jpg?h=370&iar=0&w=800&rev=46de5598e3f64c609c0c7fd1a156c661)


          Figure 8: Zero-Knowledge Proof for the Problem of Finding a Seabird



          This exchange satisfies completeness because a professor who knows the location
          of the puffin can always prove it.


          Furthermore, it satisfies soundness because if the professor does not know
          the location of the puffin, the cheating will be exposed with a high probability
          if the child looks into the hole and confirms it.


          Furthermore, it satisfies zero-knowledge because the child cannot obtain
          any knowledge other than the fact that the professor knows the location
          of the puffin.


          ## Social Application Examples


          This paper introduces an application example of zero-knowledge proof to
          society and considers prospects.


          ### 1\. Blockchain Privacy Enhancement


          Blockchain is widely used in society, a representative example being virtual
          currencies. Its transparency is maintained by decentralized management of
          its ledger by all participants in the blockchain. However, due to its high
          transparency, securing user privacy may be a challenge.


          In recent years, zero-knowledge proofs have begun to be used to improve
          blockchain privacy. For example, in the case of cryptocurrencies, methods
          known collectively as zk-SNARK (\*6) and zk-STARK (\*7) have begun to be
          introduced as zero-knowledge proofs to show that the transaction operation
          was indeed performed, without disclosing the transaction contents such as
          the sender, recipient, and remittance amount.


          In addition, zero-knowledge proofs have attracted even more attention because
          they can contribute to speeding up blockchain processing.

          ### 2\. Proof of Income Range


          In November 2017, ING, a major Dutch bank, developed zero-knowledge range
          proofs (ZKRP) (\*8). ZKRP is an application of zero-knowledge proofs. ZKRP
          can prove that a numerical value, such as an amount of money, is within
          a certain range without showing the numerical value to the other party.
          For example, mortgage applicants can prove that their income is within a
          certain range required by loan screening without telling the income itself.


          - (\*8)[ING launches Zero-Knowledge Range Proof solution, a major addition
          to blockchain technology](https://www.ingwb.com/en/insights/distributed-ledger-technology/ing-launches-major-addition-to-blockchain-technology)


          ### 3\. Selective Disclosure of Attribute Information


          The W3C, which standardizes Web technologies, has standardized a data model
          for the concept of verifiable credentials (VC) (\*9). It introduces zero-knowledge
          proof, in which you select your attribute information and prove only that
          the attribute satisfies certain conditions.


          For example, it shows a use case in which you select and prove only the
          information that a university graduate received a degree without revealing
          his or her identity or other unnecessary personal information.


          - (\*9) [W3C Recommendation, Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1, 2022.](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs)



          VC is currently being discussed in the "Trusted Web" initiative led by the
          Cabinet Secretariat of Japan. It shows the expectation of zero-knowledge
          proof as a method to realize selective disclosure of data(\*10).


          - (\*10) [Secretariat of the Headquarters for Digital Market Competition,
          the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan, "Trusted Web White Paper Ver 2.0, Overview"
          August 2022 (PDF: 1.7MB)](https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/digitalmarket/pdf_e/Trusted_Web_White_Paper_ver2.0_Overview.pdf)


          ### 4\. User Authentication


          Currently, ID and password authentication is mainly used for websites of
          various services. However, since the string length of a password is limited
          to a range that can be remembered or managed by the human brain, it is vulnerable
          to brute-force and password-list-type attacks.


          Furthermore, if an attacker takes over the server, not only the password
          itself, but also information useful for guessing the password is leaked,
          which becomes a hint for the attacker, and the password may be leaked in
          the future. If user authentication is implemented with zero-knowledge proof,
          the server can be more secure because no information related to the password
          exists from the beginning.


          As a zero-knowledge proof that can be applied to user authentication, there
          is the Schnorr protocol (\*11). In this method, knowledge about the solution
          of a mathematically difficult problem called the discrete logarithm problem
          is assumed to be information that only the user can know and is authenticated
          with zero-knowledge proof. Compared with the ID and password method, this
          method has not been adopted in the world for many years due to its disadvantages
          such as high communication volume, slow processing speed, and "The size
          of the data to be kept secret is too large for humans to remember."


          - (\*11) [IETF, RFC 8235, Schnorr Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof,
          September 2017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8235)


          In recent years, however, with the spread of technologies such as "faster
          communication networks," "faster processing speeds of servers and terminals,"
          and "memory areas that can be securely stored in smart cards and smartphones,"
          conventional disadvantages are going to be no longer disadvantages.


          ## Prospect


          In recent years, the term "Web3" has attracted attention, and although there
          are various interpretations, its constituent concepts are said to be centered
          on "blockchain," "decentralization" and "decentralized ID." Application
          cases (1) and (2) mentioned above are measures to improve the privacy of
          blockchain, and (3) and (4) are related to decentralization and decentralized
          ID. Therefore, zero-knowledge proof can be said to be "a technology that
          brings trustworthiness to the privacy of Web3."


          In the future, zero-knowledge proof will become an essential technology
          for safe and secure future societies that require a high level of privacy.


          NTT DATA will continue to keep up with the latest trends and accumulate
          and disclose know-hows.

          Zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) technology is rapidly evolving, and its impact
          is being felt across various industries. This technology is crucial for
          enhancing privacy, scalability, and security in numerous applications, particularly
          those built on blockchain that handle personal or sensitive data, such as
          in healthcare, pharmaceuticals, and finance.

          - [Conclusion](https://corporate-blog.global.fujitsu.com/fgb/2024-11-12/01/#a4)


          ## What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)?


          Imagine you have a secret and want to prove to someone that you know it
          without revealing it. Zero-knowledge proofs allow just that: proving something
          is true without sharing the details. For example, you could attend a football
          game without revealing your membership card''s personal details or verify
          you have sufficient funds without disclosing your exact bank balance. ZKPs
          enable privacy while providing proof of validity.


          Technically, ZKPs are cryptographic tools that allow verification of information''s
          truthfulness without revealing the information itself. This is incredibly
          useful in blockchain networks, where extensive information is typically
          shared to confirm transactions. With ZKPs, that information can remain private.


          Blockchain is evolving from traceability and full transparency to privacy
          with proof of truth. The key distinction is \*proof of validity\*. This
          marks a revolution in blockchain''s original concept and operating model—what
          some call Blockchain 2.0.


          This technological enhancement impacts the following:


          Scalability in Blockchain: ZKP technology improves speed and reduces costs.
          Instead of processing each transaction individually, multiple transactions
          are grouped and verified simultaneously. This is achieved through zero-knowledge
          rollups, enabling efficient off-chain verifications, with only compact results
          updating the main chain. This reduces congestion and transaction costs.


          Security in Supply Chains: Companies in sectors like logistics need to ensure
          product authenticity and quality without revealing sensitive information.
          ZKPs allow verification of critical supply chain data, such as a product''s
          origin or status, without exposing confidential details. For example, a
          company can prove a food item complies with regulations without sharing
          its entire production process, improving transparency and trust without
          compromising security or revealing proprietary details.


          Biometrics: In biometric security, protecting personal data is paramount.
          ZKP technology allows authentication using biometric data without storing
          the original information. Systems can generate cryptographic keys from facial
          features, enabling identity verification without risking data theft or misuse.


          Digital Identity and Verification: In identification systems, verifying
          a digital user''s identity is crucial. ZKPs allow verification that a vote
          is valid without revealing who cast it or their choice, protecting voter
          confidentiality while ensuring integrity. It’s like depositing a vote in
          a transparent ballot box that correctly counts the votes without showing
          how the ballot sheet was marked.


          Digital Finance: ZKPs enable secure and confidential financial transactions
          while reducing costs, crucial in a heavily regulated ecosystem.


          ## Challenges Facing ZKP Technology


          ZKPs faces several challenges hindering widespread adoption: First, generating
          and verifying proofs requires substantial computing power—it''s like your
          computer constantly solving very complex puzzles, which can be slow and
          expensive. Second, many are unaware of the technology and its potential
          benefits—it’s like having a very useful tool hidden in a drawer because
          no one knows what it''s for. Finally, interoperability between different
          blockchains is challenging due to varying specifications and protocols,
          making it difficult to integrate ZKP solutions uniformly.


          ## Future Trends


          ZKP technology is poised to integrate with other emerging technologies:


          Integration with Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI): Combining ZKPs
          with decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) could create privacy-respecting
          intelligent systems. Imagine a health app providing personalized advice
          without accessing your specific medical data—only whether you''re within
          certain ranges or conditions.


          Security Against Quantum Computers: Quantum computers are extremely powerful
          machines that, in the future, could crack many of the security systems we
          use today. ZKPs are being developed to resist potential attacks from future
          quantum computers, ensuring long-term information security. Think of it
          as a super-advanced lock that even the most sophisticated tools cannot open.
          This ensures that your information will remain secure, even when technology
          advances significantly.


          Mobile Devices with Web3 Technology: Mobile phones that use Web3 and ZKP
          technology will enable more private and secure applications. Imagine using
          a banking app on your phone that conducts transactions without sharing your
          personal data. Thanks to ZKP, these apps can operate securely on blockchain
          networks, protecting your information and making it inaccessible to unauthorized
          third parties.


          ## Conclusion


          Zero-Knowledge Proofs are revolutionizing online privacy and security –
          allowing something to be proven without revealing a secret or detailed personal
          information. This is a game changer particularly in regulated industries
          where breaches can result in significant fines and compensation.


          While challenges remain, advancements are making ZKPs more practical. This
          technology promises more secure and private systems for everyone, regardless
          of technical expertise.

          \n## Introduction\n\nFrom finance to communications to commerce, the most\
          \ essential things in our lives are increasingly digital, and at a pace\
          \ that only continues to accelerate. This has fostered unprecedented economic\
          \ growth and technological innovations, however our most sensitive and private\
          \ information has necessarily come along for the ride. This puts individuals,\
          \ private organizations, and governments increasingly at risk of becoming\
          \ victims of data breaches and hacks.\n\nSolutions to these problems often\
          \ call for increased know your customer practices (KYC) and reporting. KYC\
          \ is a regulatory and security process where businesses verify the identity\
          \ of their clients to prevent identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering,\
          \ and terrorist financing. While there are benefits to this approach, it\
          \ comes with the risk of sensitive data being distributed to even more parties,\
          \ thus increasing the potential surface area for attack, and further reducing\
          \ individual privacy. In a world where trust in institutions is historically\
          \ low, this can be a hard pill for individuals to swallow. But what if there\
          \ was a solution that allowed individuals, private organizations, and governments\
          \ alike to verify things like identity and financial data with said data\
          \ always remaining encrypted and obfuscated? What if you didn’t have to\
          \ trust because instead, you could verify?\n\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)\
          \ have emerged as a pivotal cryptographic innovation representing a paradigm\
          \ shift replacing the need to trust with the ability to _verify_. This comprehensive\
          \ exploration will shed light on how ZKPs are reshaping privacy and security\
          \ paradigms across various sectors. By the end of this article, policymakers\
          \ will have gained a nuanced understanding of ZKPs' potential to improve\
          \ security while maintaining privacy across a wide range of use cases and\
          \ why they are indispensable in today’s digital ecosystem.\n\n## An Idea\
          \ Ahead of Its Time\n\nFirst described in a [1985 MIT paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf),\
          \ zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have been an idea simmering on the back burner\
          \ of cryptographic research for decades. Although conceptually sound, the\
          \ technology required for large-scale and cost-effective deployment was\
          \ not yet available. However, with recent advancements in computational\
          \ power and the advent of blockchain technology, ZKPs are now coming to\
          \ the forefront.\n\nThe feasibility of ZKP applications now being able to\
          \ be deployed at scale can be attributed primarily to two key developments:\n\
          \n1. **Advancements in Computational Power:** Historically, ZKPs were computationally\
          \ intensive, requiring significant processing power which limited their\
          \ practicality. The exponential growth in computational capabilities, in\
          \ particular, more efficient processors and the widespread availability\
          \ of cloud computing, has made it feasible to perform complex ZKP computations\
          \ quickly and cost-effectively.\n\n2. **Synergies with Blockchain Technology:**\
          \ The cryptographic nature of ZKPs aligns seamlessly with blockchain technologies.\
          \ Blockchain's inherent characteristics of decentralization, immutability,\
          \ and transparency provide a conducive environment for ZKP applications.\
          \ Several blockchain platforms have integrated ZKPs as a core component\
          \ of their technology stack, fostering ready-built platforms for the development\
          \ and deployment of ZKP-based applications.\n\n\nThese technological advancements\
          \ have transformed ZKPs from a theoretical concept into a practical tool,\
          \ unlocking their potential to enhance privacy and security in an increasingly\
          \ digital world.\n\n## How Do Zero-Knowledge Proofs Work?\n\nIn a zero-knowledge\
          \ proof, there are two parties: a prover and a verifier. In this transaction,\
          \ the prover can assure a verifier of the truthfulness of a particular assertion\
          \ regarding a data point without revealing any extra details about the corresponding\
          \ data.\n\nZKPs can be categorized into two types:\n\n- **Interactive**,\
          \ where the prover must engage in the verification process anew for each\
          \ distinct verifier.\n\n- **Non-interactiv** e, where the prover creates\
          \ a universally verifiable proof.\n\n\nThe three key characteristics that\
          \ encapsulate a ZKP are:\n\n- **Completeness**: For any true statement,\
          \ a credible prover can successfully persuade an honest verifier of their\
          \ knowledge about the accurate input.\n\n- **Soundness:** In the case of\
          \ a false statement, no deceitful prover can independently convince an honest\
          \ verifier of their knowledge about the accurate input.\n\n- **Zero-Knowledge**:\
          \ When the statement is true, the verifier gains no additional information\
          \ from the prover beyond the fact that the statement is indeed true.\n\n\
          \nThe math that makes this possible is beyond the scope of this piece, however,\
          \ a simple example can help conceptualize how a ZKP works.\n\nImagine you\
          \ have a \"Where's Waldo?\" book, and you claim to know exactly where Waldo\
          \ is on a particular page. Your friend, however, is skeptical and wants\
          \ proof of your claim. But here's the challenge: you need to prove you know\
          \ where Waldo is without pointing him out directly, thus keeping his location\
          \ a secret.\n\n![A photo in sepia of a crowd with a man wearing glasses\
          \ and a red and white stripped sweater and had in color. ](https://5g.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/fullbleed_image/public/media/uploads/images/8560929002_bd81ba6679_o.jpg)\n\

          \nHere's how you can do it: \"Where's Waldo?\"\n\n1. **The Challenge:**\
          \ You open the \"Where's Waldo?\" book to the page in question and show\
          \ it to your friend.\n\n2. **The Proof Technique:** To prove your knowledge\
          \ without revealing Waldo's location, you take a large piece of cardboard\
          \ with a small hole cut in it.\n\n3. **The Verification:** You place the\
          \ cardboard over the page so that the hole reveals Waldo, but nothing else\
          \ on the page is visible. Your friend can now see Waldo through the hole,\
          \ confirming you know his location.\n\n4. **Maintaining Secrecy:** Despite\
          \ verifying your claim, your friend still doesn't know where on the page\
          \ Waldo is. The rest of the page is covered, keeping the information hidden.\n\
          \n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- **Completeness:** If you truly know where Waldo\
          \ is, you can easily align the hole in the cardboard to reveal him, convincing\
          \ your friend of your knowledge.\n\n- **Soundness:** If you don’t actually\
          \ know where Waldo is, you won’t be able to align the hole correctly, and\
          \ your friend won’t be convinced of your claim.\n\n- **Zero-Knowledge:**\
          \ Despite proving you know Waldo’s location, you haven’t revealed any additional\
          \ information about where on the page Waldo is.\n\n\nThese proofs enable\
          \ one party to prove the validity of a statement to another without revealing\
          \ any underlying information. In an era where data breaches are rampant,\
          \ ZKPs offer hope for secure and private online interactions.\n\n## A Myriad\
          \ of Real-World and Digital-World Applications\n\nZKPs have a wide array\
          \ of applications, each demonstrating their versatility and importance in\
          \ enhancing privacy and security in various digital domains:\n\n### Decentralized\
          \ Identity and Authentication:\n\nZKPs can serve as a foundational technology\
          \ for identity management systems by offering a dual advantage: they enable\
          \ robust identity verification while safeguarding personal information.\
          \ This is particularly relevant in systems built on blockchains, which are\
          \ inherently global and interoperable, facilitating secure international\
          \ information sharing.\n\n- **Offline Applications:** ZKPs can be used in\
          \ everyday situations like confirming age for alcohol purchase or even verifying\
          \ citizenship and non-sanctioned status at international borders. In these\
          \ cases, ZKPs provide proof of specific personal attributes without revealing\
          \ any additional personal information.\n\n- **Online Applications:** The\
          \ decentralized nature of blockchain networks limits traditional KYC practices,\
          \ but ZKPs offer a way for central entities to securely verify user identities.\n\
          \n\nSince it is one of the most impactful applications of ZKPs, the following\
          \ section takes a deep dive into decentralized identity.\n\n### Voting Systems:\n\
          \nZKPs introduce a new paradigm in voting systems, particularly in conjunction\
          \ with distributed ledger technologies. Together, they enable a voting process\
          \ that is both anonymous and verifiable, enhancing the integrity and transparency\
          \ of elections.\n\n- **Identity Verification and Eligibility Checks:** Leveraging\
          \ the decentralized identity solutions discussed earlier, ZKPs can be used\
          \ to verify a voter's identity and their eligibility to vote. This approach\
          \ ensures that only qualified individuals participate in the voting process\
          \ and that no one can vote more than once. Such identity verification acts\
          \ as a gatekeeper to access existing voting systems, upholding the principle\
          \ that every vote counts and should be counted correctly.\n\n- **Anonymous\
          \ Verifiable Voting:** Beyond verifying voter identity, ZKPs can preserve\
          \ the anonymity of the voting process. Voters can confidently validate their\
          \ eligibility and cast their ballots without having to reveal their identities\
          \ or the specifics of their vote. This application of ZKPs allows each vote\
          \ to remain confidential while ensuring the entire voting process is transparent\
          \ and auditable.\n\n- **Auditable Yet Private Voting System:** The integration\
          \ of ZKPs in voting systems is transformative, enhancing both the verification\
          \ mechanism and the voting process itself. By incorporating ZKPs, the system\
          \ not only links each vote to an eligible voter but also maintains voter\
          \ anonymity. This dual capability creates a voting environment that is secure,\
          \ transparent, and respectful of voter privacy. The system can be implemented\
          \ either as an identity check before accessing existing voting platforms\
          \ or as an integral part of a new blockchain-based voting system, embedding\
          \ both identity verification and vote casting within a unified, secure framework.\n\
          \n\n### AI and Machine Learning:\n\n- Privacy Preservation in Data Usage:\n\
          \  - A key challenge in AI and machine learning is accessing large datasets\
          \ for training models without compromising sensitive information contained\
          \ within the data. ZKPs enable the verification of data authenticity and\
          \ integrity for these models while keeping the underlying data elements\
          \ private.\n\n  - The capability to verify information while maintain privacy\
          \ is particularly crucial in industries like healthcare or finance, where\
          \ data confidentiality is paramount. ZKPs allow for the utilization of detailed\
          \ datasets for model training without exposing individual data points, thus\
          \ upholding privacy standards and regulatory compliance.\n- Blockchain Integration\
          \ for Model Accountability:\n  - Combining ZKPs with blockchain technology\
          \ introduces a new level of transparency and accountability in AI and machine\
          \ learning. Blockchain provides an immutable record of transactions which\
          \ enables the tracking of data changes, model updates, and decision-making\
          \ processes when applied to AI models.\n\n  - This integration allows for\
          \ a transparent audit trail of how AI models evolve over time and how data\
          \ influences these models. It addresses concerns around model integrity\
          \ and reliability, ensuring that changes or updates to AI systems are transparent\
          \ and accountable.\n- Enhancing Trust in AI Systems:\n  - By utilizing ZKPs,\
          \ AI and machine learning systems can demonstrate that they function as\
          \ intended without revealing their internal workings or the proprietary\
          \ data they process. This builds trust among users and stakeholders, assuring\
          \ them that the AI systems are not only effective but also respect privacy\
          \ and data security.\n\n  - In scenarios where decisions made by AI systems\
          \ need to be justified or explained, such as in credit scoring or medical\
          \ diagnostics, the combination of ZKPs and blockchain can provide necessary\
          \ assurances about the data and processes used without compromising sensitive\
          \ information.\n- Facilitating Collaborative AI Development:\n  - ZKPs enable\
          \ multiple parties to contribute data to AI models securely and privately.\
          \ This collaborative approach, bolstered by the trust mechanisms of ZKPs\
          \ and blockchain, can accelerate AI innovation by allowing diverse data\
          \ sources to be used collectively, broadening the scope and applicability\
          \ of AI solutions.\n\n### Privacy on Public Blockchains:\n\n- The immutable\
          \ and public nature of data stored on a blockchain is a defining and often\
          \ beneficial feature, this feature can become an issue in transactions that\
          \ require privacy. For more on the challenges and opportunities presented\
          \ by the transparent nature of public blockchains, check out our previous\
          \ [Blockchain Brief on blockchain privacy.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/blockchain-worlds-least-private-diary)\n\
          \  - **Private Transactions:** ZKPs are used in blockchains for privacy-preserving\
          \ transactions that keep details like monetary amounts and participant identities\
          \ private.  ZKPs can keep this information private while verifying that\
          \ users are not participating in illicit activity or transacting with sanctioned\
          \ entities.\n\n  - **Private Exchange and Settlement of Digital Assets:**\
          \ ZKPs ensure the privacy of transactions and participants during the exchange\
          \ of digital tokens, such as equity tokens. This is crucial for both centralized\
          \ and decentralized exchanges, allowing for efficient and private asset\
          \ settlement. As more real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate and high-valuable\
          \ collectibles are tokenized and more transactions involving RWAs are conducted\
          \ on-chain, this efficiency and privacy is paramount.\n\n### Scalable Ethereum\
          \ Layer 2 Rollups:\n\nZKPs, through methods like zero-knowledge rollups\
          \ (ZK-rollups), are highly secure and scalable Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum\
          \ that facilitate faster, more efficient transactions. If you need a refresher\
          \ on the difference between a Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain before we dive\
          \ deeper into the current state of ZK rollups, be sure to check out our\
          \ previous [Blockchain Brief where we break it down.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks)\n\
          \n### Oracle-Enhanced Verifiable Computations:\n\n- In decentralized oracle\
          \ networks, ZKPs can be leveraged for verifiable computations related to\
          \ off-chain data points. [As explained in a previous Blockchain Brief](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/delphi-defi-how-crypto-oracles-are-shaping-future-finance),\
          \ blockchain oracles provide smart contracts with access to external data\
          \ and computation results. Using ZKPs in this context ensures the integrity\
          \ and confidentiality of the data processed by the oracles. Relevant off-chain\
          \ data points include:Financial Data: Verifying stock prices or foreign\
          \ exchange rates for use in smart contracts without revealing sensitive\
          \ market data.\n\n- Supply Chain Information: Confirming the authenticity\
          \ of supply chain events like product manufacturing or shipping status without\
          \ disclosing proprietary details.\n\n- Real-World Events: Maintaining data\
          \ privacy while validating outcomes of real-world events, like sports results\
          \ and election outcomes, that impact contract executions Weather Data: Securely\
          \ integrating weather information for agriculture-related smart contracts\
          \ without full data exposure.\n\n\n### Internet of Things (IoT):\n\n- Securing\
          \ IoT device communications and reducing data transmission through ZKPs\
          \ enhances both privacy and efficiency in interconnected devices.\n\n\n\
          ### Supply Chains:\n\n- ZKPs can authenticate compliance and origin in supply\
          \ chain management without revealing sensitive data, which is crucial for\
          \ businesses that wish to keep supplier information confidential.\n\n\n\
          These diverse applications across sectors underscores the significance of\
          \ ZKPs in addressing privacy and security challenges in the digital age\
          \ by offering robust solutions for secure, private, and efficient digital\
          \ interactions.\n\n## A Deeper Dive into Decentralized Digital Identity\
          \ and Securing Personal Identifiable Information\n\nZero-knowledge proofs\
          \ present a unique solution to address the urgent need for safe and secure\
          \ methods of digital identity verification and storage of personal identifiable\
          \ information (PII). ZPKs minimize the exposure of PII by enabling the verification\
          \ of essential information while keeping other personal details hidden,\
          \ thereby fortifying systems against data breaches and preserving individual\
          \ privacy. This is crucial in scenarios ranging from social media interactions\
          \ to financial transactions.\n\nConsider the routine action of showing an\
          \ ID to purchase alcohol – you inadvertently expose more information than\
          \ necessary.\n\nThe cashier only needs to verify two things: that the id\
          \ is a valid, government issued id and that you are 21 or older. Yet you\
          \ are revealing your full name, home address, birthdate and age, sex, height,\
          \ weight, eye color, and driver’s license number. These pieces of information\
          \ are individually harmless, but when they are used together, there is potential\
          \ for abuse, not to mention a violation of an individual’s right to privacy.\n\
          \nThis scenario is amplified online, where the sharing of social security\
          \ numbers, financial details, and personal activities often leads to privacy\
          \ invasion and increases the risk of cyberattacks. Consider the following\
          \ three examples representing massive misuse and exposure of sensitive user\
          \ data, and how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) could have potentially mitigated\
          \ these incidents:\n\n1\\. Cambridge Analytica Scandal:\n\n- **Real-World\
          \ Incident:** A third-party app, This Is Your Digital Life, allowed unauthorized\
          \ collection of personal data from millions of Facebook users. Cambridge\
          \ Analytica used that data for political advertising, including in the 2016\
          \ U.S. presidential election campaign. This breach raised significant concerns\
          \ about privacy and the influence of social media on politics.\n\n- **ZKP\
          \ Mitigation:** ZKPs could have been used to verify the specific user attributes\
          \ (e.g., age, location, political interests) necessary for academic research\
          \ or targeted advertising without revealing or transferring the underlying\
          \ data. That way, Facebook could confirm specific demographics of its user\
          \ base to third parties without exposing individual user data.\n\n\n2\\\
          .  T-Mobile Data Breaches:\n\n- **Real-World Incident:** Caused by a misconfigured\
          \ API, T-Mobile experienced a data breach that exposed the personal data\
          \ of 37 million customers. The stolen data was used by cybercriminals for\
          \ sophisticated phishing, vishing, and smishing attacks.\n\n- **ZKP Mitigation:**\
          \ ZKPs could have been employed in T-Mobile’s data handling processes to\
          \ validate user identity and credentials without exposing user data. For\
          \ instance, a customer service application could verify that a person is\
          \ a T-Mobile customer and check their plan details without the API accessing\
          \ the full range of personal information stored in the database.\n\n\n3\\\
          . Equifax Data Breach of 2017:\n\n- **Real-World Incident:** This breach,\
          \ one of the largest in U.S. history, compromised the personal information\
          \ of about 147.9 million Americans, as well as millions of British and Canadian\
          \ citizens. Hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers, birth dates,\
          \ addresses, and in some cases, driver's license numbers. The breach was\
          \ deemed \"entirely preventable\" by the House Committee on Oversight.\n\
          \n- **ZKP Mitigation:** If ZKPs had been used, Equifax could have allowed\
          \ third-party services to confirm individuals' creditworthiness or identity\
          \ without accessing detailed personal data like Social Security numbers\
          \ or birth dates. For example, a lender could verify if a person's credit\
          \ score falls within a specific range without Equifax needing to share the\
          \ actual credit report.\n\n\nIn each of these scenarios, ZKPs would have\
          \ offered a way to validate and prove necessary information without exposing\
          \ data, thus significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and misuse\
          \ of personal information. Implementing ZKPs requires rethinking how systems\
          \ interact with personal data and moving towards a model where verification\
          \ is possible without data exposure. The adoption of ZKPs benefits individuals\
          \ whose personal data remains protected and private as well as businesses,\
          \ which can avoid the substantial financial and reputational damage often\
          \ associated with such data breaches. By enhancing data security and integrity,\
          \ ZKPs provide two key benefits: they help in building trust among consumers\
          \ and simultaneously safeguard businesses against the risks and liabilities\
          \ of data mismanagement.\n\n## The Current State of ZK-Rollups\n\nAs noted\
          \ earlier, the two developments that have allowed ZKPs to finally transition\
          \ from academic concept to real world use have been increased power and\
          \ availability of compute and blockchains. While smart contract platforms\
          \ like Solana and Avalanche have seen significant growth in daily active\
          \ users, ecosystem development, and capital inflows in 2023, Ethereum and\
          \ its Layer 2 blockchains remain the dominant smart contract ecosystem.\
          \ As of 1/17/24, Ethereum and its L2 chains have a combined market cap ($322B)\
          \ 1.6X higher than [every other smart contract platform combined](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform)\
          \ and 72% ($78B) of [total value locked](https://defillama.com/chains) (TVL)\
          \ in [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/defi-101-good-bad-and-regulatory).\n\
          \nAs discussed in our previous article, breaking down the difference between\
          \ [L1 and L2 Ethereum](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks),\
          \ L2 blockchains are pivotal in enabling Ethereum to scale. As a quick refresher,\
          \ there are two types of rollups: Optimistic rollups and ZK rollups. While\
          \ ZK rollups are broadly considered the superior technology, the increased\
          \ complexity of ZKP development, higher compute requirements, and layer\
          \ 1 technological limitations have given optimistic rollups a strong first\
          \ mover advantage. The top three optimistic rollups, [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.foundation/),\
          \ [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), and [Base](https://www.base.org/),\
          \ currently hold 81% of the total L2 market share.\n\nThe tide has begun\
          \ to change, as several notable ZK-rollups went live in 2023. As of 2024,\
          \ the development and implementation of ZK-rollups on Ethereum have advanced\
          \ significantly, showing promising growth and innovation in various projects.\n\
          \nYou can find a list of notable Optimistic and ZK-rollups in the previous\
          \ Blockchain Brief, [Understanding Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks).\n\
          \nWhile optimistic rollups collectively represent the majority of L2 activity\
          \ and TVL, ZK-rollups are quickly picking up steam and are expected to overtake\
          \ their optimistic cousins. Notably, over the last 30 days, [zkSync Era](https://zksync.io/)\
          \ has processed more transactions than Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and Ethereum\
          \ Mainnet. Both Arbitrum and Optimism have both stated they expect to transition\
          \ their respective chains to ZK-rollups eventually.\n\nThe key takeaway\
          \ here is that the myriad of real-world use cases enabled by ZKPs requires\
          \ a compatible blockchain. That compatibility now exists with the advent\
          \ of ZK-rollups. This, in conjunction with the upcoming [Dencun upgrade](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/27/ethereums-dencun-upgrade-is-a-step-toward-a-scalable-settlement-layer-goldman-sachs/)\
          \ to Ethereum set to launch in the coming months (currently live on testnet\
          \ as of 1/17/24), which will dramatically decrease transaction costs for\
          \ L2s while bringing enhanced security, will not only allow all of these\
          \ use cases to deploy but also allow them to do so cost-effectively at scale.\n\
          \n## Why Policymakers Should Pay Attention\n\nWe live in an increasingly\
          \ digital world. As individuals, private organizations, and governments\
          \ move more of their interactions online, ever more of our most sensitive\
          \ data is put at risk of data breaches and hacks. At a time when faith in\
          \ public institutions is at an [all time low](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/public-trust-in-government-1958-2023/)\
          \ and global ransomware attacks are predicted to [exceed $265B by 2031](https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-250-billion-usd-by-2031/),\
          \ the need for technologies like ZKPs to restore faith in the integrity\
          \ of elections, bolster online security, and protect an individual's right\
          \ to privacy is abundantly clear.\n\nThere are many applications of ZKPs\
          \ that can help balance privacy, security, and regulatory compliance. This\
          \ is especially relevant in the context of global and interoperable blockchain\
          \ technology, where ZKPs can bolster blockchains ability to enhance the\
          \ resilience and accessibility of critical infrastructure and international\
          \ cooperation.\n\n### Challenges in the US Regulatory Environment\n\nThe\
          \ US’s ambiguous regulatory environment is currently driving blockchain\
          \ and ZKP-based technology development overseas. A lack of clear guidelines\
          \ is causing a brain drain in this sector, with developers and companies\
          \ opting for more predictable and supportive environments in countries like\
          \ Japan, Singapore, and parts of the EU. This regulatory uncertainty is\
          \ particularly impactful in the area of decentralized finance (DeFi), where\
          \ traditional frameworks struggle to adapt to the novel nature of blockchain\
          \ technologies.\n\n### ZKPs: A Potential Solution to DeFi KYC\n\nWithin\
          \ this challenging regulatory landscape, the proposed digital assets tax\
          \ reporting regulations in the bipartisan infrastructure bill have defined\
          \ decentralized entities as brokers. This definition is incompatible with\
          \ the decentralized nature of these entities' protocols, as many lack a\
          \ central entity capable of conducting traditional Know Your Customer (KYC)\
          \ practices. The significant compliance and cost burden for startups could\
          \ drive talent offshore, potentially cutting off US users from innovative\
          \ products. Furthermore, the decentralized structure of these platforms\
          \ allows users bypass front-end data collection and access the backend directly.\n\
          \nZero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) emerge as a feasible solution in this context.\
          \ They enable the verification of essential information and reporting through\
          \ smart contracts, all without the need to store sensitive data. By using\
          \ ZKPs, compliance with regulations can be achieved while maintaining a\
          \ balance between privacy, security, and innovation. This technology not\
          \ only minimizes the risk of spreading sensitive data across multiple parties\
          \ but also alleviates the compliance burden for emerging companies. In turn,\
          \ this fosters a healthier environment for technological advancement in\
          \ the US, particularly in the burgeoning field of DeFi.\n\n## Conclusion:\
          \ A Call to Action for Policymakers\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of\
          \ the digital age, Zero-Knowledge Proofs emerge as a powerful tool in preserving\
          \ privacy while ensuring security. Policymakers face the challenge of fostering\
          \ an environment that supports the growth and application of ZKPs while\
          \ protecting consumer rights and privacy. Regulations should be forward-thinking,\
          \ adaptable, and balanced to encourage innovation in this space. The harmonious\
          \ blend of privacy and security that ZKPs provide is not just a technological\
          \ advancement but a step towards a more secure and equitable digital world.\n\
          \nIn conclusion, the potential of ZKPs is vast and multifaceted. From securing\
          \ online transactions to safeguarding AI and machine learning models, they\
          \ offer a solution that strikes a balance between privacy and security.\
          \ As machine learning continues to evolve and our digital footprints expand,\
          \ the role of ZKPs in protecting our digital identities is critical. It\
          \ is imperative for policymakers to understand these dynamics and create\
          \ a regulatory environment that nurtures innovation, protects consumers,\
          \ and maintains the integrity of the financial system. By embracing the\
          \ possibilities of Zero-Knowledge Proofs, we can pave the way for a more\
          \ secure, private, and equitable digital future.\n\n- [Science and Technology](https://5g.wilsoncenter.org/issue/science-and-technology)\n\

          The Inflection Point


          The primary focus of our research is on the transition of the zk proof landscape
          from research initiatives to serious business. Leading experts assert that
          zk proofs hold the potential to disrupt a wide array of industries, including
          finance, healthcare, luxury fashion, and decentralized systems like blockchain,
          ushering in a new era characterized by enhanced security and confidence.


          [Independent research(opens new window)](https://aligned.co/blog/10-billion-revenue-market-size-by-2030)
          indicates that zk proof generation is set to grow to a $10 billion market
          by the year 2030. The forecast for 2030 anticipates a staggering demand
          for nearly 90 billion zk proofs to power Web3 services, with an industry-wide
          capability to execute 83,000 transactions per second.


          Companies like [Lurk Lab(opens new window)](https://www.plnetwork.io/directory/teams/cldvnvhvz00svu21k086wny3b),
          a team in the PL network, zero in on the complex mathematical models that
          form the basis of zk proofs. They believe the zk proof space is poised for
          growth:


          _“There’s been a decade of work to improve zk protocols that are leading
          to real business – we’re even seeing boutique venture capital firms that
          exclusively invest in this space. We are at an inflection point of better
          technology and more capital moving towards zk proofs. It’s a Cambrian explosion.”_


          – [John Burnham(opens new window)](https://www.plnetwork.io/directory/members/cldvonh480a49u21kw4pf1x9m),
          co-founder of [Lurk Lab(opens new window)](https://www.plnetwork.io/directory/teams/cldvnvhvz00svu21k086wny3b).


          ## [\#](https://www.protocol.ai/blog/zero-knowledge-proofs/\#what-are-zk-proofs)
          What are ZK Proofs?


          Simply put, zk proofs represent a revolutionary cryptographic concept, allowing
          one party to verify the truth of a statement to another party without disclosing
          any specific information.


          Imagine you''re browsing properties in an upscale neighborhood and come
          across your dream home. You want to inquire about its price without revealing
          your entire financial situation. Here''s where zk proofs come into play.
          With a zk proof, you can confirm your ability to make a down payment without
          exposing your complete bank balance. This empowers you to safeguard your
          financial privacy while enabling secure transactions, identity verification
          without revealing sensitive data, and enhancing digital privacy.


          In cryptography, a zero-knowledge password proof is another type of zk proof
          that allows one party to prove to another party that it knows the value
          of a password, without revealing anything other than the fact that it knows
          the password to the verifier.


          **Versatile Use Cases**


          ZK proofs find applications in diverse domains, including banking, healthcare,
          energy and politics. They facilitate secure transactions and confidential
          data sharing, redefining how authentication and confidentiality are achieved
          in digital interactions. Here are five real-world examples:


          - **Cryptocurrencies:** [Zcash(opens new window)](https://z.cash/) may be
          the most notable cryptocurrency dedicated to preserving privacy – and zk
          proofs play a crucial role. They enable confidential transactions where
          the sender, receiver, and transaction amount are hidden, while still ensuring
          the validity of transactions. ZK proofs can also verify the correctness
          of smart contracts without revealing the underlying data.

          - **Decentralized Finance (DeFi):** ZK proofs are used to validate transactions
          and operations off-chain, while providing cryptographic proof of their correctness
          on-chain. This reduces the computational load on the blockchain and speeds
          up transaction processing. ZK proofs can also be used in decentralized exchanges
          to prove that users possess the necessary funds for trading without disclosing
          their exact balances.

          - **Supply Chain Transparency:** ZK proofs can be used to verify and authenticate
          the origin, movement, and authenticity of products within a supply chain
          without revealing sensitive proprietary information. This can enhance transparency
          by allowing different entities to independently verify the accuracy of claims
          made about products, such as their source, quality, and journey through
          the supply chain.

          - **Environmental Standards:** ZK proofs can be applied to verify compliance
          with environmental standards without revealing sensitive business data.
          For instance, companies can demonstrate that they meet certain emissions
          reduction targets without sharing specific emission levels or proprietary
          information.

          - **Healthcare Data Security:** ZK proofs can also be used for sending the
          results of a medical diagnosis without revealing the patient''s medical
          records to any third party. This could help to protect the patient''s privacy
          while ensuring that they receive accurate care.

          - **Voting Systems:** In a zk proof-based voting system, voters can prove
          that their vote is valid without revealing the actual choice they made.
          This maintains the secrecy of individual votes, while ensuring that the
          total count is accurate. ZK proofs can be used to verify properties of the
          election process, such as the absence of double voting or the integrity
          of the tally, without revealing specific voter information.

          Rarimo focuses on the identity space, which is one of the most mature and
          promising markets for zk proofs:


          _“The zk proof market is highly promising and already moving towards tangible
          use cases. Identities are at the heart of the rapidly expanding decentralized
          social layer, including decentralized social media, DAOs, reputation systems,
          and on-chain gaming. Moreover, the use of zk proofs is accelerating due
          to the urgency with which identity credentials are needed both within Web3
          and Web2 as AI-generated bots and deep-fakes make it increasingly difficult
          to discern humans – and human-generated content – from machines and AI-generated
          content._”

          4 Exciting Bets in ZK Proofs


          The zk proof landscape is dynamic and poised to revolutionize multiple industries.
          In the evolving landscape of zk proof technology, there are several projects
          and cutting-edge techniques that are pushing the boundaries of what''s possible,
          with a primary focus on enhancing efficiency, scalability, and usability:


          1. [zkEVM(opens new window)](https://decrypt.co/resources/what-is-zkevm):
          Promoting integration with Ethereum for wider adoption, zkEVM is a concept
          within the Ethereum ecosystem aimed at developing a zk proof system that
          is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).  This would allow
          zk proofs to be used for a wide variety of Ethereum applications. After
          raising $200 million in Nov 2022, [Matter Labs(opens new window)](https://blockworks.co/news/matter-labs-rebrands-zkevm)
          launched their zkEVM mainnet, [zkSync Era(opens new window)](https://zksync.io/),
          in Feb 2023 – an important development in the industry.


          2. [zkSync(opens new window)](https://zksync.io/): A zkSync is defined as
          a method and project focused on developing [zk rollups(opens new window)](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/scaling/zk-rollups/#:~:text=ZK%2Drollups%20are%20%22hybrid%20scaling,update%20to%20the%20rollup''s%20state.),
          a type of Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. ZK rollups use zk proofs
          to bundle multiple transactions together, verify them off-chain, and then
          submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This significantly reduces
          the computational load on the Ethereum network and enhances its scalability.


          3. [zk-STARKs(opens new window)](https://starkware.co/stark/#:~:text=4-,What%20is%20ZK%2DSTARK%3F,cryptographic%20proofs%20and%20modern%20algebra.):
          Showcasing an evolution in the zk proof landscape, a zk-STARK is a type
          of zk proof system that is even more efficient and scalable than previous
          systems. This could make zk proofs practical for a wider range of applications.


          4. [Recursive zk proofs(opens new window)](https://medium.com/starkware/recursive-starks-78f8dd401025):
          A recursive zk proof is a technique that allows for the aggregation of multiple
          proofs into a single proof, drastically reducing the computational overhead
          of verification. This innovation has contributed to improved scalability
          in zk proof systems, making them more efficient for applications with a
          high transaction volume.



          As these projects continue to mature and gain traction, the potential for
          zk proofs to revolutionize industries beyond cryptocurrency becomes increasingly
          evident, offering a promising future where privacy and security are paramount
          in our digital interactions. We will deep dive on each of these projects
          in this report.


          ZK proofs have challenges as well as benefits. [Ingonyama(opens new window)](https://www.plnetwork.io/directory/teams/cldvntfwf007bu21ki6edz0fn)
          solves for hardware limitations by building semi-conductors to accelerate
          zk-SNARKs, a type of zk proof. Here is why Ingonyama stresses the importance
          of privacy in the next iteration of the internet:


          _“Information is the most valuable currency in the world. Every one of us
          is guilty of oversharing online all the time to third parties. If you just
          want to prove your age or address, you upload your ID that contains so much
          extra information: full names, address, country citizenship, etc. This situation
          happens every day in the digital world. This problem can be solved by zk
          proofs, considered the most powerful cryptography that exists today for
          hiding data while proving assertions on the data. ZK proofs are considered
          one of the greatest achievements of cryptography in the last 50 years.”_
