          \nIn the past thread on ZKPs or Zero-Knowledge, we spoke at length about\
          \ what ZKP is all about and how it has revolutionized scaling of the [decentralized](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/)\
          \ ecosystem. In this thread today, we shall look at the projects which have\
          \ been stimulating the adoption of zero-knowledge proof. Though the majority\
          \ of the L2s have preferred optimistic [rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/rollups/)\
          \ because their architecture is quite simple to deploy when compared to\
          \ a ZKP, we shall look at a few projects which have done unparalleled work\
          \ to allow ZKPs to rise with time.\n\n## Top Projects on ZKPs to Drive \
          \ Enterprise Level Adoption of Blockchain\n\n### 1- StarkEx\n\n[Enterprises](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/why-is-private-blockchain-network-suitable-for-enterprise/)\
          \ are desperately vying to deploy the decentralization aspect in their modus-operandi,\
          \ but it is the scalability and secrecy which has hindered adoption. StarkEx,\
          \ a Layer 2 or L2 scaling solution has endeavored to improve scalability\
          \ and privacy of the [blockchains](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/a-detailed-guide-on-blockchain-node-infrastructure)\
          \ through the introduction of SNARKs or zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive\
          \ argument on knowledge.\n\nStarkEx uses lightweight cryptographic hash-functions\
          \ that helps in restoring computational integrity which is pivotal for scaling\
          \ the [blockchain ecosystem](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/quintessential-beginners-guide-to-baas-blockchain-as-a-service). \
          \ For example, suppose if we transcend in time and look at mainstream adoption\
          \ of blockchain where we see [decentralized](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/)\
          \ ATMs competing with TradFi. At such times, the need for computational\
          \ integrity will be felt at the maximum.\n\nBuilding an entire ecosystem\
          \ that ensures computation without the intervention of a third party but\
          \ with the same level of trust requires futuristic computational prowess.\
          \ StartEK has already achieved that through its battle-tested integration\
          \ of ZK-starks that do not require a trusted third party to set up the ZKP\
          \ systems. Hence, it is being widely used by exchanges and [DeFi protocols](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/)\
          \ to scale their ecosystem. At the moment, DiversiFi and DyDx have used\
          \ StarkEx to scale up their operations with minimum gas costs and higher\
          \ scalability.\n\nHowever, the trade-off of StarkEX is the computational\
          \ Integrity bolstering commerce. Though most of the [public blockchains](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/)\
          \ do achieve this; they compromise the scalability and privacy of operations.\n\
          \n### 2- StarkNet\n\nComposability with the Ethereum chain is a pressing\
          \ concern that has obstructed the adoption of ZK technology in business\
          \ operations. Most businesses have trusted the [Ethereum Network](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)\
          \ for its decentralization, security and hack-proof track record. However\
          \ they do have a concern while hosting their operations on the main-chain.\
          \ StarkNet, a general purpose ZKP allows faster deployment of dApps on its\
          \ ecosystem. StarkNet pushes for integrity  of computation through the use\
          \ of level 2 cryptographic proofs and modern Algebra.\n\nOn top of this,\
          \ StarkNet is also providing the same composability level as [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)\
          \ allowing developers to further speed up the development process and come\
          \ up with advanced solutions as and when required. Along with this, StarkNet\
          \ provides true anonymity by not letting the user’s identity be derived\
          \ from public keys and supporting multi-calls or multiple transactions in\
          \ one single call to settle the accounts. Hence it significantly reduces\
          \ flow of data from the off-chain computational layer to the main parent\
          \ chain, which is [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/).\n\
          \n### 3- Miden\n\n[Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)\
          \ has been leading by example when it comes to developing and building ZKP\
          \ projects to make sure that their dream of onboarding the next billion\
          \ users to Ethereum doesn’t go unanswered. For that reason, [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)\
          \ Technologies have directed all the focus towards scaling the Ethereum\
          \ chain. Their $1 billion corpus investment to develop revolutionary ZK\
          \ projects like Miden, Hermes, Zero and Nightfall have already steered their\
          \ ambition towards the right direction.\n\nMiden, which was rolled out in\
          \ 2021 is already making headlines. As a STARK based ZKP, Miden aims to\
          \ provide 1,000 to 2,000 TPS which shall move higher to even 20,000 TPS\
          \ once sharding goes live on [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/).\
          \ Miden will cut dependency on third party validators with ready to deploy\
          \ solutions. At the same time, it will be using lean cryptography which\
          \ would make it resilient to quantum attacks in the near future. The Miden\
          \ Virtual Machine will support arbitrary programs which will eliminate cryptographic\
          \ complexities and allow developers to quickly design and deploy the system.\n\
          \nSuch an upside is decisive for the adoption of ZKP because the narrative\
          \ that floats at present is developing the ZKP solution is complex and commands\
          \ a lot of resources. Through Miden, [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)\
          \ aims to solve that complexity by introducing Solidity compatible EVM [smart-contracts](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/smart-contract-standardization-a-necessity-for-the-large-scale-adoption-of-blockchain/)\
          \ streamlining quick deployment.\n\n### 4- Polygon Zero\n\n[Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)\
          \ Zero is another ambitious project which shall outsmart all other ZKPs\
          \ that are capable of scaling TPS. The Plonky2 recursive SNARK will take\
          \ only 170 milliseconds for generating a recursive proof to the transaction.\
          \ Due to such a feature, ZERO ZKPs will be giving very tough competition\
          \ to its competitors in terms of latency and fees.\n\nThey would be much\
          \ lower since the blobs of data will be created and destroyed in no time\
          \ to free up space and reduce toxic waste  for better  scaling  the Ethereum\
          \ base layer.\n\nAnother trade-off of the Zero ZKP is its ability to run\
          \ solidity codes transpiled into ZK Bytecodes making it compatible with\
          \ the Ethereum ecosystem and ensure quick deployment of the solution.\n\n\
          ### 5- Polygon Hermez\n\nThere’s a new buzzword lately in the crypto scape:\
          \ Zk EVM or Zero Knowledge Ethereum Virtual Machine. Since Hermez has already\
          \ achieved unprecedented feats by becoming the very first decentralized\
          \ ZKP on [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)\
          \ mainnet, Hermez 2.0 is poised to further solidify that claim. Under Hermez\
          \ 1, Polygon has already touched 2,000 TPS, but there’s more room for improvement\
          \ that Hermes 2 will accomplish.\n\nRight at the moment, developers have\
          \ to face real challenges when allowing ZKP to directly communicate with\
          \ the Ethereum mainnet. Or put simply, one has to develop everything from\
          \ scratch which adheres to EVM compatibility. Hermez 1.- ZkEVM will execute\
          \ Ethereum transactions in a fully decentralized and transparent way.\n\n\
          Once this would roll, it would eliminate users and Dapp frictions that happen\
          \ when interacting with ZKPs and the main-layer of [ETH](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/).\
          \ Hermez 2.0 will be using the proof-of-efficiency( P-o-E) because the P-o-D\
          \ or Proof-of-Donation model was vulnerable to attacks at the bootstrapping\
          \ levels. Since if a donating verifier goes rogue, it leads to a delay.\n\
          \nHence the team chose the PoE model since it ensured permissionless opportunity\
          \ to produce the L2 batches and kept the right balance between overall validation\
          \ effort and the value in the network. Furthermore, Hermez 2 also introduces\
          \ zkASM which helps in taking complete control in the development and design\
          \ of the architecture in the manner that the project demands, instead of\
          \ an already cookie cutter approach provided. In this way, new projects\
          \ need not have to struggle since they already have a pre-built infrastructure\
          \ from where they can make adjustments and scale up their operations. These\
          \ aspects make Hermez 2.0 a revolutionary solution for scaling the projects\
          \ while maintaining the same degree of security provided by the Ethereum\
          \ mainchain.\n\n### 6- Polygon Nightfall\n\nAt the moment, Optimistic roll\
          \ ups have been deployed across 75% of [DeFi](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/banking-the-unbanked-defi-promoting-financial-inclusion/);\
          \ but they do struggle with the withdrawal time which is seven days. Polygon’s\
          \ core aim is to give very high grade security and scalability solutions\
          \ to [enterprises](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/8-emerging-enterprise-blockchain-trends-to-follow-in-2022/).\
          \ Hence they came up with Nightfall which will introduce the perfect amalgamation\
          \ of ZKPs and Optimistic roll-ups to impart privacy, scalability and gas\
          \ cost optimization to the users.\n\nThe privacy preserving roll-ups that\
          \ [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)\
          \ has introduced in Nightfall only reveal the time and date of the transaction.\
          \ Whereas, the [optimistic rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/appchains/optimistic-rollups/)\
          \ assume every transaction to be valid; however, it does allow the challenging\
          \ period to validate the authenticity of the transaction. In this way, Polygon,\
          \ through Nightfall, has been instrumental towards empowering SCM or [Supply\
          \ Chain](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/transforming-supply-chain-finance-with-blockchain)\
          \ Management, [NFT](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/dynamic-nfts-new-world-for-nfts)\
          \ markets and blockchain mixers to scale up their operations. Ernst & Young\
          \ E & Y is already in talks with Polygon and they have empowered EY Opschain\
          \ and EY Blockchain Analyser using the Polygon Nightfall ZKPs.\n\n### 7-\
          \ Metis\n\nMetis has been another key driver from the [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)\
          \ family which has been designed in such a way to help optimistic roll-ups\
          \ occupy center stage when it comes to scaling the ETH’s base layer. As\
          \ you can see in the opening of this blog, Vitalik Buterin, the founder\
          \ of [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)\
          \ has been quite favoring ZKPs when compared to [Optimistic rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/appchains/optimistic-rollups/).\n\
          \nHis major concern however  was the withdrawal time for funds since optimistic\
          \ roll-ups take more than 7 days and by that time, the funds are locked\
          \ within the [smart-contract](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/smart-contract-standardization-a-necessity-for-the-large-scale-adoption-of-blockchain/).\
          \ The objective of Metis ZKP is to completely disrupt that model with a\
          \ new noble solution.\n\nIn the new validation model as proposed by the\
          \ Metis ZKP, there will be a multi-party fraud detection system. Due to\
          \ this mechanism, an additional layer of security will be created while\
          \ finalizing the transaction which is called the Metis Ranger System.\n\n\
          Under the Metis Ranger system, the validators/rangers are given specific\
          \ blocks as samples. These rangers first audit the transaction and provide\
          \ validity proofs first-in hand before the mainchain validators can challenge\
          \ the transaction. Due to this process, the validation and withdrawal times\
          \ that took weeks on the layer 1’s or mainchain could be completed in hours\
          \ and minutes to scale up the use of optimistic [rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/rollups/)\
          \ in scaling requirements.\n\n### 8- ZK Sync\n\nWhat’s the biggest challenge\
          \ in the blockchain space? Answering to the blockchain trilemma: (i) Decentralization\
          \ (ii) Security (iii) Scalability. If you deep dive into L1s, all of them\
          \ face the same challenge. Though Algorand claims to have solved the Trilemma,\
          \ yet the claims remain subject to contention since everyone can become\
          \ a validator on PPoS consensus of Algorand but the Round Robin validator\
          \ selection goes to the highest staker.\n\nZKs have solved the scalability\
          \ challenges but their process remains much debatable. For example, most\
          \ of the validators cannot participate in validating the entire transaction\
          \ volume. As a result of this, the problem of censorship, DD-o-S and centralization\
          \ looms larger.\n\nThrough [ZkSync](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-zksync-era-node/),\
          \ a new way of validating the transaction will be made possible.. There\
          \ will be validators and guardians with the validators given the role to\
          \ pack the transaction in batches and they need to submit security bonds\
          \ which are always higher than the txs they validate. In this way, it makes\
          \ the transactions safe. At the same time, to check that validators do not\
          \ go rogue by controlling the network, the guardians who are majority [token](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/comprehensive-guide-on-tokenized-real-world-assets/)\
          \ holders choose the validators in random manner.\n\nThese guardians need\
          \ not have to run the computation on high-end computing devices. They can\
          \ choose to control a fraction of the network with even a basic laptop;\
          \ thus making the process of validation completely decentralized due to\
          \ no entry barrier. On top of this, they are also not eligible for slashing,\
          \ hence more people would join to make the ecosystem completely decentralized.\
          \ That’s how [ZKSyncs](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-zksync-era-node/)\
          \ are functioning to provide true [decentralization](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/),\
          \ security and scalability to the main chains.\n\n### 9- Loopring\n\nLoopring\
          \ has been instrumental towards simplifying trading in cryptocurrencies\
          \ with a complete non-custodial and highly anonymous set-up for traders.\
          \ The project also aims to solve the challenges of liquidity, scalability\
          \ and user experience through the use of ZKP. In the Loopring operational\
          \ mode, in order to scale DEX or [Decentralized](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/)\
          \ Exchanges, Loopring is introducing a hybrid model of ZKP.\n\nIn the Hybrid\
          \ ZKP model offered by Loopring, order-messaging will be handled off-chain,\
          \ whereas, and settlement will happen on-chain on a real-time basis with\
          \ no delays.\n\nLoopring will use the ZKP that will relay information to\
          \ the mainchain by the prover that they have done some computation. The\
          \ Merkle-trees will display the complete transaction history and a smart-contract\
          \ will be checking the same to provide real-time data sets to the mainchain\
          \ for recording transactions.\n\nIn this way, Loopring aims to completely\
          \ revolutionize trading through DEX where the order model will be fast,\
          \ efficient,  economical and completely non-custodial in nature. Along with\
          \ this, Loopring introduces the standalone exchange contracts which will\
          \ make transactions completely secretive providing adequate privacy to the\
          \ users; thus allowing different DEXes to cooperate using the ZKP model\
          \ to exchange information and execute trades. They can do so using the same\
          \ exchange contract which shall stimulate liquidity and faster settlements\
          \ as and when required to scale decentralized exchanges.\n\n### 10- Mina\n\
          \nThough we say that [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)\
          \ and [BItcoin blockchains](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-bitcoin-blockchain/)\
          \ are heavily decentralized, they come with a downside for those who want\
          \ to run the full-nodes. They need to download the complete full node from\
          \ the Genesis Block to the day they wish to run the [full-node](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/what-is-a-full-node-a-detailed-guide/).\
          \ This creates an entry barrier since Bitcoin blockchain has a 437 GB block\
          \ size and Ethereum has 1 TB. Mina ends up as an amenable choice to resolve\
          \ this problem.\n\nIt is the world’s lightest blockchain running a 22KB\
          \ block. To ensure scalability and high throughput, the Mina blockchain\
          \ uses the Ouroboros Samasika consensus mechanism that uses a modified [PoS](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/a-complete-guide-on-proof-of-stake-pos-in-cryptocurrency/)\
          \ model. However, to further scale the ecosystem, Mina uses the SNARK mechanism\
          \ to validate the transactions. However this SNARK is unlike the others\
          \ talked about.\n\nThe SNARK validators open a SnarketPlace. On the Snarketplace,\
          \ they publish the ZK proofs on the Snarketplace and block producers  will\
          \ be bidding for the Snark Proofs. The most competitive bid wins the auction\
          \ and they need to share a part of their block produced rewards with the\
          \ SNARK workers/validators. In this way, the system remains truly decentralized,\
          \ scalable and incentivizing for anyone to enter and exit the system.\n\n\
          Mina has envisaged a new economic model which maintains anonymity, economic\
          \ incentives and even scales the ecosystem through the use of ZKPs.\n\n\
          Stay Tuned since we will be posting more threads that shall cover all other\
          \ nuances of ZKPs and how they will shape the future of blockchain. Follow\

          \n# 01\\. Introduction\n\nIn a digital age rife with data breaches and online\
          \ vulnerabilities, building trust is more crucial than ever. Zero knowledge\
          \ proofs (zk proofs) offer an elegant solution beyond traditional privacy\
          \ measures by allowing one party to verify certain information without ever\
          \ disclosing the information itself.\n\nExperts say zk proofs have the potential\
          \ to revolutionize various industries, from finance and healthcare to luxury\
          \ fashion and decentralized systems like blockchain, ushering in a new era\
          \ of security and assurance. Independent research shows that zk proof generation\
          \ will become a $\\\\mathfrak{s}\\\\i0$ billion market by the year 2030.\
          \ Web3 services will require almost 90 billion zk proofs to be performed\
          \ in 2030, with market-wide completion of 83,000 transactions per second.\
          \ This report will cover some familiar zk proof territory, including the\
          \ differences between zk-STARKs and zkSNARKs, a timeline of innovations\
          \ in this space, challenges and future projections. The focus, however,\
          \ is today’s exciting inflection point where zk proofs are moving from research\
          \ projects to serious business – an analysis derived from new and firsthand\
          \ accounts from leading companies within the ecosystem of $^{250+}$ companies\
          \ that form the Protocol Labs innovation network. With a shared mission\
          \ to shape the future of computing, PL companies — including CryptoNet,\
          \ Gensyn, Ingonyama, Lurk Lab, Polybase, Rarimo, StarkWare, Zama — have\
          \ contributed to the world of zk proofs for years and will share their exclusive\
          \ insights in this report.\n\nCompanies like Lurk Lab zero in on the complex\
          \ mathematical models that form the basis of zk proofs. They believe the\
          \ zk proof space is poised for growth:\n\n“There’s been a decade of work\
          \ to improve zk protocols that are leading to real business – we’re even\
          \ seeing boutique venture capital firms that exclusively invest in this\
          \ space. We are at an inflection point of better technology and more capital\
          \ moving towards zk proofs,\" said John Burnham, cofounder of Lurk Lab.\
          \ \"It’s a Cambrian explosion.”\n\nThis report features exclusive research\
          \ and expert commentary on the properties of zk proofs, use cases, challenges,\
          \ potential disruptors, signs of momentum and future outlook.\n\nIngonyama,\
          \ a PL network team that solves for hardware limitations by building semi-conductors\
          \ to accelerate zkSNARKs, stresses the importance of privacy in the next\
          \ iteration of the internet:\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/b353e417-a88e-4254-a055-753acd3e086f/images/56ff147a935b9d92a3fcdecfc44cadc9fa3fcaef306b761939add29d16821bea.jpg)\n\
          \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Information is the most\
          \ valuable currency in the world. Yet we are all guilty of oversharing our\
          \ data to third parties on the internet. Today if you want to prove one\
          \ aspect of yourself, such as age, you must upload an ID which contains\
          \ so much extra information —  full name, address, country of citizenship,\
          \ etc. What happens to that data? Often we find it's been leaked or stolen.\
          \ This scenario happens every day in the digital world. The problem of oversharing\
          \ can be solved by zk proofs, which are the most powerful cryptography that\
          \ exists today for hiding data, while allowing for assertions on that data.\
          \ ZK proofs are considered one of the greatest achievements of cryptography\
          \ in the last 50 years.”\n\n# 02\\. What are ZeroKnowledge Proofs?\n\nPicture\
          \ this:\n\nYou’re driving in an upscale neighborhood and spot the perfect\
          \ house. You dial the realtor’s number, ready to hear the asking price.\
          \ What if there was a way to prove to the realtor right away that you’re\
          \ good for the money — no matter the cost — without revealing the total\
          \ amount in your bank account? You could maintain your financial privacy\
          \ and put in an offer right away.\n\nHere enters the concept of a zero knowledge\
          \ proof (zk proof). In this scenario, you present a zk proof to confirm\
          \ you have enough funds for the down payment without revealing your entire\
          \ bank balance or personal wealth. By establishing trust without unnecessary\
          \ disclosures, zk proofs find practical application in various daily scenarios\
          \ — ensuring secure digital transactions, verifying identity without exposing\
          \ sensitive data, and revolutionizing privacy in the digital age.\n\nIn\
          \ 1985, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff first introduced\
          \ the concept of zk proofs to the world. Years later, one of their mentees,\
          \ Rosario Gennaro, a researcher and former data scientist at Protocol Labs,\
          \ wrote a highly cited paper about more efficient, publicly verifiable computer\
          \ schemes that is still relied on today. He shares an example of a zk proof\
          \ with a technical explanation here:\n\n# Step by Step Example of a ZK Proof\n\
          \nstep 01.\n\nstep 02.\n\n# Setup\n\nEmily and David agree on the secret\
          \ vault's combination, but they want to ensure that Emily truly knows it\
          \ without exposing it.\n\n# Prover (Emily)\n\nEmily takes on the role of\
          \ the prover. She uses a zk proof technique to demonstrate her knowledge\
          \ of the combination without revealing what it is. Instead of showing the\
          \ combination directly, she performs a series of cryptographic operations\
          \ that prove she possesses the knowledge.\n\n# step 04.\n\nstep 03.\n\n\
          # Proof Generation\n\nEmily follows David's instructions using the knowledge\
          \ she has without revealing the combination itself. She provides the result\
          \ of her operations to David.\n\n# Verifier (David)\n\nDavid is the verifier\
          \ in this scenario. He wants to be convinced that Emily actually knows the\
          \ combination. David challenges Emily by asking her to prove her knowledge.\
          \ He provides specific instructions, such as asking her to perform operations\
          \ on the combination without revealing it.\n\n# step 05.\n\n# Verification\n\
          \nDavid checks Emily's response. If it's correct based on the instructions\
          \ he provided, he becomes convinced that Emily knows the combination without\
          \ actually learning the combination himself. If Emily didn't know the combination,\
          \ it would be highly improbable for her to consistently provide correct\
          \ responses based on David's instructions.\n\nIn this example, the prover\
          \ (Emily) demonstrates her knowledge of the combination to the verifier\
          \ (David) without revealing the actual combination. This showcases the core\
          \ concept of zk proofs, where one party can prove knowledge of certain information\
          \ without disclosing that information to the other party, ensuring privacy\
          \ and security in various applications like authentication and cryptography.\n\

          \n# 2019\n\nThe zk-SNARKs project releases Halo, a new zk-SNARKs system\
          \ that is more efficient and scalable than previous systems.\n\n# 2021\n\
          \nThe Ethereum Foundation announces the launch of the zkEVM project, which\
          \ aims to bring zk proofs to the Ethereum blockchain.\n\n2021\n\nzkSync,\
          \ a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum using zk rollups, gains attention.\n\
          \n2021\n\nCairo, a programming language for zk-SNARKs, is introduced by\
          \ StarkWare, simplifying the development of zk-rollup solutions.\n\n# 2020\n\
          \nA Note on zk-SNARKS vs zk-STARKS\n\nFilecoin mainnet launches as a decentralized\
          \ storage network and cryptocurrency. Filecoin is currently the largest\
          \ deployed zk-SNARK to date. By 2023, the Filecoin network produces 6-7\
          \ million zk-SNARK proofs daily, each proof encompassing over 100 million\
          \ arithmetic constraints.\n\n2022\n\nThe zkSync project releases zkSync\
          \ 2.0, a new zk rollup that is designed to be more efficient and scalable\
          \ than previous zk rollups.\n\nTwo cryptographic techniques, created in\
          \ tandem, fall under the umbrella of zk proofs: zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs.\
          \ Both aim to achieve similar goals of proving the validity of statements\
          \ without revealing the underlying data, but they differ in their underlying\
          \ mechanisms and use cases~\n\nvzk-SNARK is a type of zk proof that allows\
          \ a prover to demonstrate the truth of a statement to a verifier in a succinct\
          \ and non-interactive manner. It's particularly associated with privacy-preserving\
          \ transactions in blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, like Zcash.\x88\
          \ vzk-STARK is another type of zk proof that also allows for proving the\
          \ validity of statements without revealing the underlying data. Though it\
          \ requires interaction, it achieves better security by removing the need\
          \ for trusted setups, unlike zk-SNARKs.\n\nFor details on zk-SNARKS vs zk-STARKS,\
          \ read this piece by PL network team Consensys.\n\n# 04\\. Current Major\
          \ Use Cases\n\nZK proofs have found diverse applications across various\
          \ fields due to their unique ability to verify information without revealing\
          \ the underlying data. Here are five major use cases:\n\n# Voting Systems\n\
          \nIn a zk proof-based voting system, voters can prove that their vote is\
          \ valid without revealing the actual choice they made. This maintains the\
          \ secrecy of individual votes, while ensuring that the total count is accurate.\
          \ Similar to the way they are used today by DAOs, zk proofs can be used\
          \ to verify properties of the election process, such as the absence of double\
          \ voting or the integrity of the tally, without revealing specific voter\
          \ information.\n\n# Cryptocurrencies\n\nZcash may be the most notable cryptocurrency\
          \ dedicated to preserving privacy – and zk proofs play a crucial role. They\
          \ enable confidential transactions where the sender, receiver, and transaction\
          \ amounts are hidden, while still ensuring the validity of transactions.\
          \ ZK proofs can also verify the correctness of smart contracts without revealing\
          \ the underlying data.\n\n# Decentralized Finance (DeFi)\n\nResearch shows\
          \ that the DeFi market is growing rapidly and consistently, nearly doubling\
          \ each year since 2018. According to data, the market is set to reach $\\\
          \\mathbb{567.4}$ billion by 2026. This translates to corresponding growth\
          \ in the zk proof space, as DeFi platforms leverage zk proofs to enhance\
          \ privacy and scalability.\n\nZK proofs are used to validate transactions\
          \ and operations off-chain, while providing cryptographic proof of their\
          \ correctness on-chain. This reduces the computational load on the blockchain\
          \ and speeds up transaction processing. ZK proofs can also be used in decentralized\
          \ exchanges to prove that users possess the necessary funds for trading\
          \ without disclosing their exact balances.\n\nSince 2019, when DeFi was\
          \ relatively new, its quarter-on-quarter growth has risen at a rapid rate,\
          \ with over 6 million unique wallets completing an onchain transaction each\
          \ month since late-2022.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/b353e417-a88e-4254-a055-753acd3e086f/images/7c559b632ab6131d332d3f8eea7f47f8277d096db11dd432fc77de4c79a1dfe6.jpg)\n\
          \nnumber of active defi users\n\n# Supply Chain Transparency and Traceability\n\
          \nZK proofs can be used to verify and authenticate the origin, movement,\
          \ and authenticity of products within a supply chain without revealing sensitive\
          \ proprietary information. This can enhance transparency by allowing different\
          \ entities to independently verify the accuracy of claims made about products,\
          \ such as their source, quality, and journey through the supply chain. For\
          \ example, zk proofs could be employed to prove that a product was ethically\
          \ sourced, without disclosing proprietary supplier data.\n\n# Environmental\
          \ Standards\n\nZK proofs can be applied to verify compliance with environmental\
          \ standards without revealing sensitive business data. For instance, companies\
          \ can demonstrate that they meet certain emissions reduction targets without\

          \ of the PL innovation network, Polybase’s co-founder Sid Gandhi shares\
          \ an example of an energy use case in the real world.\n\n“One of the largest\
          \ European energy companies wants to offer transparent data around renewable\
          \ energy generation. Rather than quarterly manual audits, we look at real\
          \ time data being generated from renewable resources. What percentage of\
          \ the energy generated and sent to this particular client is green? Doing\
          \ that in a cryptographically verifiable way isn't really possible. Consider\
          \ data centers that don't want to reveal second-by-second energy data that\
          \ they are consuming – that can be used for competitive intelligence.\n\n\
          What we allow with zk is the ability to keep that private data private,\
          \ but then prove some public attributes of that data. So we could prove\
          \ points like: what percentage of the data generated at this particular\
          \ time is renewable? That's a very motivating use case for us, because that\
          \ solves a real problem in the real world that we've seen with real customers.\
          \ It's really exciting for us to be able to tackle this problem.”\n\n# 05\\\
          . 4 Exciting Bets in ZK Proofs\n\nIn the evolving landscape of zk proof\

          \ are pushing the boundaries of what's possible, with a primary focus on\
          \ enhancing efficiency, scalability, and usability. These innovative efforts\
          \ are not only shaping the future of zk proofs, but also working towards\
          \ broader adoption across various domains.\n\nAs these projects continue\
          \ to mature and gain traction, the potential for zk proofs to revolutionize\
          \ industries beyond cryptocurrency becomes increasingly evident, offering\
          \ a promising future where privacy and security are paramount in our digital\
          \ interactions.\n\nResearch shows that\n\n6 The zk proof market is projected\
          \ to reach $\\\\mathbb{575}$ million in revenue in 2024,\n\n6 Has the potential\

          \ ecosystem aimed at developing a zk proof system that is compatible with\
          \ the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It involves various stakeholders,\
          \ including developers, researchers, and the Ethereum community. This would\
          \ allow zk proofs to be used for a wide variety of Ethereum applications.\n\
          \n# 2zkSync\n\nA method and project focused on developing zk rollups, a\
          \ type of layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. ZK rollups use zk proofs\
          \ to bundle multiple transactions together, verify them off-chain, and then\
          \ submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This significantly reduces\
          \ the computational load on the Ethereum network and enhances its scalability.\
          \ Examples8\n\n^ zkSync is also the name of a specific project that has\
          \ been developed to implement this method. It is initiated and maintained\
          \ by Matter Labs, a company focused on improving the scalability and usability\
          \ of blockchain networks. The zkSync project includes the development of\
          \ the zkSync protocol, smart contract infrastructure, and associated toolsA\n\
          \n^ Emerging zk rollups, such as zkSync Era, have witnessed a growth in\
          \ their total value locked (TVL) surging to $\\\\mathfrak{s}668$ million\
          \ in June 30, 2023, according to Crypto.com.  This signifies an impressive\

          \ that is even more efficient and scalable than previous systems. This could\
          \ make zk proofs practical for a wider range of applications.\n\n# 4Recursive\
          \ zk proofs\n\nA technique that allows for the aggregation of multiple proofs\
          \ into a single proof, drastically reducing the computational overhead of\
          \ verification. This innovation has contributed to improved scalability\
          \ in zk proof systems, making them more efficient for applications with\
          \ a high transaction volume.  Usually, the way it is used is in evolving\
          \ computation: First, it breaks the computation to be proven into smaller\
          \ steps and proves them iteratively. Each step contains a proof, proving\
          \ the current state of the computation. Then, a new proof for the next step\
          \ can be generated by using the current step and its proof recursively showing\
          \ the correctness of all prior steps alltogether. The proof update does\
          \ not require recomputing from the very first step as in a standard zk proof,\
          \ and it is independent of the total length of the computation.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/b353e417-a88e-4254-a055-753acd3e086f/images/50a077cf990e6a7568d6590328c1d3f1f580cd29ede2dad7a403e04a5f986657.jpg)\n\

          \n# 07\\. Challenges & Hurdles\n\n# 1Computational Complexity\n\nZK proofs\
          \ offer exciting possibilities for privacy, security, and efficiency. However,\
          \ they also come with several technical challenges and adoption barriers\
          \ for researchers, developers, and practitioners working in the realm of\
          \ zk proofs. These multifaceted issues range from efficiency and scalability\
          \ limitations to concerns about security assumptions and real world implications.\
          \ By addressing these challenges, the cryptographic community can pave the\
          \ way for the broader utilization of zk proofs in domains ranging from blockchain\
          \ and cybersecurity to privacypreserving technologies and beyond. Here are\
          \ five challenges currently in focus:\n\nMany zk proof systems involve the\
          \ use of sophisticated cryptographic operations applied to a complex mathematical\
          \ representation of a computer program. This complexity can make it challenging\
          \ for developers to adopt and integrate zk proofs into their applications.\
          \ It also affects the efficiency and scalability of large-scale zk systems.\n\
          \n“The main challenge is around the balance of cost, time and proof size.\
          \ This is the Holy Grail: to generate a proof with zero overhead and super\
          \ small proof size. Now, we have achieved super small proof sizes, but with\
          \ other big trade-offs. Generally the trade-off is: it becomes more expensive.”\n\
          \nNicola Greco, research scientist, CryptoNet\n\n# 2Scalability\n\nWhile\
          \ zk proofs can aggregate multiple proofs and transactions, scalability\
          \ challenges can arise when dealing with a high volume of transactions.\
          \ Generating and verifying a large number of proofs may introduce bottlenecks.\
          \ Achieving strong privacy guarantees through zk proofs might involve trade-offs\
          \ in terms of transaction speed, network overhead, or computational load.\
          \ Striking the right balance between privacy and performance is crucial.\n\
          \nResearch scientist Rosario Gennaro explains that building a zk proof involves\
          \ running a program that stores the state of the virtual machine at every\
          \ step of the proof, making space a bottleneck to growth and speed of transaction.\
          \ Folding schemes present a solution for proofs that are computed at every\
          \ step of a computation: given a proof with correct computation up to, for\
          \ example, step 4, the next correctness proof is obtain by \"folding\" the\
          \ proof of correctness of step 5 into the previous proof, without the need\
          \ to store the state of the computation at every stage.\n\nRosario Gennaro,\
          \ Professor at The City University of New York\n\n“Instead of writing the\
          \ entire transcript for the computation down at each step, folding compresses\
          \ the computation and solves the space problem. There is a lot of work happening\
          \ on implementing folding schemes to build efficient zk virtual machines,\
          \ ranging from Web2 companies like Microsoft to cutting edge startups like\
          \ Lurk Lab. While this bottleneck hasn’t been fully resolved, it’s one area\
          \ where we are ahead of the curve to solve the issue and definitely an area\
          \ to watch.”\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/b353e417-a88e-4254-a055-753acd3e086f/images/370bc7f5887fac864386679801cf1ffab6db8b6348a297eca19eca6642988b8e.jpg)\n\
          \n# 3Trusted Setup\n\nSome zk proof systems require a trusted setup phase\
          \ to generate initial parameters. The trusted setup phase requires that\
          \ the individuals or entity responsible for generating these parameters\
          \ act honestly and do not keep any secret information that could compromise\
          \ the security of the system. If this setup is compromised or not performed\
          \ correctly, it can undermine the security and privacy guarantees of the\
          \ system. The field of zk proofs is rapidly evolving, with new advancements\
          \ and potential vulnerabilities regularly emerging. Continuous research\
          \ and development are essential to address security issues and improve the\
          \ efficiency of zk proof systems.\n\n# 4Interoperability\n\nDifferent zk\
          \ proof systems might use distinct standards and protocols, making it challenging\
          \ to achieve interoperability between different systems. Creating common\
          \ standards would enhance compatibility and efforts are currently underway\
          \ with the likes of The ZKProof Community. ZK proofs also often come with\
          \ proof sizes that can be large, making them less efficient to transmit\
          \ and store. Efforts to minimize proof size while maintaining security are\
          \ ongoing. To support standardization, Polybase has released a new zk benchmark\
          \ site,  [https://zkbench.dev/](https://zkbench.dev/), with detailed comparison\
          \ tables and open community reviews.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/b353e417-a88e-4254-a055-753acd3e086f/images/df233b43e2367705b1d403af7683e60927bdac7de5c1e23a174e60a5cd9ea30b.jpg)\n\
          \nSid Gandhi, co-founder of Polybase “We're at that phase in the industry\
          \ where people understand the high level capability, like keeping data private,\
          \ proving things publicly, but there is still a big educational aspect around\
          \ the trade-offs and the technical implementation, and, potentially, what\
          \ other options are available, what trade-offs exist with those options\
          \ as well. So, we are doing quite a bit of education. And then, the next\
          \ step after that is selling our actual product. So it's a two-step process\
          \ right now.”\n\n# Hardware Acceleration\n\nHardware acceleration techniques,\
          \ such as using trusted execution environments (TEEs) or specialized hardware\
          \ like ASICs, have enabled faster and more efficient computation of zk proofs.\
          \ This breakthrough has the potential to make zk proofs practical for real-time\
          \ applications.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/b353e417-a88e-4254-a055-753acd3e086f/images/8eda1ef245afb5cead9ee087f634d29759311a06dccf3e7ee5a302364ef89ab0.jpg)\n\
          \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Today's hardware is not\
          \ built for zero knowledge. ZK proofs require a massive amount of computational\
          \ resources and existing hardware (CPUs, GPUs) are not designed to handle\
          \ this computation efficiently. The main bottleneck is proof generation,\
          \ which is still too slow and expensive. In terms of timing, zk algorithms\
          \ have been developed for four decades, and zk software engineering for\
          \ about 10 years. The missing ingredient is specialized hardware in order\
          \ to accelerate proof generation, which is needed in order to commoditize\
          \ the technology and make it accessible to everyone.\n\nZK proof generation\
          \ must be an order of magnitude faster than it is today for real world use-cases.\
          \ And that's what we're working on. Most of the demand today comes from\
          \ the blockchain industry for scaling and privacy, but what makes me even\
          \ more excited for zk proofs is the fact that once we get outside of the\
          \ Web3 ecosystem, zk can impact nearly every industry, from medical research\
          \ to AI, to decentralized ID, to new online multiplayer gaming architectures,\
          \ and beyond.”\n\n# 08\\. The Future of ZK Proofs\n\n# 1Seamlessness\n\n\
          The industry is evolving at a rapid pace, with a focus on moving from research\
          \ to a business-led model. On one hand, the near future is focused on addressing\
          \ challenges and roadblocks in this space, which include hardware acceleration\
          \ and faster computation. Here, PL network teams share their top three projections\
          \ for the zk proof space in the near future.\n\nIn the next 2-5 years, Rarify\
          \ Labs expects an era of widespread integration of zk proofs across multiple\
          \ protocols and technologies. Its presence will revolutionize privacy, digital\
          \ identities, and blockchain performance, all while being seamless and mostly\
          \ invisible to users, similar to the way SSL and secure enclaves in phones\
          \ are invisible to users. ZK technology will have a user-centric flow that\
          \ enables scaling and accessibility across the digital identity space.\n\
          \n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/b353e417-a88e-4254-a055-753acd3e086f/images/68d667d380b1ab01e607a08caf04b6546a27c8d101ac63eeb9e219caa4d6004d.jpg)\n\
          \nKitty Horlick, Director, Rarify Labs\n\n“ZK proofs will help dissolve\
          \ the boundaries between Web2 and Web3, particularly within the identity\
          \ space as it is currently the only technology that sits across both realms.\
          \ More generally, zk proofs will massively reduce computation complexity\
          \ and help deliver truly performant blockchains.”\n\n# 2Client side integration\n\
          \nIn the ever-evolving landscape of cryptography, Ingonyama believes zk\
          \ proofs will transcend server-side applications and find their place within\
          \ the very devices we carry in our pockets. Imagine the power of a world\
          \ with zk proof hardware embedded directly in your mobile device, capable\
          \ of running a proof of ownership or proof of personhood.\n\n“We envision\
          \ a future in which zk is not just running on the server side like data\
          \ centers and cloud, but also on the client side – in mobile phones and\
          \ gaming machines. ZK technology is fundamental to trustless compute. We're\
          \ working to make efficient, zk proof hardware accelerators that can run\
          \ everywhere.” said Elan Neiger, marketing lead at Ingonyama.\n\n# Cost\
          \ efficient proofs\n\nAs zk proof methods evolve and proofs themselves become\
          \ smaller in size and more cost effective, they will become an attractive\
          \ option within the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT). Currently, IoT\
          \ devices store all their data in centralized storage and data is stored\
          \ directly onto their servers. ZK proofs allow for proofs to be used in\
          \ place of stored data, creating efficiencies and cutting costs.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/b353e417-a88e-4254-a055-753acd3e086f/images/9aff3383de21b1456b531420a3159a5518249a442de87a435f9a2a4fde2963ce.jpg)\n\
          \nElan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama\n\n“Another focus for the future\
          \ of zk lies with the Internet of Things (IoT). With zero knowledge, it\
          \ will be possible to cut the costs of data storage, by sending proofs instead\
          \ of data to confirm that specific stages or conditions have been met. Zero-Knowledge\
          \ also allows for yes /  no answers to complex questions involving data\
          \ or sensitive personal information. For example: do you have enough money\
          \ in your bank account to buy this car - Yes or no?  ZK today is still a\
          \ small market, but growing, because it is the most powerful cryptography\
          \ that exists for hiding data, while allowing for assertions on that data.”\n\
          \nEducation and standardization are key to the evolution of zk proofs. To\
          \ that end, Ingonyama launched an open source community effort in August\
          \ 2023: Ingopedia, a repo for all things zk for beginners and experts, ranging\
          \ from video tutorials to academic research (link). Ingopedia has been widely\
          \ cited as a good place to dive into the deep end of zero knowledge.\n\n\
          # Potential Disruptors\n\nAs the industry evolves, researchers and developers\
          \ are keeping an eye out for potential disruptors. These include quantum\
          \ computers, homomorphic encryption and interdisciplinary innovations:\n\
          \n# 1Quantum Computing\n\nIf large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers\
          \ become a reality, they could potentially break certain cryptographic primitives\
          \ that underpin zk proofs. However, should quantum computing become a reality,\
          \ we will have to change all the deployed cryptographic schemes. There is\
          \ already great progress with quantum-resistant encryption to date and industry\
          \ leaders are making strides with quantum resistant SNARKs as well.\n\n\
          Rosario Gennaro, Professor at The City University of New York\n\n“All is\
          \ not lost with the advent of quantum computing. In the future, we will\
          \ see quantum resistant SNARKs. We know how to do quantum resistant encryption\
          \ at this point. Should a quantum computer show up tomorrow, it will change\
          \ everything. It won’t happen overnight, but we'll get there.”\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/b353e417-a88e-4254-a055-753acd3e086f/images/983de6d97fe9c2c49af38b307b680e4a4235924a6f268d216ab0a1dada2ea027.jpg)\n\
          \n# 2Homomorphic Encryption\n\nFully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows\
          \ computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need to decrypt\
          \ it. FHE and zk proofs serve different roles in cryptography, and their\
          \ use cases often complement each other rather than disrupt each other.\
          \ While FHE can be used for secure computation and privacy-preserving data\
          \ analysis, zk proofs are typically employed for proving statements about\
          \ data or knowledge without revealing that data or knowledge. However, if\
          \ zk proofs over FHE computations were deployed, it could enable a new level\
          \ of privacy-preserving computation, where not only the data, but also the\
          \ operations performed on the data remain hidden. This would have significant\
          \ implications for secure cloud computing, private data analysis, and more.\n\
          \nActively building in this space, PL network team Zama is building an open\
          \ source framework that enables developers to use homomorphic encryption\
          \ to secure their Web2 and Web3 apps, without having to know cryptography.\
          \ The homomorphic programs can then be deployed locally, to the cloud or\
          \ to their upcoming decentralized infrastructure.\n\n![](https://www.protocol.ai/tmp/b353e417-a88e-4254-a055-753acd3e086f/images/98fdf9e11e6ad299d5f85c1ec009ce7878ab8177d0a8632d2432904bf17881b4.jpg)\n\
          \nRand Hindi, co-founder of Zama\n\n“While zk’s strength is in verifiability,\
          \ FHE focuses on privacy. When you combine the two together, you have the\
          \ ideal solution, because you can have confidential computing that is actually\
          \ verified. And so it's an area we’re very excited about. But zk has difficulty\
          \ scaling existing tech. The way you implement zk is complicated, you have\
          \ to resort to incredibly complex protocols. By contrast, FHE is just a\
          \ smart contract running on-chain, like every other smart contract. But\
          \ again, FHE cannot do what zk does, which is to prove that a computation\
          \ is correct. This is why the future will likely see compatibility between\
          \ the two, with zk for verifiability and FHE for privacy.”\n\n# 3Interdisciplinary\
          \ Innovations\n\nAs the adoption of zk proofs expands, experts from various\
          \ fields may come together to create novel applications and protocols. For\
          \ example, collaborations between cryptographers, blockchain developers,\
          \ AI researchers, and economists could lead to innovative solutions that\
          \ we can't foresee yet. This cross-pollination of ideas might result in\
          \ entirely new use cases and disruptive applications for zk proofs.\n\n\

          \nHarry Grieve, Co-Founder of Gensyn “Platforms will mature to the point\
          \ where they’re ready for production use and then (hopefully) many applications\
          \ will start appearing beyond the current under-the-hood/ scalability systems\
          \ like zkEVMs or the current iteration of Starknet. We’re most excited about\
          \ the applications in machine learning.”\n\nRecommendations & Advice\n\n\
          # Stay Updated with Research\n\nZero knowledge proofs is an evolving field\
          \ with constant advancements. Stay updated with the latest research papers,\
          \ conferences, and discussions in cryptography and related domains to remain\
          \ informed about new techniques and developments.\n\n# Experiment and Prototype\n\
          \nStart by experimenting with existing zk proof libraries and tools. Creating\
          \ prototypes will give you hands-on experience and help you grasp the practical\
          \ aspects of using zk proofs. Collaborate with other researchers, developers,\
          \ and experts in the field. It's a great way to learn the strengths and\
          \ limitations of different zk proof systems.\n\n# Focus on Real-World Applications\n\
          \nWhile theoretical research is important, also consider practical applications.\
          \ Think about how zk proofs can solve real-world problems like privacy-preserving\
          \ data sharing, secure authentication, or improving blockchain scalability.\n\
          \nNicola Greco, research scientist, CryptoNet\n\n“After many years, we finally\
          \ have efficient proof schemes. By efficient, I mean that the prover time\
          \ versus the normal computation time is getting closer and closer. The closer\
          \ we get, the more we can have more applications that can be verified. In\
          \ 2023, it's close enough to verify blockchain transactions. And maybe in\
          \ the future, it can be closer to verify any computation.”\n\nFurther Reading\n\

          Our personal data is a new and valuable form of currency. We’ve become progressively
          more comfortable sharing our data with third parties, yet we don’t ask often
          enough what privacy and protection policies they have in place.


          When you book a hotel room, you hand over your passport for the front desk
          agent to scan and copy. When you file a health insurance claim, you submit
          detailed medical records that may reveal sensitive information unrelated
          to the specific claim. Each exchange exposes your personal data to an unknown
          number of people in these organizations. If your information is stored and
          saved, it is vulnerable to theft or data breaches, which are becoming alarmingly
          common.


          PROMOTED


          According to the Identity Theft Resource Center''s [2023 Annual Data Breach
          Report](https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2023-annual-data-breach-report-reveals-record-number-of-compromises-72-percent-increase-over-previous-high/
          "https://www.idtheftcenter.org/post/2023-annual-data-breach-report-reveals-record-number-of-compromises-72-percent-increase-over-previous-high/"),
          there was a 78% surge in data compromises from 2022 to 2023. Healthcare,
          financial services and transportation organizations reported a twofold increase
          in compromises compared to the previous year. In [a 2023 International Association
          of Privacy Professionals report](https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf
          "https://iapp.org/media/pdf/resource_center/privacy_and_consumer_trust_report_summary.pdf"),
          almost 68% of global consumers said "they are either somewhat or very concerned
          about their online privacy," which "affects how much they trust companies,
          organizations and governments to collect, hold and use their personal data."
          More than 80% of people affected by a data breach said they are inclined
          to end their business relationship with a company after the cyberattack.


          ## The Potential Of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


          A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic technique that [dates back
          to the 1980s](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brief-history-zero-knowledge-proofs-100000129.html
          "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/brief-history-zero-knowledge-proofs-100000129.html")
          and now offers immense promise in a wide range of practical applications.
          In simple terms, a zero-knowledge proof allows one party to confirm the
          validity of a piece of information with another party without revealing
          the information itself.


          For example, a ZKP can give you a secure key or certificate to prove to
          a bartender that you are of legal drinking age without showing your ID.
          It can also enable a credit card company to verify your creditworthiness
          without divulging your financial history. Zero-knowledge proofs have enormous
          potential to improve data privacy protocols in ways that benefit both organizations
          and individuals. They relieve organizations of the burden of safely gathering,
          storing and sharing people’s data—and managing the damaging repercussions
          if a breach occurs. And they give individuals enhanced identity and transaction
          verification capabilities that won’t put their personal data at risk.


          Real-world use cases of ZKPs include:


          **• Identity Verification:** Businesses can confirm a customer’s name, age,
          driver’s license or passport number, or other personally identifiable information
          (PII) without copying or storing it.


          **• Financial Services:** Banks and other financial institutions can assess
          a customer’s financial health or enable secure, private transactions without
          revealing sensitive information.


          **• Healthcare:** Providers can validate a patient''s insurance information,
          medical history or eligibility for specific treatments without disclosing
          PII.


          • **Voting Systems:** Voters can prove that they are eligible to vote and
          that their vote was counted while maintaining the privacy of their choices.


          • **Supply Chain Management:** Companies can authenticate products without
          revealing proprietary information.


          ## Overcoming Challenges In Implementing Zero-Knowledge Proofs


          While consumers and business leaders alike are showing a growing interest
          in tools that offer increased data privacy protections, implementing zero-knowledge
          proofs will require overcoming key hurdles. ZKP technology requires substantial
          computational power, which can be costly and resource-intensive for organizations
          to implement. There is a shortage of expertise in this emerging field of
          cryptography, making it challenging for businesses to find skilled professionals
          to develop and implement zero-knowledge proof systems. Integrating and scaling
          ZKP technology within organizations’ existing infrastructure and processes
          may also pose technical challenges that slow widespread adoption.


          I believe that in the next few years, we will begin to see a significant
          shift in our collective mindset about divulging our personal information.
          As zero-knowledge proof technology continues to advance and become more
          affordable, we will see a rapid uptake in adoption. In five or ten years''
          time, we could see changes such as the emergence of tokenized identities,
          eliminating the need to share actual ID numbers or documents, and a significant
          decrease in identity theft as sensitive data becomes less vulnerable to
          breaches.


          But we have to start changing our outlook and our actions now to prepare
          for this future. I recommend the following actions:


          ### 1\. Advocate For Government Implementation


          Government agencies are responsible for issuing and verifying valid identification
          documents, so making change at the governmental level is an important starting
          point. Push for agencies to invest in zero-knowledge proof systems that
          will drive broader adoption and standardization.


          ### 2\. Start With High-Value, Low-Complexity Use Cases


          For business applications, begin implementing ZKPs in areas that offer clear
          benefits and have manageable complexity, such as identity verification or
          regulatory compliance. Experiment with small projects, and learn and iterate
          as you expand into larger initiatives.


          ### 3\. Leverage Open-Source Frameworks


          Technology can advance far more quickly in an environment of collaboration.
          Utilize existing open-source zero-knowledge proof frameworks to accelerate
          development, reduce costs, share lessons learned and benefit from community-tested
          solutions.


          ### 4\. Invest In Education And Training


          A few years ago, "prompt engineer" was not a common job title. Now, with
          the explosion of generative AI, it''s an important role for many companies.
          Be proactive about investing in educating and training your team in the
          skills of the future, including in cryptography and zero-knowledge proof
          technology.


          Zero-knowledge proofs offer a powerful tool for safeguarding data privacy
          in a digital world. As the technology continues to advance, it will likely
          play a crucial role in guaranteeing permissions across various business
          use cases and protecting individuals'' privacy rights. If you understand
          the value of this technology and explore opportunities to leverage it effectively,
          your business will be ideally positioned to improve its security posture
          and build trust with your customers.

          # Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Emerging Opportunities for the Insurance Industry


          October 2023


          ### **Authors**

          ### Description


          Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) represent an innovative suite of cryptographic
          algorithms that empower various parties, especially the insurance community,
          to validate the accuracy of sensitive information without revealing the
          actual information itself. When implemented, it could help the insurance
          industry authenticate policyholders and beneficiaries more efficiently,
          faster and, with fraud prevention mechanisms, it could facilitate communication
          with distribution channels, reinsurers or other stakeholders. Industry standards
          have not yet emerged and various technological solutions offer various tradeoffs.
          Thus, this report introduces the diverse applications and emerging opportunities
          that ZKPs offer to the insurance community, especially in the health insurance
          space.

          # What is Zero-Knowledge Proof - a hot technology bringing trustworthiness
          to Web3 privacy?


          Recently, "zero-knowledge proof" is attracting attention. In 2019, the World
          Economic Forum announced zero-knowledge proof as one of the five privacy-enhancing
          technologies that bring new value to the financial sector (\*1). Why is
          this idea, invented in the 1980s, receiving attention now? This article
          gives an overview of the technology, examples of its application, and looks
          into its future.

          ## What is Zero-Knowledge Proof?


          Zero-knowledge proof; ZKP is a technology in which a person who wants to
          prove something (Prover; hereafter referred to as P) proves the fact that
          he knows the knowledge without giving any other knowledge to the person
          who wants to verify it (Verifier; hereafter referred to as V).


          As a result, V can only verify the fact that P knows the knowledge without
          obtaining any other knowledge (Figure 1).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img01.png?h=378&iar=0&w=800&rev=6d7d71ac7c564b25984a2df33508640b)


          Figure 1: Concept of Zero-Knowledge Proof



          In the real world, when you want to assert that you hold certain credentials,
          it is common to present evidence to convince the other person that you hold
          the credentials.


          However, when you do so, the other person may be presented with too much
          information about what you want to prove, such as your address or age in
          the evidence. If you cannot trust the other person, you may feel uncomfortable
          giving them too much information. However, if you don''t show them the evidence,
          they are unlikely to trust your claim. How can you convince someone that
          you hold the qualification without giving them extra information?


          The technology to achieve this is zero-knowledge proof. The idea of zero-knowledge
          proof originated in cryptography research in the 1980s (\*2).


          - (\*2) [Goldwasser, S., Micali, S., Rackoff, C.: "The knowledge complexity
          of interactive proof-systems," STOC 1985.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22178)



          The claims that can be proven with zero-knowledge proof are knowledge about
          propositions. A proposition is a verbal expression of a judgment that is
          clearly true or false (\*3).


          - (\*3)

          For example, "2023 is equal to 7×17×17" is a proposition, and it is a true
          fact. "I know the prime factorization of 2023" is knowledge related to the
          stated proposition and is an example of a claim that can be used for zero-knowledge
          proof. On the other hand, "2023 is a large number" is subjective and not
          a proposition. Therefore, the claim that "I know 2023 is a big number" is
          not a subject of zero-knowledge proof.



          In general, a zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties: completeness,
          soundness, and zero-knowledge (Table 1).


          | Nature | Overview |

          | --- | --- |

          | Completeness | If the prover is correct, it will be determined to be correct
          by the verifier |

          | Soundness | If the prover is incorrect, it must be determined to be incorrect
          by the verifier with a high probability |

          | Zero-Knowledge | The verifier cannot obtain any knowledge other than the
          fact that the prover wants to prove |


          Table 1: Requirements for a zero-knowledge proof


          ## Intuitive understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


          Here are two examples to help you understand zero-knowledge proofs intuitively.


          ### 1\. The cave problem


          This explanation was introduced in the paper "How to explain zero-knowledge
          protocols to your children" (\*4).


          - (\*4) [Jean-Jacques Quisquater et al., "How to Explain Zero-Knowledge
          Protocols to Your Children," CRYPTO 1989. (PDF: 227KB)](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mkowalcz/628.pdf)


          Inside the cave is a magic door that opens when you say the password. The
          prover P knows the password and gives it in exchange for money. The door
          is at the far end of the cave shown in Figure 2. There are two paths to
          the door, A and B. The person who knows the password can open the door and
          move from A to B or vice versa.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img02.jpg?h=453&iar=0&w=800&rev=cf4c7228935441d3b38f0fd9442af117)


          Figure 2: The Cave Problem



          V, the verifier, wants to buy the password, but he doubts whether P really
          knows the password and cannot start a transaction. If P can convince V that
          P knows the secret password without telling V the secret password itself,
          V can start a transaction. So, here''s what they are trying to do.


          First, V waits outside the cave. Then P enters the cave, randomly chooses
          either path A or B, and goes to the door (Figure 3).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img03.jpg?h=533&iar=0&w=800&rev=0918e3fa17984bbe8d735ff3c9df3166)


          Figure 3: Prover P''s Random Selection



          Next, V enters the cave, goes to the branching point of the paths, randomly
          chooses A or B in their head, and shouts to P to come out from the chosen
          path (Figure 4).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img04.jpg?h=401&iar=0&w=800&rev=945bfc0651e54daea0b604e2edd6f2a4)


          Figure 4: Verifier V''s Random Selection



          If P knows the password:


          P can use the password to open the door and come out of the designated path,
          whichever way V tells him to go (Figure 5). This means completeness.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img05.jpg?h=466&iar=0&w=800&rev=6088ed6bec1c4fd3a3ac05b15c69a53a)


          Figure 5: The Case that Prover P Knows the Password



          If P does not know the password:


          P can only come out of the path he entered, so the probability of coming
          out of the path chosen by V is 50%. If they repeat this process over and
          over again, it''s almost impossible for P to fool V every time (Figure 6).
          For example, if they try 30 times, the probability that P can fool V is
          about 0.0000001%. This means soundness.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img06.jpg?h=421&iar=0&w=800&rev=db7f0b94506a47679157cddc1b1a33bf)


          Figure 6: The Case that Prover P Does Not Know the Password



          So, if P succeeds on all his attempts, V must be convinced that P knows
          the password. If V tries even more, he can get his chance of being cheated
          as close to 0% as V wants. At this time, V will not gain any knowledge about
          the password. This means zero-knowledge.


          Literally, what P wants to prove has been proved to V with zero-knowledge.


          ### 2\. The Problem of Finding a Seabird


          Professor Amit Sahai of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
          explains the concept of zero-knowledge proof on YouTube to children, teenagers,
          college students, graduate students, and experts in five different difficulty
          levels (\*5). Here is a child-friendly explanations that will help you get
          a sense of the main points.


          - (\*5) [Computer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty,
          WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)


          The professor shows the child a picture. The picture shows a crowd of hundreds
          of penguins. He says, "There is one puffin (a penguin-like seabird), and
          I know where it is, but I don''t want to tell you. Do you believe me? I''m
          going to prove it without revealing its location."


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img07.jpg?h=505&iar=0&w=800&rev=3f05fc0c1f934735a75fbbae8353800f)


          Figure 7: The Problem of Finding a Seabird



          The professor pulls out a piece of black paper several times larger than
          the photo. The paper has a small hole, and the photo is pasted on the back
          of the paper so that the hole matches the position of the puffin. The child
          looks into the hole and says, "I see a puffin". But the child can''t see
          the position of the photo on the back of the paper, so she can''t tell where
          the puffin is in the original photo. "This is an example of a zero-knowledge
          proof," the professor explains (Figure 8).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img08.jpg?h=370&iar=0&w=800&rev=46de5598e3f64c609c0c7fd1a156c661)


          Figure 8: Zero-Knowledge Proof for the Problem of Finding a Seabird



          This exchange satisfies completeness because a professor who knows the location
          of the puffin can always prove it.


          Furthermore, it satisfies soundness because if the professor does not know
          the location of the puffin, the cheating will be exposed with a high probability
          if the child looks into the hole and confirms it.


          Furthermore, it satisfies zero-knowledge because the child cannot obtain
          any knowledge other than the fact that the professor knows the location
          of the puffin.


          ## Social Application Examples


          This paper introduces an application example of zero-knowledge proof to
          society and considers prospects.


          ### 1\. Blockchain Privacy Enhancement


          Blockchain is widely used in society, a representative example being virtual
          currencies. Its transparency is maintained by decentralized management of
          its ledger by all participants in the blockchain. However, due to its high
          transparency, securing user privacy may be a challenge.


          In recent years, zero-knowledge proofs have begun to be used to improve
          blockchain privacy. For example, in the case of cryptocurrencies, methods
          known collectively as zk-SNARK (\*6) and zk-STARK (\*7) have begun to be
          introduced as zero-knowledge proofs to show that the transaction operation
          was indeed performed, without disclosing the transaction contents such as
          the sender, recipient, and remittance amount.


          In addition, zero-knowledge proofs have attracted even more attention because
          they can contribute to speeding up blockchain processing.

          ### 2\. Proof of Income Range


          In November 2017, ING, a major Dutch bank, developed zero-knowledge range
          proofs (ZKRP) (\*8). ZKRP is an application of zero-knowledge proofs. ZKRP
          can prove that a numerical value, such as an amount of money, is within
          a certain range without showing the numerical value to the other party.
          For example, mortgage applicants can prove that their income is within a
          certain range required by loan screening without telling the income itself.


          - (\*8)[ING launches Zero-Knowledge Range Proof solution, a major addition
          to blockchain technology](https://www.ingwb.com/en/insights/distributed-ledger-technology/ing-launches-major-addition-to-blockchain-technology)


          ### 3\. Selective Disclosure of Attribute Information


          The W3C, which standardizes Web technologies, has standardized a data model
          for the concept of verifiable credentials (VC) (\*9). It introduces zero-knowledge
          proof, in which you select your attribute information and prove only that
          the attribute satisfies certain conditions.


          For example, it shows a use case in which you select and prove only the
          information that a university graduate received a degree without revealing
          his or her identity or other unnecessary personal information.


          - (\*9) [W3C Recommendation, Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1, 2022.](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs)



          VC is currently being discussed in the "Trusted Web" initiative led by the
          Cabinet Secretariat of Japan. It shows the expectation of zero-knowledge
          proof as a method to realize selective disclosure of data(\*10).


          - (\*10) [Secretariat of the Headquarters for Digital Market Competition,
          the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan, "Trusted Web White Paper Ver 2.0, Overview"
          August 2022 (PDF: 1.7MB)](https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/digitalmarket/pdf_e/Trusted_Web_White_Paper_ver2.0_Overview.pdf)


          ### 4\. User Authentication


          Currently, ID and password authentication is mainly used for websites of
          various services. However, since the string length of a password is limited
          to a range that can be remembered or managed by the human brain, it is vulnerable
          to brute-force and password-list-type attacks.


          Furthermore, if an attacker takes over the server, not only the password
          itself, but also information useful for guessing the password is leaked,
          which becomes a hint for the attacker, and the password may be leaked in
          the future. If user authentication is implemented with zero-knowledge proof,
          the server can be more secure because no information related to the password
          exists from the beginning.


          As a zero-knowledge proof that can be applied to user authentication, there
          is the Schnorr protocol (\*11). In this method, knowledge about the solution
          of a mathematically difficult problem called the discrete logarithm problem
          is assumed to be information that only the user can know and is authenticated
          with zero-knowledge proof. Compared with the ID and password method, this
          method has not been adopted in the world for many years due to its disadvantages
          such as high communication volume, slow processing speed, and "The size
          of the data to be kept secret is too large for humans to remember."


          - (\*11) [IETF, RFC 8235, Schnorr Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof,
          September 2017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8235)


          In recent years, however, with the spread of technologies such as "faster
          communication networks," "faster processing speeds of servers and terminals,"
          and "memory areas that can be securely stored in smart cards and smartphones,"
          conventional disadvantages are going to be no longer disadvantages.


          ## Prospect


          In recent years, the term "Web3" has attracted attention, and although there
          are various interpretations, its constituent concepts are said to be centered
          on "blockchain," "decentralization" and "decentralized ID." Application
          cases (1) and (2) mentioned above are measures to improve the privacy of
          blockchain, and (3) and (4) are related to decentralization and decentralized
          ID. Therefore, zero-knowledge proof can be said to be "a technology that
          brings trustworthiness to the privacy of Web3."


          In the future, zero-knowledge proof will become an essential technology
          for safe and secure future societies that require a high level of privacy.


          NTT DATA will continue to keep up with the latest trends and accumulate
          and disclose know-hows.

          # What is Zero-Knowledge Proof - a hot technology bringing trustworthiness
          to Web3 privacy?


          Recently, "zero-knowledge proof" is attracting attention. In 2019, the World
          Economic Forum announced zero-knowledge proof as one of the five privacy-enhancing
          technologies that bring new value to the financial sector (\*1). Why is
          this idea, invented in the 1980s, receiving attention now? This article
          gives an overview of the technology, examples of its application, and looks
          into its future.

          ## What is Zero-Knowledge Proof?


          Zero-knowledge proof; ZKP is a technology in which a person who wants to
          prove something (Prover; hereafter referred to as P) proves the fact that
          he knows the knowledge without giving any other knowledge to the person
          who wants to verify it (Verifier; hereafter referred to as V).


          As a result, V can only verify the fact that P knows the knowledge without
          obtaining any other knowledge (Figure 1).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img01.png?h=378&iar=0&w=800&rev=6d7d71ac7c564b25984a2df33508640b)


          Figure 1: Concept of Zero-Knowledge Proof



          In the real world, when you want to assert that you hold certain credentials,
          it is common to present evidence to convince the other person that you hold
          the credentials.


          However, when you do so, the other person may be presented with too much
          information about what you want to prove, such as your address or age in
          the evidence. If you cannot trust the other person, you may feel uncomfortable
          giving them too much information. However, if you don''t show them the evidence,
          they are unlikely to trust your claim. How can you convince someone that
          you hold the qualification without giving them extra information?


          The technology to achieve this is zero-knowledge proof. The idea of zero-knowledge
          proof originated in cryptography research in the 1980s (\*2).


          - (\*2) [Goldwasser, S., Micali, S., Rackoff, C.: "The knowledge complexity
          of interactive proof-systems," STOC 1985.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22178)



          The claims that can be proven with zero-knowledge proof are knowledge about
          propositions. A proposition is a verbal expression of a judgment that is
          clearly true or false (\*3).


          - (\*3)

          For example, "2023 is equal to 7×17×17" is a proposition, and it is a true
          fact. "I know the prime factorization of 2023" is knowledge related to the
          stated proposition and is an example of a claim that can be used for zero-knowledge
          proof. On the other hand, "2023 is a large number" is subjective and not
          a proposition. Therefore, the claim that "I know 2023 is a big number" is
          not a subject of zero-knowledge proof.



          In general, a zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties: completeness,
          soundness, and zero-knowledge (Table 1).


          | Nature | Overview |

          | --- | --- |

          | Completeness | If the prover is correct, it will be determined to be correct
          by the verifier |

          | Soundness | If the prover is incorrect, it must be determined to be incorrect
          by the verifier with a high probability |

          ## Intuitive understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


          Here are two examples to help you understand zero-knowledge proofs intuitively.


          ### 1\. The cave problem


          This explanation was introduced in the paper "How to explain zero-knowledge
          protocols to your children" (\*4).


          - (\*4) [Jean-Jacques Quisquater et al., "How to Explain Zero-Knowledge
          Protocols to Your Children," CRYPTO 1989. (PDF: 227KB)](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mkowalcz/628.pdf)


          Inside the cave is a magic door that opens when you say the password. The
          prover P knows the password and gives it in exchange for money. The door
          is at the far end of the cave shown in Figure 2. There are two paths to
          the door, A and B. The person who knows the password can open the door and
          move from A to B or vice versa.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img02.jpg?h=453&iar=0&w=800&rev=cf4c7228935441d3b38f0fd9442af117)


          Figure 2: The Cave Problem



          V, the verifier, wants to buy the password, but he doubts whether P really
          knows the password and cannot start a transaction. If P can convince V that
          P knows the secret password without telling V the secret password itself,
          V can start a transaction. So, here''s what they are trying to do.


          First, V waits outside the cave. Then P enters the cave, randomly chooses
          either path A or B, and goes to the door (Figure 3).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img03.jpg?h=533&iar=0&w=800&rev=0918e3fa17984bbe8d735ff3c9df3166)


          Figure 3: Prover P''s Random Selection



          Next, V enters the cave, goes to the branching point of the paths, randomly
          chooses A or B in their head, and shouts to P to come out from the chosen
          path (Figure 4).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img04.jpg?h=401&iar=0&w=800&rev=945bfc0651e54daea0b604e2edd6f2a4)


          Figure 4: Verifier V''s Random Selection



          If P knows the password:


          P can use the password to open the door and come out of the designated path,
          whichever way V tells him to go (Figure 5). This means completeness.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img05.jpg?h=466&iar=0&w=800&rev=6088ed6bec1c4fd3a3ac05b15c69a53a)


          Figure 5: The Case that Prover P Knows the Password



          If P does not know the password:


          P can only come out of the path he entered, so the probability of coming
          out of the path chosen by V is 50%. If they repeat this process over and
          over again, it''s almost impossible for P to fool V every time (Figure 6).
          For example, if they try 30 times, the probability that P can fool V is
          about 0.0000001%. This means soundness.


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img06.jpg?h=421&iar=0&w=800&rev=db7f0b94506a47679157cddc1b1a33bf)


          Figure 6: The Case that Prover P Does Not Know the Password



          So, if P succeeds on all his attempts, V must be convinced that P knows
          the password. If V tries even more, he can get his chance of being cheated
          as close to 0% as V wants. At this time, V will not gain any knowledge about
          the password. This means zero-knowledge.


          Literally, what P wants to prove has been proved to V with zero-knowledge.


          ### 2\. The Problem of Finding a Seabird


          Professor Amit Sahai of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
          explains the concept of zero-knowledge proof on YouTube to children, teenagers,
          college students, graduate students, and experts in five different difficulty
          levels (\*5). Here is a child-friendly explanations that will help you get
          a sense of the main points.


          - (\*5) [Computer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty,
          WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)


          The professor shows the child a picture. The picture shows a crowd of hundreds
          of penguins. He says, "There is one puffin (a penguin-like seabird), and
          I know where it is, but I don''t want to tell you. Do you believe me? I''m
          going to prove it without revealing its location."


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img07.jpg?h=505&iar=0&w=800&rev=3f05fc0c1f934735a75fbbae8353800f)


          Figure 7: The Problem of Finding a Seabird



          The professor pulls out a piece of black paper several times larger than
          the photo. The paper has a small hole, and the photo is pasted on the back
          of the paper so that the hole matches the position of the puffin. The child
          looks into the hole and says, "I see a puffin". But the child can''t see
          the position of the photo on the back of the paper, so she can''t tell where
          the puffin is in the original photo. "This is an example of a zero-knowledge
          proof," the professor explains (Figure 8).


          ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img08.jpg?h=370&iar=0&w=800&rev=46de5598e3f64c609c0c7fd1a156c661)


          Figure 8: Zero-Knowledge Proof for the Problem of Finding a Seabird



          This exchange satisfies completeness because a professor who knows the location
          of the puffin can always prove it.


          Furthermore, it satisfies soundness because if the professor does not know
          the location of the puffin, the cheating will be exposed with a high probability
          if the child looks into the hole and confirms it.


          Furthermore, it satisfies zero-knowledge because the child cannot obtain
          any knowledge other than the fact that the professor knows the location
          of the puffin.


          ## Social Application Examples


          This paper introduces an application example of zero-knowledge proof to
          society and considers prospects.


          ### 1\. Blockchain Privacy Enhancement


          Blockchain is widely used in society, a representative example being virtual
          currencies. Its transparency is maintained by decentralized management of
          its ledger by all participants in the blockchain. However, due to its high
          transparency, securing user privacy may be a challenge.


          In recent years, zero-knowledge proofs have begun to be used to improve
          blockchain privacy. For example, in the case of cryptocurrencies, methods
          known collectively as zk-SNARK (\*6) and zk-STARK (\*7) have begun to be
          introduced as zero-knowledge proofs to show that the transaction operation
          was indeed performed, without disclosing the transaction contents such as
          the sender, recipient, and remittance amount.


          In addition, zero-knowledge proofs have attracted even more attention because
          they can contribute to speeding up blockchain processing.

          ### 2\. Proof of Income Range


          In November 2017, ING, a major Dutch bank, developed zero-knowledge range
          proofs (ZKRP) (\*8). ZKRP is an application of zero-knowledge proofs. ZKRP
          can prove that a numerical value, such as an amount of money, is within
          a certain range without showing the numerical value to the other party.
          For example, mortgage applicants can prove that their income is within a
          certain range required by loan screening without telling the income itself.

          to blockchain technology](https://www.ingwb.com/en/insights/distributed-ledger-technology/ing-launches-major-addition-to-blockchain-technology)


          ### 3\. Selective Disclosure of Attribute Information


          The W3C, which standardizes Web technologies, has standardized a data model
          for the concept of verifiable credentials (VC) (\*9). It introduces zero-knowledge
          proof, in which you select your attribute information and prove only that
          the attribute satisfies certain conditions.


          For example, it shows a use case in which you select and prove only the
          information that a university graduate received a degree without revealing
          his or her identity or other unnecessary personal information.


          - (\*9) [W3C Recommendation, Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1, 2022.](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs)



          VC is currently being discussed in the "Trusted Web" initiative led by the
          Cabinet Secretariat of Japan. It shows the expectation of zero-knowledge
          proof as a method to realize selective disclosure of data(\*10).


          - (\*10) [Secretariat of the Headquarters for Digital Market Competition,
          the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan, "Trusted Web White Paper Ver 2.0, Overview"
          August 2022 (PDF: 1.7MB)](https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/digitalmarket/pdf_e/Trusted_Web_White_Paper_ver2.0_Overview.pdf)


          ### 4\. User Authentication


          Currently, ID and password authentication is mainly used for websites of
          various services. However, since the string length of a password is limited
          to a range that can be remembered or managed by the human brain, it is vulnerable
          to brute-force and password-list-type attacks.


          Furthermore, if an attacker takes over the server, not only the password
          itself, but also information useful for guessing the password is leaked,
          which becomes a hint for the attacker, and the password may be leaked in
          the future. If user authentication is implemented with zero-knowledge proof,
          the server can be more secure because no information related to the password
          exists from the beginning.


          As a zero-knowledge proof that can be applied to user authentication, there
          is the Schnorr protocol (\*11). In this method, knowledge about the solution
          of a mathematically difficult problem called the discrete logarithm problem
          is assumed to be information that only the user can know and is authenticated
          with zero-knowledge proof. Compared with the ID and password method, this
          method has not been adopted in the world for many years due to its disadvantages
          such as high communication volume, slow processing speed, and "The size
          of the data to be kept secret is too large for humans to remember."


          - (\*11) [IETF, RFC 8235, Schnorr Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof,
          September 2017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8235)


          In recent years, however, with the spread of technologies such as "faster
          communication networks," "faster processing speeds of servers and terminals,"
          and "memory areas that can be securely stored in smart cards and smartphones,"
          conventional disadvantages are going to be no longer disadvantages.


          ## Prospect


          In recent years, the term "Web3" has attracted attention, and although there
          are various interpretations, its constituent concepts are said to be centered
          on "blockchain," "decentralization" and "decentralized ID." Application
          cases (1) and (2) mentioned above are measures to improve the privacy of
          blockchain, and (3) and (4) are related to decentralization and decentralized
          ID. Therefore, zero-knowledge proof can be said to be "a technology that
          brings trustworthiness to the privacy of Web3."


          In the future, zero-knowledge proof will become an essential technology
          for safe and secure future societies that require a high level of privacy.


          NTT DATA will continue to keep up with the latest trends and accumulate
          and disclose know-hows.

          \n## Introduction\n\nFrom finance to communications to commerce, the most\
          \ essential things in our lives are increasingly digital, and at a pace\
          \ that only continues to accelerate. This has fostered unprecedented economic\
          \ growth and technological innovations, however our most sensitive and private\
          \ information has necessarily come along for the ride. This puts individuals,\
          \ private organizations, and governments increasingly at risk of becoming\
          \ victims of data breaches and hacks.\n\nSolutions to these problems often\
          \ call for increased know your customer practices (KYC) and reporting. KYC\
          \ is a regulatory and security process where businesses verify the identity\
          \ of their clients to prevent identity theft, financial fraud, money laundering,\
          \ and terrorist financing. While there are benefits to this approach, it\
          \ comes with the risk of sensitive data being distributed to even more parties,\
          \ thus increasing the potential surface area for attack, and further reducing\
          \ individual privacy. In a world where trust in institutions is historically\
          \ low, this can be a hard pill for individuals to swallow. But what if there\
          \ was a solution that allowed individuals, private organizations, and governments\
          \ alike to verify things like identity and financial data with said data\
          \ always remaining encrypted and obfuscated? What if you didn’t have to\
          \ trust because instead, you could verify?\n\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)\
          \ have emerged as a pivotal cryptographic innovation representing a paradigm\
          \ shift replacing the need to trust with the ability to _verify_. This comprehensive\
          \ exploration will shed light on how ZKPs are reshaping privacy and security\
          \ paradigms across various sectors. By the end of this article, policymakers\
          \ will have gained a nuanced understanding of ZKPs' potential to improve\
          \ security while maintaining privacy across a wide range of use cases and\
          \ why they are indispensable in today’s digital ecosystem.\n\n## An Idea\
          \ Ahead of Its Time\n\nFirst described in a [1985 MIT paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf),\
          \ zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have been an idea simmering on the back burner\
          \ of cryptographic research for decades. Although conceptually sound, the\
          \ technology required for large-scale and cost-effective deployment was\
          \ not yet available. However, with recent advancements in computational\
          \ power and the advent of blockchain technology, ZKPs are now coming to\
          \ the forefront.\n\nThe feasibility of ZKP applications now being able to\
          \ be deployed at scale can be attributed primarily to two key developments:\n\
          \n1. **Advancements in Computational Power:** Historically, ZKPs were computationally\
          \ intensive, requiring significant processing power which limited their\
          \ practicality. The exponential growth in computational capabilities, in\
          \ particular, more efficient processors and the widespread availability\
          \ of cloud computing, has made it feasible to perform complex ZKP computations\
          \ quickly and cost-effectively.\n\n2. **Synergies with Blockchain Technology:**\
          \ The cryptographic nature of ZKPs aligns seamlessly with blockchain technologies.\
          \ Blockchain's inherent characteristics of decentralization, immutability,\
          \ and transparency provide a conducive environment for ZKP applications.\
          \ Several blockchain platforms have integrated ZKPs as a core component\
          \ of their technology stack, fostering ready-built platforms for the development\
          \ and deployment of ZKP-based applications.\n\n\nThese technological advancements\
          \ have transformed ZKPs from a theoretical concept into a practical tool,\
          \ unlocking their potential to enhance privacy and security in an increasingly\
          \ digital world.\n\n## How Do Zero-Knowledge Proofs Work?\n\nIn a zero-knowledge\
          \ proof, there are two parties: a prover and a verifier. In this transaction,\
          \ the prover can assure a verifier of the truthfulness of a particular assertion\
          \ regarding a data point without revealing any extra details about the corresponding\
          \ data.\n\nZKPs can be categorized into two types:\n\n- **Interactive**,\
          \ where the prover must engage in the verification process anew for each\
          \ distinct verifier.\n\n- **Non-interactiv** e, where the prover creates\
          \ a universally verifiable proof.\n\n\nThe three key characteristics that\
          \ encapsulate a ZKP are:\n\n- **Completeness**: For any true statement,\
          \ a credible prover can successfully persuade an honest verifier of their\
          \ knowledge about the accurate input.\n\n- **Soundness:** In the case of\
          \ a false statement, no deceitful prover can independently convince an honest\
          \ verifier of their knowledge about the accurate input.\n\n- **Zero-Knowledge**:\
          \ When the statement is true, the verifier gains no additional information\
          \ from the prover beyond the fact that the statement is indeed true.\n\n\
          \nThe math that makes this possible is beyond the scope of this piece, however,\
          \ a simple example can help conceptualize how a ZKP works.\n\nImagine you\
          \ have a \"Where's Waldo?\" book, and you claim to know exactly where Waldo\
          \ is on a particular page. Your friend, however, is skeptical and wants\
          \ proof of your claim. But here's the challenge: you need to prove you know\

          \nHere's how you can do it: \"Where's Waldo?\"\n\n1. **The Challenge:**\
          \ You open the \"Where's Waldo?\" book to the page in question and show\
          \ it to your friend.\n\n2. **The Proof Technique:** To prove your knowledge\
          \ without revealing Waldo's location, you take a large piece of cardboard\
          \ with a small hole cut in it.\n\n3. **The Verification:** You place the\
          \ cardboard over the page so that the hole reveals Waldo, but nothing else\
          \ on the page is visible. Your friend can now see Waldo through the hole,\
          \ confirming you know his location.\n\n4. **Maintaining Secrecy:** Despite\
          \ verifying your claim, your friend still doesn't know where on the page\
          \ Waldo is. The rest of the page is covered, keeping the information hidden.\n\
          \n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- **Completeness:** If you truly know where Waldo\
          \ is, you can easily align the hole in the cardboard to reveal him, convincing\
          \ your friend of your knowledge.\n\n- **Soundness:** If you don’t actually\
          \ know where Waldo is, you won’t be able to align the hole correctly, and\
          \ your friend won’t be convinced of your claim.\n\n- **Zero-Knowledge:**\
          \ Despite proving you know Waldo’s location, you haven’t revealed any additional\
          \ information about where on the page Waldo is.\n\n\nThese proofs enable\
          \ one party to prove the validity of a statement to another without revealing\
          \ any underlying information. In an era where data breaches are rampant,\
          \ ZKPs offer hope for secure and private online interactions.\n\n## A Myriad\
          \ of Real-World and Digital-World Applications\n\nZKPs have a wide array\
          \ of applications, each demonstrating their versatility and importance in\
          \ enhancing privacy and security in various digital domains:\n\n### Decentralized\
          \ Identity and Authentication:\n\nZKPs can serve as a foundational technology\
          \ for identity management systems by offering a dual advantage: they enable\
          \ robust identity verification while safeguarding personal information.\
          \ This is particularly relevant in systems built on blockchains, which are\
          \ inherently global and interoperable, facilitating secure international\
          \ information sharing.\n\n- **Offline Applications:** ZKPs can be used in\
          \ everyday situations like confirming age for alcohol purchase or even verifying\
          \ citizenship and non-sanctioned status at international borders. In these\
          \ cases, ZKPs provide proof of specific personal attributes without revealing\
          \ any additional personal information.\n\n- **Online Applications:** The\
          \ decentralized nature of blockchain networks limits traditional KYC practices,\
          \ but ZKPs offer a way for central entities to securely verify user identities.\n\
          \n\nSince it is one of the most impactful applications of ZKPs, the following\
          \ section takes a deep dive into decentralized identity.\n\n### Voting Systems:\n\
          \nZKPs introduce a new paradigm in voting systems, particularly in conjunction\
          \ with distributed ledger technologies. Together, they enable a voting process\
          \ that is both anonymous and verifiable, enhancing the integrity and transparency\
          \ of elections.\n\n- **Identity Verification and Eligibility Checks:** Leveraging\
          \ the decentralized identity solutions discussed earlier, ZKPs can be used\
          \ to verify a voter's identity and their eligibility to vote. This approach\
          \ ensures that only qualified individuals participate in the voting process\
          \ and that no one can vote more than once. Such identity verification acts\
          \ as a gatekeeper to access existing voting systems, upholding the principle\
          \ that every vote counts and should be counted correctly.\n\n- **Anonymous\
          \ Verifiable Voting:** Beyond verifying voter identity, ZKPs can preserve\
          \ the anonymity of the voting process. Voters can confidently validate their\
          \ eligibility and cast their ballots without having to reveal their identities\
          \ or the specifics of their vote. This application of ZKPs allows each vote\
          \ to remain confidential while ensuring the entire voting process is transparent\
          \ and auditable.\n\n- **Auditable Yet Private Voting System:** The integration\
          \ of ZKPs in voting systems is transformative, enhancing both the verification\
          \ mechanism and the voting process itself. By incorporating ZKPs, the system\
          \ not only links each vote to an eligible voter but also maintains voter\
          \ anonymity. This dual capability creates a voting environment that is secure,\
          \ transparent, and respectful of voter privacy. The system can be implemented\
          \ either as an identity check before accessing existing voting platforms\
          \ or as an integral part of a new blockchain-based voting system, embedding\
          \ both identity verification and vote casting within a unified, secure framework.\n\
          \n\n### AI and Machine Learning:\n\n- Privacy Preservation in Data Usage:\n\
          \  - A key challenge in AI and machine learning is accessing large datasets\
          \ for training models without compromising sensitive information contained\
          \ within the data. ZKPs enable the verification of data authenticity and\
          \ integrity for these models while keeping the underlying data elements\
          \ private.\n\n  - The capability to verify information while maintain privacy\
          \ is particularly crucial in industries like healthcare or finance, where\
          \ data confidentiality is paramount. ZKPs allow for the utilization of detailed\
          \ datasets for model training without exposing individual data points, thus\
          \ upholding privacy standards and regulatory compliance.\n- Blockchain Integration\
          \ for Model Accountability:\n  - Combining ZKPs with blockchain technology\
          \ introduces a new level of transparency and accountability in AI and machine\
          \ learning. Blockchain provides an immutable record of transactions which\
          \ enables the tracking of data changes, model updates, and decision-making\
          \ processes when applied to AI models.\n\n  - This integration allows for\
          \ a transparent audit trail of how AI models evolve over time and how data\
          \ influences these models. It addresses concerns around model integrity\
          \ and reliability, ensuring that changes or updates to AI systems are transparent\
          \ and accountable.\n- Enhancing Trust in AI Systems:\n  - By utilizing ZKPs,\
          \ AI and machine learning systems can demonstrate that they function as\
          \ intended without revealing their internal workings or the proprietary\
          \ data they process. This builds trust among users and stakeholders, assuring\
          \ them that the AI systems are not only effective but also respect privacy\
          \ and data security.\n\n  - In scenarios where decisions made by AI systems\
          \ need to be justified or explained, such as in credit scoring or medical\
          \ diagnostics, the combination of ZKPs and blockchain can provide necessary\
          \ assurances about the data and processes used without compromising sensitive\
          \ information.\n- Facilitating Collaborative AI Development:\n  - ZKPs enable\
          \ multiple parties to contribute data to AI models securely and privately.\
          \ This collaborative approach, bolstered by the trust mechanisms of ZKPs\
          \ and blockchain, can accelerate AI innovation by allowing diverse data\
          \ sources to be used collectively, broadening the scope and applicability\
          \ of AI solutions.\n\n### Privacy on Public Blockchains:\n\n- The immutable\
          \ and public nature of data stored on a blockchain is a defining and often\
          \ beneficial feature, this feature can become an issue in transactions that\
          \ require privacy. For more on the challenges and opportunities presented\
          \ by the transparent nature of public blockchains, check out our previous\
          \ [Blockchain Brief on blockchain privacy.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/blockchain-worlds-least-private-diary)\n\
          \  - **Private Transactions:** ZKPs are used in blockchains for privacy-preserving\
          \ transactions that keep details like monetary amounts and participant identities\
          \ private.  ZKPs can keep this information private while verifying that\
          \ users are not participating in illicit activity or transacting with sanctioned\
          \ entities.\n\n  - **Private Exchange and Settlement of Digital Assets:**\
          \ ZKPs ensure the privacy of transactions and participants during the exchange\
          \ of digital tokens, such as equity tokens. This is crucial for both centralized\
          \ and decentralized exchanges, allowing for efficient and private asset\
          \ settlement. As more real-world assets (RWAs) like real estate and high-valuable\
          \ collectibles are tokenized and more transactions involving RWAs are conducted\
          \ on-chain, this efficiency and privacy is paramount.\n\n### Scalable Ethereum\
          \ Layer 2 Rollups:\n\nZKPs, through methods like zero-knowledge rollups\
          \ (ZK-rollups), are highly secure and scalable Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum\
          \ that facilitate faster, more efficient transactions. If you need a refresher\
          \ on the difference between a Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain before we dive\
          \ deeper into the current state of ZK rollups, be sure to check out our\
          \ previous [Blockchain Brief where we break it down.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks)\n\
          \n### Oracle-Enhanced Verifiable Computations:\n\n- In decentralized oracle\
          \ networks, ZKPs can be leveraged for verifiable computations related to\
          \ off-chain data points. [As explained in a previous Blockchain Brief](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/delphi-defi-how-crypto-oracles-are-shaping-future-finance),\
          \ blockchain oracles provide smart contracts with access to external data\
          \ and computation results. Using ZKPs in this context ensures the integrity\
          \ and confidentiality of the data processed by the oracles. Relevant off-chain\
          \ data points include:Financial Data: Verifying stock prices or foreign\
          \ exchange rates for use in smart contracts without revealing sensitive\
          \ market data.\n\n- Supply Chain Information: Confirming the authenticity\
          \ of supply chain events like product manufacturing or shipping status without\
          \ disclosing proprietary details.\n\n- Real-World Events: Maintaining data\
          \ privacy while validating outcomes of real-world events, like sports results\
          \ and election outcomes, that impact contract executions Weather Data: Securely\
          \ integrating weather information for agriculture-related smart contracts\
          \ without full data exposure.\n\n\n### Internet of Things (IoT):\n\n- Securing\
          \ IoT device communications and reducing data transmission through ZKPs\
          \ enhances both privacy and efficiency in interconnected devices.\n\n\n\
          ### Supply Chains:\n\n- ZKPs can authenticate compliance and origin in supply\
          \ chain management without revealing sensitive data, which is crucial for\
          \ businesses that wish to keep supplier information confidential.\n\n\n\
          These diverse applications across sectors underscores the significance of\
          \ ZKPs in addressing privacy and security challenges in the digital age\
          \ by offering robust solutions for secure, private, and efficient digital\
          \ interactions.\n\n## A Deeper Dive into Decentralized Digital Identity\
          \ and Securing Personal Identifiable Information\n\nZero-knowledge proofs\
          \ present a unique solution to address the urgent need for safe and secure\
          \ methods of digital identity verification and storage of personal identifiable\
          \ information (PII). ZPKs minimize the exposure of PII by enabling the verification\
          \ of essential information while keeping other personal details hidden,\
          \ thereby fortifying systems against data breaches and preserving individual\
          \ privacy. This is crucial in scenarios ranging from social media interactions\
          \ to financial transactions.\n\nConsider the routine action of showing an\
          \ ID to purchase alcohol – you inadvertently expose more information than\
          \ necessary.\n\nThe cashier only needs to verify two things: that the id\
          \ is a valid, government issued id and that you are 21 or older. Yet you\
          \ are revealing your full name, home address, birthdate and age, sex, height,\
          \ weight, eye color, and driver’s license number. These pieces of information\
          \ are individually harmless, but when they are used together, there is potential\
          \ for abuse, not to mention a violation of an individual’s right to privacy.\n\
          \nThis scenario is amplified online, where the sharing of social security\
          \ numbers, financial details, and personal activities often leads to privacy\
          \ invasion and increases the risk of cyberattacks. Consider the following\
          \ three examples representing massive misuse and exposure of sensitive user\
          \ data, and how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) could have potentially mitigated\
          \ these incidents:\n\n1\\. Cambridge Analytica Scandal:\n\n- **Real-World\
          \ Incident:** A third-party app, This Is Your Digital Life, allowed unauthorized\
          \ collection of personal data from millions of Facebook users. Cambridge\
          \ Analytica used that data for political advertising, including in the 2016\
          \ U.S. presidential election campaign. This breach raised significant concerns\
          \ about privacy and the influence of social media on politics.\n\n- **ZKP\
          \ Mitigation:** ZKPs could have been used to verify the specific user attributes\
          \ (e.g., age, location, political interests) necessary for academic research\
          \ or targeted advertising without revealing or transferring the underlying\
          \ data. That way, Facebook could confirm specific demographics of its user\
          \ base to third parties without exposing individual user data.\n\n\n2\\\
          .  T-Mobile Data Breaches:\n\n- **Real-World Incident:** Caused by a misconfigured\
          \ API, T-Mobile experienced a data breach that exposed the personal data\
          \ of 37 million customers. The stolen data was used by cybercriminals for\
          \ sophisticated phishing, vishing, and smishing attacks.\n\n- **ZKP Mitigation:**\
          \ ZKPs could have been employed in T-Mobile’s data handling processes to\
          \ validate user identity and credentials without exposing user data. For\
          \ instance, a customer service application could verify that a person is\
          \ a T-Mobile customer and check their plan details without the API accessing\
          \ the full range of personal information stored in the database.\n\n\n3\\\
          . Equifax Data Breach of 2017:\n\n- **Real-World Incident:** This breach,\
          \ one of the largest in U.S. history, compromised the personal information\
          \ of about 147.9 million Americans, as well as millions of British and Canadian\
          \ citizens. Hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers, birth dates,\
          \ addresses, and in some cases, driver's license numbers. The breach was\
          \ deemed \"entirely preventable\" by the House Committee on Oversight.\n\
          \n- **ZKP Mitigation:** If ZKPs had been used, Equifax could have allowed\
          \ third-party services to confirm individuals' creditworthiness or identity\
          \ without accessing detailed personal data like Social Security numbers\
          \ or birth dates. For example, a lender could verify if a person's credit\
          \ score falls within a specific range without Equifax needing to share the\
          \ actual credit report.\n\n\nIn each of these scenarios, ZKPs would have\
          \ offered a way to validate and prove necessary information without exposing\
          \ data, thus significantly reducing the risk of data breaches and misuse\
          \ of personal information. Implementing ZKPs requires rethinking how systems\
          \ interact with personal data and moving towards a model where verification\
          \ is possible without data exposure. The adoption of ZKPs benefits individuals\
          \ whose personal data remains protected and private as well as businesses,\
          \ which can avoid the substantial financial and reputational damage often\
          \ associated with such data breaches. By enhancing data security and integrity,\
          \ ZKPs provide two key benefits: they help in building trust among consumers\
          \ and simultaneously safeguard businesses against the risks and liabilities\
          \ of data mismanagement.\n\n## The Current State of ZK-Rollups\n\nAs noted\
          \ earlier, the two developments that have allowed ZKPs to finally transition\
          \ from academic concept to real world use have been increased power and\
          \ availability of compute and blockchains. While smart contract platforms\
          \ like Solana and Avalanche have seen significant growth in daily active\
          \ users, ecosystem development, and capital inflows in 2023, Ethereum and\
          \ its Layer 2 blockchains remain the dominant smart contract ecosystem.\
          \ As of 1/17/24, Ethereum and its L2 chains have a combined market cap ($322B)\
          \ 1.6X higher than [every other smart contract platform combined](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform)\
          \ and 72% ($78B) of [total value locked](https://defillama.com/chains) (TVL)\
          \ in [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/defi-101-good-bad-and-regulatory).\n\
          \nAs discussed in our previous article, breaking down the difference between\
          \ [L1 and L2 Ethereum](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks),\
          \ L2 blockchains are pivotal in enabling Ethereum to scale. As a quick refresher,\
          \ there are two types of rollups: Optimistic rollups and ZK rollups. While\
          \ ZK rollups are broadly considered the superior technology, the increased\
          \ complexity of ZKP development, higher compute requirements, and layer\
          \ 1 technological limitations have given optimistic rollups a strong first\
          \ mover advantage. The top three optimistic rollups, [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.foundation/),\
          \ [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), and [Base](https://www.base.org/),\
          \ currently hold 81% of the total L2 market share.\n\nThe tide has begun\
          \ to change, as several notable ZK-rollups went live in 2023. As of 2024,\
          \ the development and implementation of ZK-rollups on Ethereum have advanced\
          \ significantly, showing promising growth and innovation in various projects.\n\
          \nYou can find a list of notable Optimistic and ZK-rollups in the previous\
          \ Blockchain Brief, [Understanding Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks).\n\
          \nWhile optimistic rollups collectively represent the majority of L2 activity\
          \ and TVL, ZK-rollups are quickly picking up steam and are expected to overtake\
          \ their optimistic cousins. Notably, over the last 30 days, [zkSync Era](https://zksync.io/)\
          \ has processed more transactions than Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, and Ethereum\
          \ Mainnet. Both Arbitrum and Optimism have both stated they expect to transition\
          \ their respective chains to ZK-rollups eventually.\n\nThe key takeaway\
          \ here is that the myriad of real-world use cases enabled by ZKPs requires\
          \ a compatible blockchain. That compatibility now exists with the advent\
          \ of ZK-rollups. This, in conjunction with the upcoming [Dencun upgrade](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/27/ethereums-dencun-upgrade-is-a-step-toward-a-scalable-settlement-layer-goldman-sachs/)\
          \ to Ethereum set to launch in the coming months (currently live on testnet\
          \ as of 1/17/24), which will dramatically decrease transaction costs for\
          \ L2s while bringing enhanced security, will not only allow all of these\
          \ use cases to deploy but also allow them to do so cost-effectively at scale.\n\
          \n## Why Policymakers Should Pay Attention\n\nWe live in an increasingly\
          \ digital world. As individuals, private organizations, and governments\
          \ move more of their interactions online, ever more of our most sensitive\
          \ data is put at risk of data breaches and hacks. At a time when faith in\
          \ public institutions is at an [all time low](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/public-trust-in-government-1958-2023/)\
          \ and global ransomware attacks are predicted to [exceed $265B by 2031](https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-250-billion-usd-by-2031/),\
          \ the need for technologies like ZKPs to restore faith in the integrity\
          \ of elections, bolster online security, and protect an individual's right\
          \ to privacy is abundantly clear.\n\nThere are many applications of ZKPs\
          \ that can help balance privacy, security, and regulatory compliance. This\
          \ is especially relevant in the context of global and interoperable blockchain\
          \ technology, where ZKPs can bolster blockchains ability to enhance the\
          \ resilience and accessibility of critical infrastructure and international\
          \ cooperation.\n\n### Challenges in the US Regulatory Environment\n\nThe\
          \ US’s ambiguous regulatory environment is currently driving blockchain\
          \ and ZKP-based technology development overseas. A lack of clear guidelines\
          \ is causing a brain drain in this sector, with developers and companies\
          \ opting for more predictable and supportive environments in countries like\
          \ Japan, Singapore, and parts of the EU. This regulatory uncertainty is\
          \ particularly impactful in the area of decentralized finance (DeFi), where\
          \ traditional frameworks struggle to adapt to the novel nature of blockchain\
          \ technologies.\n\n### ZKPs: A Potential Solution to DeFi KYC\n\nWithin\
          \ this challenging regulatory landscape, the proposed digital assets tax\
          \ reporting regulations in the bipartisan infrastructure bill have defined\
          \ decentralized entities as brokers. This definition is incompatible with\
          \ the decentralized nature of these entities' protocols, as many lack a\
          \ central entity capable of conducting traditional Know Your Customer (KYC)\
          \ practices. The significant compliance and cost burden for startups could\
          \ drive talent offshore, potentially cutting off US users from innovative\
          \ products. Furthermore, the decentralized structure of these platforms\
          \ allows users bypass front-end data collection and access the backend directly.\n\
          \nZero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) emerge as a feasible solution in this context.\
          \ They enable the verification of essential information and reporting through\
          \ smart contracts, all without the need to store sensitive data. By using\
          \ ZKPs, compliance with regulations can be achieved while maintaining a\
          \ balance between privacy, security, and innovation. This technology not\
          \ only minimizes the risk of spreading sensitive data across multiple parties\
          \ but also alleviates the compliance burden for emerging companies. In turn,\
          \ this fosters a healthier environment for technological advancement in\
          \ the US, particularly in the burgeoning field of DeFi.\n\n## Conclusion:\
          \ A Call to Action for Policymakers\n\nAs we navigate the complexities of\
          \ the digital age, Zero-Knowledge Proofs emerge as a powerful tool in preserving\
          \ privacy while ensuring security. Policymakers face the challenge of fostering\
          \ an environment that supports the growth and application of ZKPs while\
          \ protecting consumer rights and privacy. Regulations should be forward-thinking,\
          \ adaptable, and balanced to encourage innovation in this space. The harmonious\
          \ blend of privacy and security that ZKPs provide is not just a technological\
          \ advancement but a step towards a more secure and equitable digital world.\n\
          \nIn conclusion, the potential of ZKPs is vast and multifaceted. From securing\
          \ online transactions to safeguarding AI and machine learning models, they\
          \ offer a solution that strikes a balance between privacy and security.\
          \ As machine learning continues to evolve and our digital footprints expand,\
          \ the role of ZKPs in protecting our digital identities is critical. It\
          \ is imperative for policymakers to understand these dynamics and create\
          \ a regulatory environment that nurtures innovation, protects consumers,\
          \ and maintains the integrity of the financial system. By embracing the\
          \ possibilities of Zero-Knowledge Proofs, we can pave the way for a more\
          \ secure, private, and equitable digital future.\n\n- [Science and Technology](https://5g.wilsoncenter.org/issue/science-and-technology)\n\

          **Unlocking the Potential of Zero-Knowledge Proofs in Blockchain**


          [https://bit.ly/4cqxJvR](https://bit.ly/4cqxJvR)


          **January 26, 2024**


          Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) are becoming a standard within blockchain technology,
          helping to maintain transactional privacy and integrity, highlighting their
          potential to create a more secure and [private blockchain landscape](https://cacm.acm.org/blogs/blog-cacm/258601-blockchain-for-what-exactly/fulltext).


          In this post, we will explore the intricate world of zero-knowledge proofs
          (ZKPs) and their role within the blockchain. The focus will be on the theoretical
          underpinnings and potential applications of ZKPs, examining how they could
          revolutionize privacy in blockchain transactions.


          Additionally, the piece will critically assess the current state of ZKP
          technology, exploring its benefits and limitations, and discussing its future
          possibilities for enhancing blockchain security and privacy.


          ## What is a Zero-Knowledge Proof?


          A zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) is a cryptographic method that is used to prove
          an individual knows a set of data, without revealing what this data contains.
          This form of verification can be extremely effective in scenarios where
          the details of data need to remain private.


          Blockchains are designed to be transparent, but there are many situations
          where privacy is required. For example, smart contracts may contain sensitive
          information such as financial details or personally identifiable information
          that could be used to commit fraud or other criminal activity. To protect
          this information, smart contracts often require specific inputs before they
          can be executed.


          Zero-knowledge proofs have established themselves as one of the primary
          methods to accomplish privacy on a public blockchain. This is achieved by
          one party (the prover) cryptographically proving to another party (the verifier)
          that they possess accurate knowledge of hidden data – data that could only
          be known by the prover with a very high level of certainty.


          In addition to more private blockchain transactions, ZKPs can also help
          [thwart cybercriminals](https://cacm.acm.org/news/262123-darpa-report-finds-vulnerabilities-in-blockchain-tech-non-secure-crypto-transactions/fulltext)
          by adding a layer of security. The importance of such technology is even
          more evident when you consider that [66% of organizations](https://bluetree.ai/cybersecurity-market-growth/)
          have experienced a cyber attack in the past 12 months. This just so happened
          to create the perfect storm, sparking curiosity and bringing the blockchain
          to the limelight once again.


          ## How ZKPs Work


          An advanced-level zero-knowledge proof requires the prover to perform several
          actions that verify the underlying data is known if executed properly. In
          the event of an individual attempting to gain unauthorized access to the
          data, i.e., guessing at the required actions, the verifier’s testing procedures
          will determine that the attempt at providing proof is not legitimate.


          ZKPs can come in two forms, interactive or non-interactive. An interactive
          ZKP requires the prover to repeat the process for individual verifiers each
          time. Meanwhile, a non-interactive ZKP allows the prover to generate proof
          that can be verified by anyone who has knowledge of the same proof.


          The concept of zero-knowledge proofs was initially outlined in the 1985
          MIT paper “ [The Knowledge Complexity of Interactive Proof-Systems](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf),”
          which was written by Shafi Goldwasser and Silvio Micali. The paper outlined
          how it was possible to provide a distinct statement about a data point,
          which could be verified as true, without the need to provide additional
          details.


          Three key characteristics help to define ZKPs:


          - Completeness – If the information or statement provided, and the actions
          taken are correct, then the verifier can determine that the prover possesses
          sufficient knowledge.


          - Soundness – If the information provided is false and the prover is attempting
          to gain unauthorized access then the verifier can easily determine that
          the prover does not know the correct input.


          - Zero-knowledge – In this case, the prover can provide a true statement,
          however, this does not provide the verifier with any additional information
          regarding the correct input.



          ## Types of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


          Zero-knowledge proofs can come in various forms, each having different characteristics
          in terms of proof times, verification times, the size of the proof, etc.
          The most popular ZKPs include:


          1. PLONK – An acronym of “permutations over Lagrange-bases for oecumenical
          non-interactive arguments of knowledge.” PLONK is regarded as one of the
          most trusted and ubiquitous ZKP setups and is compatible with any program,
          while also able to include a large number of participants.


          2. ZK-SNARKS – A “succinct non-interactive argument of knowledge” is small-scale
          and simple to verify. This type of ZKP generates cryptographic proof using
          elliptical curves and requires less computational resources compared to
          a hashing function.


          3. ZK-STARKS – A “scalable transparent argument of knowledge” is a ZKP that
          involves a low level of interaction between the prover and the verifier,
          resulting in a faster speed.


          4. Bulletproofs – This type is a short non-interactive zero-knowledge proof
          that does not need a trusted setup and is suitable for private transactions
          for cryptocurrencies.



          ## Advantages


          A key benefit of ZKPs is their effectiveness when it comes to leveraging
          privacy-preserving datasets within public blockchains or other systems that
          are designed for maximum transparency. This is particularly useful for the
          execution of [smart contracts](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/smart-contracts.asp#:~:text=%25%2025%25%200%25-,What%20Is%20a%20Smart%20Contract%3F,transactions%20are%20trackable%20and%20irreversible.).


          Smart contracts are self-executing programs that automatically perform actions
          that are defined in an agreement between two parties. Once the actions have
          been completed, transactions can be tracked and can’t be reversed, enabling
          visibility. With zero-knowledge proof, users and businesses can execute
          smart contracts on the blockchain, while keeping the stored data private.


          ## Benefits for Institutions


          This is essential for institutions such as banks, financial institutions,
          enterprise-level businesses, and businesses that are part of a wider supply
          chain and must adhere to strict confidentiality when executing smart contracts.
          Such organizations are also legally required to safeguard the Personally
          Identifiable Information (PII) of their clients and comply with regulations
          set out by the countries they operate in.


          ZKPs allow institutions to interact with public blockchain networks that
          have large volumes of users around the world, while still keeping datasets
          private. Without ZKPs, regulated businesses and institutions would need
          to rely on permitted blockchain networks that have far fewer users than
          public blockchain networks.


          This is why ZKP technology is being applied to many institutional use cases
          for public blockchains, resulting in increased accessibility, more efficient
          economies, and innovations. Even institutions like the [London Stock Exchange
          have entered the market](https://tokenist.com/london-stock-exchange-group-to-launch-blockchain-powered-trading-platform/),
          responsible for handling huge volumes of financial data, and are exploring
          the possibility of not just tokenization, but using ZKP to bolster their
          defenses.


          ## Use Cases


          From cybersecurity to Web3 projects, ZPKs have a wide range of use cases.
          Following are three common uses for which the technology is becoming a standard.


          - Private Transactions – An example of a private transaction is one made
          on the [Zcash](https://z.cash/) blockchain, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency.
          By using ZKPs, transactions remain completely private and details such as
          the sender, receiver, and monetary value are not disclosed.


          - Decentralized Identity/ Authentication – ZKPs can play a fundamental role
          in identity management systems that allow users to verify their identity
          while protecting their details.


          - Verifiable Computations – A decentralized oracle network offers smart
          contracts that can access off-chain data and computations that can be combined
          with ZKPs. In this case, the prover can provide a statement about an off-chain
          data point without revealing any data.



          ## Limitations and Future Developments


          The main limitation regarding ZKPs is the hardware, as the technology requires
          graphic processing units (GPUs) that have parallel processing capability
          to reduce the resources and time needed to prove a statement.


          Meanwhile, PLONK uses improved algorithms to provide faster and more effective
          solutions, with similar alternatives expected to be developed in the future.
          However, more abstraction layers also must be developed to complement such
          advancements if the technology is to witness widespread adoption. Although
          the [development landscape](https://cacm.acm.org/news/253536-developers-are-fans-of-blockchain-but-most-have-not-used-it-much-at-work/fulltext)
          is active for ZKPs, the complexity of the technology still provides significant
          challenges.


          From a business standpoint, the implementation of ZKPs and other blockchain
          security technologies has presented some hurdles. With the [increased integration
          of blockchain](https://cacm.acm.org/news/226052-demand-for-blockchain-experts-surges-amid-skills-shortage/fulltext)
          to business platforms, even smaller organizations are [looking for help
          with SAP S4 HANA](https://www.suretysystems.com/insights/how-can-s4-hana-consulting-sap-services-improve-system-efficiency/),
          given the fact that the German giant already [included blockchain into its
          products](https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_BLOCKCHAIN_ADAPTER/c5bee9180afc4a4e93a0742bb352db11/3d17b9c2c38841cd8c56c91342aee048.html)
          for both security and efficiency reasons.


          Fortunately, the infrastructure that powers cryptocurrency is expected to
          evolve rapidly due to the technology’s popularity, causing optimism in ZKP
          circles. There is a significant investment in both consumer-facing cryptocurrency
          platforms and their backend infrastructure, with ZKPs a key consideration
          for creating a decentralized, privacy-first web.


          ## Conclusion


          Zero-knowledge proofs are a rapidly growing technology that is used to ensure
          transactional privacy and integrity on the blockchain. This is key to allowing

          ![](https://orochi.network/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fimages.ctfassets.net%2F937qzezkco6g%2F2sPhXe72rnuvti83ZRE2Wf%2F447d3a9066cfd43eb05e16bdd1c0d5da%2F1.png&w=3840&q=75)Zero-knowledge
          proofs (ZKPs) stand at the forefront of cryptographic innovation, revolutionizing
          how privacy and security are achieved in digital transactions. In this article,
          we delve into the latest advancements shaping the landscape of ZKPs in 2024,
          exploring efficiency enhancements, scalability solutions, privacy-enhancing
          features, and strides towards accessibility and usability.


          ## I. Efficiency Enhancements in ZK Proofs


          Efficiency improvements in ZKPs encompass a spectrum of innovations aimed
          at minimizing computational resources and data requirements while maximizing
          performance and security. These enhancements are pivotal in overcoming barriers
          to adoption, particularly in resource-constrained environments where computational
          power and bandwidth are limited. Among the notable efficiency-enhancing
          advancements are specialized proof systems like Plonkers and Groth16 variants.
          These systems are tailored to specific tasks within the field of zero-knowledge
          proofs, offering significant gains in efficiency compared to general-purpose
          approaches. By optimizing the proof generation and verification processes,
          these specialized systems enable faster and more resource-efficient transactions,
          laying the groundwork for widespread implementation.


          ### 1.1 Plonkers and Groth16 Variants


          Plonkers and Groth16 variants represent a class of specialized proof systems
          designed to address specific use cases within the broader ZKP framework.
          Plonkers, for instance, excel in proving membership in a set or verifying
          computations with unparalleled efficiency. Similarly, Groth16 variants offer
          optimizations for various proof scenarios, enhancing both performance and
          security in ZK transactions.


          ### 1.2 Explanation of Plonkers'' Inner Workings


          Delving into the inner workings of Plonkers reveals a sophisticated yet
          elegant process that underpins its efficiency gains. At its core, Plonkers
          operates through a multi-step protocol involving statement and witness generation,
          commitment ceremonies, challenge generation, response generation, and verification.
          Each step is meticulously orchestrated to ensure the integrity and confidentiality
          of the proof while minimizing computational overhead.


          The process begins with the formulation of a statement, representing the
          information to be proven, and a corresponding witness, encapsulating the
          secret information necessary to validate the statement. These elements are
          then transformed into mathematical commitments, concealing their underlying
          details while preserving their relationships.


          Subsequent steps involve the generation of challenges by the verifier, which
          serve to validate the authenticity of the proof and prevent pre-computation
          attacks. Provers, armed with the commitment and challenge, produce responses
          that, when verified, provide irrefutable evidence of the statement''s validity
          without divulging any sensitive information.

          ### 1.3 Integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Algorithms


          As the specter of quantum computing looms over traditional cryptographic
          primitives, the integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms
          emerges as a crucial strategy for fortifying the security of zero-knowledge
          proofs against future threats.


          ### 1\. 4 Traditional vs. PQC-based ZKPs


          Traditional ZKPs rely on mathematical problems like integer factorization
          or elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) for their security, which may be susceptible
          to attacks from quantum computers. In contrast, PQC-based ZKPs leverage
          algorithms built on different mathematical foundations, such as lattice-based
          cryptography, code-based cryptography, or multivariate cryptography, which
          are believed to be more resilient to quantum attacks.

          alleviate the burden on the Ethereum mainnet, enabling faster and more cost-effective
          transactions.


          The working principle of zkEVMs revolves around the efficient execution
          and verification of EVM code using zero-knowledge proofs. Transactions are
          bundled into batches and processed off-chain, with succinct proofs generated
          to attest to their validity. These proofs are then verified on-chain, ensuring
          the integrity of the transaction history without requiring every computation
          to be executed on the mainnet.


          ### 2.3. Scalability Benefits


          The adoption of zkEVMs offers several compelling benefits for blockchain-based
          applications:


          1\. Improved Throughput: By batching transactions and leveraging zero-knowledge
          proofs, zkEVMs significantly increase transaction throughput, enabling faster
          and more efficient processing.
