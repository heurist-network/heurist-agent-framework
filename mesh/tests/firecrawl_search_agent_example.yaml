            \nThe digital transformation is reshaping numerous sectors of the economy,\
            \ and real estate is no exception. By 2025, AI will no longer be a mere\
            \ gadget but a powerful tool that facilitates customer interactions, streamlines\
            \ decision-making processes, and optimizes sales operations. Simultaneously,\
            \ blockchain technology ensures security, transparency, and scalability\
            \ in transactions. With this article, we launch a series of publications\
            \ exploring AI in business, focusing today on the application of artificial\
            \ intelligence within the real estate industry.\n\n## AI vs. Tradition:\
            \ Key Implementations of AI in Real Estate\n\nDesigning, selling, and\
            \ managing properties—traditional methods are increasingly giving way\
            \ to data-driven decision-making.\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n###\
            \ Breakthroughs in Customer Service\n\nAI-powered chatbots and virtual\
            \ assistants are revolutionizing how companies interact with their customers.\
            \ These tools handle hundreds of inquiries simultaneously, personalize\
            \ offers, and guide clients through the purchasing process. Implementing\
            \ AI agents can lead to higher-quality leads for developers and automate\
            \ responses to most standard customer queries. However, technical challenges\
            \ in deploying such systems include:\n\n- Integration with existing real\
            \ estate databases: Chatbots must have access to up-to-date listings,\
            \ prices, and availability.\n- Personalization of communication: Systems\
            \ must adapt their interactions to individual customer needs.\n- Management\
            \ of industry-specific knowledge: Chatbots require specialized expertise\
            \ about local real estate markets.\n\n### Advanced Data Analysis\n\nCognitive\
            \ AI systems utilize deep learning to analyze complex relationships within\
            \ the real estate market, such as macroeconomic trends, local zoning plans,\
            \ and user behavior on social media platforms. Deploying such solutions\
            \ necessitates:\n\n- Collecting high-quality historical data.\n- Building\
            \ infrastructure for real-time data processing.\n- Developing appropriate\
            \ machine learning models.\n- Continuously monitoring and updating models\
            \ based on new data.\n\n### Intelligent Design\n\nGenerative artificial\
            \ intelligence is revolutionizing architectural design. These advanced\
            \ algorithms can produce dozens of building design variants that account\
            \ for site constraints, legal requirements, energy efficiency considerations,\
            \ and aesthetic preferences.\n\n### Optimizing Building Energy Efficiency\n\
            \nSmart building management systems (BMS) leverage AI to optimize energy\
            \ consumption while maintaining resident comfort. Reinforcement learning\
            \ algorithms analyze data from temperature, humidity, and air quality\
            \ sensors to adjust heating, cooling, and ventilation parameters effectively.\n\
            \n## Integration of AI with Blockchain in Real Estate\n\nThe convergence\
            \ of AI with blockchain technology opens up new possibilities for the\
            \ real estate sector. Blockchain is a distributed database where information\
            \ is stored in immutable \"blocks.\" It ensures transaction security and\
            \ data transparency while AI analyzes these data points to derive actionable\
            \ insights. In practice, this means that ownership histories, all transactions,\
            \ and property modifications are recorded in an unalterable format, with\
            \ AI aiding in interpreting these records and informing decision-making\
            \ processes.\n\n## The Future of AI in Real Estate: Trends and Forecasts\n\
            \nAI has the potential to bring significant value to the real estate sector—estimated\
            \ between $110 billion and $180 billion by experts at [McKinsey & Company](https://www.mckinsey.com/).\n\

            \ years include:\n\n- Autonomous negotiation systems: AI agents equipped\
            \ with game theory strategies capable of conducting complex negotiations.\n\
            - AI in urban planning: Algorithms designed to plan city development and\
            \ optimize spatial allocation.\n- [Property tokenization](https://nextrope.com/tokenization-the-future-of-real-estate/):\
            \ Leveraging blockchain technology to divide properties into digital tokens\
            \ that enable fractional investment opportunities.\n\n## Conclusion\n\n\
            For companies today, the question is no longer \"if\" but \"how\" to implement\
            \ AI to maximize benefits and enhance competitiveness. A strategic approach\
            \ begins with identifying specific business challenges followed by selecting\

            \ New Heights\n\n![](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nGracjan Prusik\n\n11 Mar\
            \ 2025\n\n![AI-Driven Frontend Automation: Elevating Developer Productivity\
            \ to New Heights](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n* * *\n\n## AI Revolution\
            \ in the Frontend Developer's Workshop\n\nIn today's world, programming\
            \ without AI support means giving up a powerful tool that radically increases\
            \ a developer's productivity and efficiency. For the modern developer,\
            \ AI in frontend automation is not just a curiosity, but a key tool that\
            \ enhances productivity. From automatically generating components, to\
            \ refactoring, and testing – AI tools are fundamentally changing our daily\
            \ work, allowing us to focus on the creative aspects of programming instead\
            \ of the tedious task of writing repetitive code. In this article, I will\
            \ show how these tools are most commonly used to work faster, smarter,\
            \ and with greater satisfaction.\n\nThis post kicks off a **series dedicated\
            \ to the use of AI in frontend automation**, where we will analyze and\
            \ discuss **specific tools, techniques, and practical use cases of AI**\
            \ that help developers in their everyday tasks.\n\n## AI in Frontend Automation\
            \ – How It Helps with Code Refactoring\n\nOne of the most common uses\
            \ of AI is improving code quality and finding errors. These tools can\
            \ analyze code and suggest optimizations. As a result, we will be able\
            \ to write code much faster and significantly reduce the risk of human\
            \ error.\n\n**How AI Saves Us from Frustrating Bugs**\n\nImagine this\
            \ situation: you spend hours debugging an application, not understanding\
            \ why data isn't being fetched. Everything seems correct, the syntax is\
            \ fine, yet something isn't working. Often, the problem lies in small\
            \ details that are hard to catch when reviewing the code.\n\nLet’s take\
            \ a look at an example:\n\n``` line-numbers\nfunction fetchData() {\n\
            \    fetch(\"htts://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\")\n      .then((response)\
            \ => response.json())\n      .then((data) => console.log(data))\n    \
            \  .catch((error) => console.error(error));\n}\n```\n\nAt first glance,\
            \ the code looks correct. However, upon running it, no data is retrieved.\
            \ Why? There’s a typo in the URL – \"htts\" instead of \"https.\" This\
            \ is a classic example of an error that could cost a developer hours of\
            \ frustrating debugging.\n\nWhen we ask AI to refactor this code, not\
            \ only will we receive a more readable version using newer patterns (async/await),\
            \ but also – and most importantly – AI will automatically detect and fix\
            \ the typo in the URL:\n\n``` line-numbers\nasync function fetchPosts()\
            \ {\n    try {\n      const response = await fetch(\n        \"https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts\"\
            \n      );\n      const data = await response.json();\n      console.log(data);\n\
            \    } catch (error) {\n      console.error(error);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n\
            ## How AI in Frontend Automation Speeds Up UI Creation\n\n**One of the\
            \ most obvious applications of AI in frontend development is generating\
            \ UI components.** Tools like [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot),\
            \ [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) can\
            \ generate component code based on a short description or an image provided\
            \ to them.\n\nWith these tools, we can create complex user interfaces\
            \ in just a few seconds. Generating a complete, functional UI component\
            \ often takes less than a minute. Furthermore, the generated code is typically\
            \ error-free, includes appropriate animations, and is fully responsive,\
            \ adapting to different screen sizes. It is important to describe exactly\
            \ what we expect.\n\nHere’s a view generated by [Claude](https://claude.ai/)\
            \ after entering the request: “Based on the loaded data, display posts.\
            \ The page should be responsive. The main colors are: #CCFF89, #151515,\
            \ and #E4E4E4.”\n\n![Generated posts view](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n\
            ## AI in Code Analysis and Understanding\n\nAI can analyze existing code\
            \ and help understand it, which is particularly useful in large, complex\
            \ projects or code written by someone else.\n\n**Example: Generating a\
            \ summary of a function's behavior**\n\nLet’s assume we have a function\
            \ for processing user data, the workings of which we don’t understand\
            \ at first glance. AI can analyze the code and generate a readable explanation:\n\
            \n``` line-numbers\nfunction processUserData(users) {\n  return users\n\
            \    .filter(user => user.isActive) // Checks the `isActive` value for\
            \ each user and keeps only the objects where `isActive` is true\n    .map(user\
            \ => ({\n      id: user.id, // Retrieves the `id` value from each user\
            \ object\n      name: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`, // Creates\
            \ a new string by combining `firstName` and `lastName`\n      email: user.email.toLowerCase(),\
            \ // Converts the email address to lowercase\n    }));\n}\n```\n\nIn this\
            \ case, AI not only summarizes the code's functionality but also breaks\
            \ down individual operations into easier-to-understand segments.\n\n##\
            \ AI in Frontend Automation – Translations and Error Detection\n\nEvery\
            \ frontend developer knows that programming isn’t just about creatively\
            \ building interfaces—it also involves many repetitive, tedious tasks.\
            \ One of these is implementing translations for multilingual applications\
            \ (i18n). Adding translations for each key in JSON files and then verifying\
            \ them can be time-consuming and error-prone.\n\nHowever, AI can significantly\
            \ speed up this process. Using [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com/), [DeepSeek](https://www.deepseek.com/),\
            \ or [Claude](https://claude.ai/) allows for automatic generation of translations\
            \ for the user interface, as well as detecting linguistic and stylistic\
            \ errors.\n\n**Example:**\n\nWe have a translation file in JSON format:\n\
            \n```json line-numbers\n{\n  \"welcome_message\": \"Welcome to our application!\"\
            ,\n  \"logout_button\": \"Log out\",\n  \"error_message\": \"Something\
            \ went wrong. Please try again later.\"\n}\n```\n\nAI can automatically\
            \ generate its Polish version:\n\n```json line-numbers\n{\n  \"welcome_message\"\
            : \"Witaj w naszej aplikacji!\",\n  \"logout_button\": \"Wyloguj się\"\
            ,\n  \"error_message\": \"Coś poszło nie tak. Spróbuj ponownie później.\"\
            \n}\n```\n\nMoreover, AI can detect spelling errors or inconsistencies\
            \ in translations. For example, if one part of the application uses \"\
            Log out\" and another says \"Exit,\" AI can suggest unifying the terminology.\n\
            \nThis type of automation not only saves time but also minimizes the risk\
            \ of human errors. And this is just one example – AI also assists in generating\
            \ documentation, writing tests, and optimizing performance, which **we\
            \ will discuss in upcoming articles**.\n\n## Summary\n\nArtificial intelligence\
            \ is transforming the way frontend developers work daily. From generating\
            \ components and refactoring code to detecting errors, automating testing,\
            \ and documentation—AI significantly accelerates and streamlines the development\
            \ process. Without these tools, we would lose a lot of valuable time,\
            \ which we certainly want to avoid.\n\nIn the next parts of this series,\
            \ we will cover topics such as:\n\n- [**How does AI speed up UI component\

            In the past thread on ZKPs or Zero-Knowledge, we spoke at length about
            what ZKP is all about and how it has revolutionized scaling of the [decentralized](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/)
            ecosystem. In this thread today, we shall look at the projects which have
            been stimulating the adoption of zero-knowledge proof. Though the majority
            of the L2s have preferred optimistic [rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/rollups/)
            because their architecture is quite simple to deploy when compared to
            a ZKP, we shall look at a few projects which have done unparalleled work
            to allow ZKPs to rise with time.


            ## Top Projects on ZKPs to Drive  Enterprise Level Adoption of Blockchain


            ### 1- StarkEx


            [Enterprises](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/why-is-private-blockchain-network-suitable-for-enterprise/)
            are desperately vying to deploy the decentralization aspect in their modus-operandi,
            but it is the scalability and secrecy which has hindered adoption. StarkEx,
            a Layer 2 or L2 scaling solution has endeavored to improve scalability
            and privacy of the [blockchains](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/a-detailed-guide-on-blockchain-node-infrastructure)
            through the introduction of SNARKs or zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive
            argument on knowledge.


            StarkEx uses lightweight cryptographic hash-functions that helps in restoring
            computational integrity which is pivotal for scaling the [blockchain ecosystem](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/quintessential-beginners-guide-to-baas-blockchain-as-a-service). 
            For example, suppose if we transcend in time and look at mainstream adoption
            of blockchain where we see [decentralized](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/)
            ATMs competing with TradFi. At such times, the need for computational
            integrity will be felt at the maximum.


            Building an entire ecosystem that ensures computation without the intervention
            of a third party but with the same level of trust requires futuristic
            computational prowess. StartEK has already achieved that through its battle-tested
            integration of ZK-starks that do not require a trusted third party to
            set up the ZKP systems. Hence, it is being widely used by exchanges and
            [DeFi protocols](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/) to scale
            their ecosystem. At the moment, DiversiFi and DyDx have used StarkEx to
            scale up their operations with minimum gas costs and higher scalability.


            However, the trade-off of StarkEX is the computational Integrity bolstering
            commerce. Though most of the [public blockchains](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/)
            do achieve this; they compromise the scalability and privacy of operations.


            ### 2- StarkNet


            Composability with the Ethereum chain is a pressing concern that has obstructed
            the adoption of ZK technology in business operations. Most businesses
            have trusted the [Ethereum Network](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)
            for its decentralization, security and hack-proof track record. However
            they do have a concern while hosting their operations on the main-chain.
            StarkNet, a general purpose ZKP allows faster deployment of dApps on its
            ecosystem. StarkNet pushes for integrity  of computation through the use
            of level 2 cryptographic proofs and modern Algebra.


            On top of this, StarkNet is also providing the same composability level
            as [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)
            allowing developers to further speed up the development process and come
            up with advanced solutions as and when required. Along with this, StarkNet
            provides true anonymity by not letting the user’s identity be derived
            from public keys and supporting multi-calls or multiple transactions in
            one single call to settle the accounts. Hence it significantly reduces
            flow of data from the off-chain computational layer to the main parent
            chain, which is [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/).


            ### 3- Miden


            [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            has been leading by example when it comes to developing and building ZKP
            projects to make sure that their dream of onboarding the next billion
            users to Ethereum doesn’t go unanswered. For that reason, [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            Technologies have directed all the focus towards scaling the Ethereum
            chain. Their $1 billion corpus investment to develop revolutionary ZK
            projects like Miden, Hermes, Zero and Nightfall have already steered their
            ambition towards the right direction.


            Miden, which was rolled out in 2021 is already making headlines. As a
            STARK based ZKP, Miden aims to provide 1,000 to 2,000 TPS which shall
            move higher to even 20,000 TPS once sharding goes live on [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/).
            Miden will cut dependency on third party validators with ready to deploy
            solutions. At the same time, it will be using lean cryptography which
            would make it resilient to quantum attacks in the near future. The Miden
            Virtual Machine will support arbitrary programs which will eliminate cryptographic
            complexities and allow developers to quickly design and deploy the system.


            Such an upside is decisive for the adoption of ZKP because the narrative
            that floats at present is developing the ZKP solution is complex and commands
            a lot of resources. Through Miden, [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            aims to solve that complexity by introducing Solidity compatible EVM [smart-contracts](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/smart-contract-standardization-a-necessity-for-the-large-scale-adoption-of-blockchain/)
            streamlining quick deployment.


            ### 4- Polygon Zero


            [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            Zero is another ambitious project which shall outsmart all other ZKPs
            that are capable of scaling TPS. The Plonky2 recursive SNARK will take
            only 170 milliseconds for generating a recursive proof to the transaction.
            Due to such a feature, ZERO ZKPs will be giving very tough competition
            to its competitors in terms of latency and fees.


            They would be much lower since the blobs of data will be created and destroyed
            in no time to free up space and reduce toxic waste  for better  scaling 
            the Ethereum base layer.


            Another trade-off of the Zero ZKP is its ability to run solidity codes
            transpiled into ZK Bytecodes making it compatible with the Ethereum ecosystem
            and ensure quick deployment of the solution.


            ### 5- Polygon Hermez


            There’s a new buzzword lately in the crypto scape: Zk EVM or Zero Knowledge
            Ethereum Virtual Machine. Since Hermez has already achieved unprecedented
            feats by becoming the very first decentralized ZKP on [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)
            mainnet, Hermez 2.0 is poised to further solidify that claim. Under Hermez
            1, Polygon has already touched 2,000 TPS, but there’s more room for improvement
            that Hermes 2 will accomplish.


            Right at the moment, developers have to face real challenges when allowing
            ZKP to directly communicate with the Ethereum mainnet. Or put simply,
            one has to develop everything from scratch which adheres to EVM compatibility.
            Hermez 1.- ZkEVM will execute Ethereum transactions in a fully decentralized
            and transparent way.


            Once this would roll, it would eliminate users and Dapp frictions that
            happen when interacting with ZKPs and the main-layer of [ETH](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/).
            Hermez 2.0 will be using the proof-of-efficiency( P-o-E) because the P-o-D
            or Proof-of-Donation model was vulnerable to attacks at the bootstrapping
            levels. Since if a donating verifier goes rogue, it leads to a delay.


            Hence the team chose the PoE model since it ensured permissionless opportunity
            to produce the L2 batches and kept the right balance between overall validation
            effort and the value in the network. Furthermore, Hermez 2 also introduces
            zkASM which helps in taking complete control in the development and design
            of the architecture in the manner that the project demands, instead of
            an already cookie cutter approach provided. In this way, new projects
            need not have to struggle since they already have a pre-built infrastructure
            from where they can make adjustments and scale up their operations. These
            aspects make Hermez 2.0 a revolutionary solution for scaling the projects
            while maintaining the same degree of security provided by the Ethereum
            mainchain.


            ### 6- Polygon Nightfall


            At the moment, Optimistic roll ups have been deployed across 75% of [DeFi](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/banking-the-unbanked-defi-promoting-financial-inclusion/);
            but they do struggle with the withdrawal time which is seven days. Polygon’s
            core aim is to give very high grade security and scalability solutions
            to [enterprises](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/8-emerging-enterprise-blockchain-trends-to-follow-in-2022/).
            Hence they came up with Nightfall which will introduce the perfect amalgamation
            of ZKPs and Optimistic roll-ups to impart privacy, scalability and gas
            cost optimization to the users.


            The privacy preserving roll-ups that [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            has introduced in Nightfall only reveal the time and date of the transaction.
            Whereas, the [optimistic rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/appchains/optimistic-rollups/)
            assume every transaction to be valid; however, it does allow the challenging
            period to validate the authenticity of the transaction. In this way, Polygon,
            through Nightfall, has been instrumental towards empowering SCM or [Supply
            Chain](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/transforming-supply-chain-finance-with-blockchain)
            Management, [NFT](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/dynamic-nfts-new-world-for-nfts)
            markets and blockchain mixers to scale up their operations. Ernst & Young
            E & Y is already in talks with Polygon and they have empowered EY Opschain
            and EY Blockchain Analyser using the Polygon Nightfall ZKPs.


            ### 7- Metis


            Metis has been another key driver from the [Polygon](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-polygon-blockchain/)
            family which has been designed in such a way to help optimistic roll-ups
            occupy center stage when it comes to scaling the ETH’s base layer. As
            you can see in the opening of this blog, Vitalik Buterin, the founder
            of [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)
            has been quite favoring ZKPs when compared to [Optimistic rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/appchains/optimistic-rollups/).


            His major concern however  was the withdrawal time for funds since optimistic
            roll-ups take more than 7 days and by that time, the funds are locked
            within the [smart-contract](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/smart-contract-standardization-a-necessity-for-the-large-scale-adoption-of-blockchain/).
            The objective of Metis ZKP is to completely disrupt that model with a
            new noble solution.


            In the new validation model as proposed by the Metis ZKP, there will be
            a multi-party fraud detection system. Due to this mechanism, an additional
            layer of security will be created while finalizing the transaction which
            is called the Metis Ranger System.


            Under the Metis Ranger system, the validators/rangers are given specific
            blocks as samples. These rangers first audit the transaction and provide
            validity proofs first-in hand before the mainchain validators can challenge
            the transaction. Due to this process, the validation and withdrawal times
            that took weeks on the layer 1’s or mainchain could be completed in hours
            and minutes to scale up the use of optimistic [rollups](https://www.zeeve.io/rollups/)
            in scaling requirements.


            ### 8- ZK Sync


            What’s the biggest challenge in the blockchain space? Answering to the
            blockchain trilemma: (i) Decentralization (ii) Security (iii) Scalability.
            If you deep dive into L1s, all of them face the same challenge. Though
            Algorand claims to have solved the Trilemma, yet the claims remain subject
            to contention since everyone can become a validator on PPoS consensus
            of Algorand but the Round Robin validator selection goes to the highest
            staker.


            ZKs have solved the scalability challenges but their process remains much
            debatable. For example, most of the validators cannot participate in validating
            the entire transaction volume. As a result of this, the problem of censorship,
            DD-o-S and centralization looms larger.


            Through [ZkSync](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-zksync-era-node/),
            a new way of validating the transaction will be made possible.. There
            will be validators and guardians with the validators given the role to
            pack the transaction in batches and they need to submit security bonds
            which are always higher than the txs they validate. In this way, it makes
            the transactions safe. At the same time, to check that validators do not
            go rogue by controlling the network, the guardians who are majority [token](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/comprehensive-guide-on-tokenized-real-world-assets/)
            holders choose the validators in random manner.


            These guardians need not have to run the computation on high-end computing
            devices. They can choose to control a fraction of the network with even
            a basic laptop; thus making the process of validation completely decentralized
            due to no entry barrier. On top of this, they are also not eligible for
            slashing, hence more people would join to make the ecosystem completely
            decentralized. That’s how [ZKSyncs](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-zksync-era-node/)
            are functioning to provide true [decentralization](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/),
            security and scalability to the main chains.


            ### 9- Loopring


            Loopring has been instrumental towards simplifying trading in cryptocurrencies
            with a complete non-custodial and highly anonymous set-up for traders.
            The project also aims to solve the challenges of liquidity, scalability
            and user experience through the use of ZKP. In the Loopring operational
            mode, in order to scale DEX or [Decentralized](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/use-cases-of-blockchain-in-decentralized-storage/)
            Exchanges, Loopring is introducing a hybrid model of ZKP.


            In the Hybrid ZKP model offered by Loopring, order-messaging will be handled
            off-chain, whereas, and settlement will happen on-chain on a real-time
            basis with no delays.


            Loopring will use the ZKP that will relay information to the mainchain
            by the prover that they have done some computation. The Merkle-trees will
            display the complete transaction history and a smart-contract will be
            checking the same to provide real-time data sets to the mainchain for
            recording transactions.


            In this way, Loopring aims to completely revolutionize trading through
            DEX where the order model will be fast, efficient,  economical and completely
            non-custodial in nature. Along with this, Loopring introduces the standalone
            exchange contracts which will make transactions completely secretive providing
            adequate privacy to the users; thus allowing different DEXes to cooperate
            using the ZKP model to exchange information and execute trades. They can
            do so using the same exchange contract which shall stimulate liquidity
            and faster settlements as and when required to scale decentralized exchanges.


            ### 10- Mina


            Though we say that [Ethereum](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-ethereum-blockchain/)
            and [BItcoin blockchains](https://www.zeeve.io/blockchain-protocols/deploy-bitcoin-blockchain/)
            are heavily decentralized, they come with a downside for those who want
            to run the full-nodes. They need to download the complete full node from
            the Genesis Block to the day they wish to run the [full-node](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/what-is-a-full-node-a-detailed-guide/).
            This creates an entry barrier since Bitcoin blockchain has a 437 GB block
            size and Ethereum has 1 TB. Mina ends up as an amenable choice to resolve
            this problem.


            It is the world’s lightest blockchain running a 22KB block. To ensure
            scalability and high throughput, the Mina blockchain uses the Ouroboros
            Samasika consensus mechanism that uses a modified [PoS](https://www.zeeve.io/blog/a-complete-guide-on-proof-of-stake-pos-in-cryptocurrency/)
            model. However, to further scale the ecosystem, Mina uses the SNARK mechanism
            to validate the transactions. However this SNARK is unlike the others
            talked about.


            The SNARK validators open a SnarketPlace. On the Snarketplace, they publish
            the ZK proofs on the Snarketplace and block producers  will be bidding
            for the Snark Proofs. The most competitive bid wins the auction and they
            need to share a part of their block produced rewards with the SNARK workers/validators.
            In this way, the system remains truly decentralized, scalable and incentivizing
            for anyone to enter and exit the system.


            Mina has envisaged a new economic model which maintains anonymity, economic
            incentives and even scales the ecosystem through the use of ZKPs.


            Stay Tuned since we will be posting more threads that shall cover all
            other nuances of ZKPs and how they will shape the future of blockchain.

            # 01\. Introduction


            In a digital age rife with data breaches and online vulnerabilities, building
            trust is more crucial than ever. Zero knowledge proofs (zk proofs) offer
            an elegant solution beyond traditional privacy measures by allowing one
            party to verify certain information without ever disclosing the information
            itself.


            Experts say zk proofs have the potential to revolutionize various industries,
            from fniance and healthcare to luxury fashion and decentralized systems
            like blockchain, ushering in a new era of security and assurance. Independent
            research shows that zk proof generation will become a $$ 10$ billion market
            by the year 2030. Web3 services will require almost 90 billion zk proofs
            to be performed in 2030, with market-wide completion of 83,000 transactions
            per second.


            This report will cover some familiar zk proof territory, including the
            differences between zk-STARKs and zkSNARKs, a timeline of innovations
            in this space, challenges and future projections. The focus, however,
            is today’s exciting infelction point where zk proofs are moving from research
            projects to serious business – an analysis derived from new and fristhand
            accounts from leading companies within the ecosystem of $2 5 0 +$ companies
            that form the Protocol Labs innovation network. With a shared mission
            to shape the future of computing, PL companies — including CryptoNet,
            Gensyn, Ingonyama, Lurk Lab, Polybase, Rarimo, StarkWare, Zama — have
            contributed to the world of zk proofs for years and will share their exclusive
            insights in this report.


            Companies like Lurk Lab zero in on the complex mathematical models that
            form the basis of zk proofs. They believe the zk proof space is poised
            for growth:


            “There’s been a decade of work to improve zk protocols that are leading
            to real business – we’re even seeing boutique venture capital firms that
            exclusively invest in this space. We are at an inflection point of better
            technology and more capital moving towards zk proofs," said John Burnham,
            cofounder of Lurk Lab. "It’s a Cambrian explosion.”


            This report features exclusive research and expert commentary on the properties
            of zk proofs, use cases, challenges, potential disruptors, signs of momentum
            and future outlook.


            # 益 INGONYAMA


            Ingonyama, a PL network team that solves for hardware limitations by building
            semi-conductors to accelerate zkSNARKs, stresses the importance of privacy
            in the next iteration of the internet:


            ![](https://www.protocol.ai/images/722213d150008d9ac4b6cda16d916f2604c7927f11ca799b11443efcd4ac882c.jpg)


            Elan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama


            “Information is the most valuable currency in the world. Yet we are all
            guilty of oversharing our data to third parties on the internet. Today
            if you want to prove one aspect of yourself, such as age, you must upload
            an ID which contains so much extra information —  full name, address,
            country of citizenship, etc. What happens to that data? Often we find
            it''s been leaked or stolen. This scenario happens every day in the digital
            world. The problem of oversharing can be solved by zk proofs, which are
            the most powerful cryptography that exists today for hiding data, while
            allowing for assertions on that data. ZK proofs are considered one of
            the greatest achievements of cryptography in the last 50 years.”


            # 02\. What are ZeroKnowledge Proofs?


            Picture this:


            You’re driving in an upscale neighborhood and spot the perfect house.
            You dial the realtor’s number, ready to hear the asking price. What if
            there was a way to prove to the realtor right away that you’re good for
            the money — no matter the cost — without revealing the total amount in
            your bank account? You could maintain your financial privacy and put in
            an offer right away.


            Here enters the concept of a zero knowledge proof (zk proof). In this
            scenario, you present a zk proof to confirm you have enough funds for
            the down payment without revealing your entire bank balance or personal
            wealth. By establishing trust without unnecessary disclosures, zk proofs
            find practical application in various daily scenarios — ensuring secure
            digital transactions, verifying identity without exposing sensitive data,
            and revolutionizing privacy in the digital age.


            In 1985, Shafi Goldwasser, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff first introduced
            the concept of zk proofs to the world. Years later, one of their mentees,
            Rosario Gennaro, a researcher and former data scientist at Protocol Labs,
            wrote a highly cited paper about more efficient, publicly verifiable computer
            schemes that is still relied on today. He shares an example of a zk proof
            with a technical explanation here:


            # Step by Step Example of a ZK Proof


            step 01.


            ![](https://www.protocol.ai/images/152cf0b602e7f6999a5fc37368623ece281f81ca40034b6a131a1a59c7ab457d.jpg)


            ![](https://www.protocol.ai/images/59a50b819bc9b9815ca53729aa78c3b0863c249416a4963eda324e0e8e6a77d8.jpg)


            # Setup


            Emily and David agree on the secret vault''s combination, but they want
            to ensure that Emily truly knows it without exposing it.


            # Prover (Emily)


            Emily takes on the role of the prover. She uses a zk proof technique to
            demonstrate her knowledge of the combination without revealing what it
            is. Instead of showing the combination directly, she performs a series
            of cryptographic operations that prove she possesses the knowledge.


            # step 04.


            ![](https://www.protocol.ai/images/5bb8a3291d18057072c52a871b177af7de0ed6a25177c70df54e687ed2ce7fdf.jpg)


            # step 03.


            ![](https://www.protocol.ai/images/f7308043612d592b4ae884ca975d06c10b8da8e32d7a2029c9b10d81f0877aea.jpg)


            # Proof Generation


            Emily follows David''s instructions using the knowledge she has without
            revealing the combination itself. She provides the result of her operations
            to David.


            # Verifeir (David)


            David is the verifeir in this scenario. He wants to be convinced that
            Emily actually knows the combination. David challenges Emily by asking
            her to prove her knowledge. He provides specifci instructions, such as
            asking her to perform operations on the combination without revealing
            it.


            # step 05.


            # Verifciation


            David checks Emily''s response. If it''s correct based on the instructions
            he provided, he becomes convinced that Emily knows the combination without
            actually learning the combination himself. If Emily didn''t know the combination,
            it would be highly improbable for her to consistently provide correct
            responses based on David''s instructions.


            In this example, the prover (Emily) demonstrates her knowledge of the
            combination to the verifeir (David) without revealing the actual combination.
            This showcases the core concept of zk proofs, where one party can prove
            knowledge of certain information without disclosing that information to
            the other party, ensuring privacy and security in various applications
            like authentication and cryptography.

            privacy using zk proofs.


            2014


            Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency, adopts zk-SNARKs to enable private
            transactions.


            1992


            Oded Goldreich, Silvio Micali, and Charles Rackoff develop the concept
            of interactive zk proofs, where the verifeir can interact with the prover
            to increase confidence in the proof.


            2002


            Jan Camenisch and Markus Stadler introduce the concept of group signatures
            with effciient zk proofs, allowing members of a group to anonymously sign
            messages while maintaining the integrity of the group.


            2012


            Computer scientist Eli Ben-Sasson announces the concept of zk-SNARKs.


            2018

            zkSync, a layer-2 scaling solution for Ethereum using zk rollups, gains
            attention.


            2021


            Cairo, a programming language for zk-SNARKs, is introduced by StarkWare,
            simplifying the development of zk-rollup solutions.


            A Note on zk-SNARKS vs zk-STARKS


            # 2020


            Filecoin mainnet launches as a decentralized storage network and cryptocurrency.
            Filecoin is currently the largest deployed zk-SNARK to date. By 2023,
            the Filecoin network produces 6-7 million zk-SNARK proofs daily, each
            proof encompassing over 100 million arithmetic constraints.


            # 2022


            The zkSync project releases zkSync 2.0, a new zk rollup that is designed
            to be more effcient and scalable than previous zk rollups.


            Two cryptographic techniques, created in tandem, fall under the umbrella
            of zk proofs: zk-SNARKs and zk-STARKs. Both aim to achieve similar goals
            of proving the validity of statements without revealing the underlying
            data, but they differ in their underlying mechanisms and use cases~


            v zk-SNARK is a type of zk proof that allows a prover to demonstrate the
            truth of a statement to a verifeir in a succinct and non-interactive manner.
            It''s particularly associated with privacy-preserving transactions in
            blockchain and cryptocurrency systems, like Zcash.


            v zk-STARK is another type of zk proof that also allows for proving the
            validity of statements without revealing the underlying data. Though it
            requires interaction, it achieves better security by removing the need
            for trusted setups, unlike zk-SNARKs.

            # 04\. Current Major Use Cases


            ZK proofs have found diverse applications across various feilds due to
            their unique ability to verify information without revealing the underlying
            data. Here are fvie major use cases:


            # Voting Systems


            In a zk proof-based voting system, voters can prove that their vote is
            valid without revealing the actual choice they made. This maintains the
            secrecy of individual votes, while ensuring that the total count is accurate.
            Similar to the way they are used today by DAOs, zk proofs can be used
            to verify properties of the election process, such as the absence of double
            voting or the integrity of the tally, without revealing specifci voter
            information.


            # Cryptocurrencies


            Zcash may be the most notable cryptocurrency dedicated to preserving privacy
            – and zk proofs play a crucial role. They enable confdiential transactions
            where the sender, receiver, and transaction amounts are hidden, while
            still ensuring the validity of transactions. ZK proofs can also verify
            the correctness of smart contracts without revealing the underlying data.


            # Decentralized Finance (DeFi)


            Research shows that the DeFi market is growing rapidly and consistently,
            nearly doubling each year since 2018. According to data, the market is
            set to reach $$ 67.4$ billion by 2026. This translates to corresponding
            growth in the zk proof space, as DeFi platforms leverage zk proofs to
            enhance privacy and scalability.


            ZK proofs are used to validate transactions and operations off-chain,
            while providing cryptographic proof of their correctness on-chain. This
            reduces the computational load on the blockchain and speeds up transaction
            processing. ZK proofs can also be used in decentralized exchanges to prove
            that users possess the necessary funds for trading without disclosing
            their exact balances.


            Since 2019, when DeFi was relatively new, its quarter-on-quarter growth
            has risen at a rapid rate, with over 6 million unique wallets completing
            an onchain transaction each month since late-2022.

            # Supply Chain Transparency and Traceability


            ZK proofs can be used to verify and authenticate the origin, movement,
            and authenticity of products within a supply chain without revealing sensitive
            proprietary information. This can enhance transparency by allowing different
            entities to independently verify the accuracy of claims made about products,
            such as their source, quality, and journey through the supply chain. For
            example, zk proofs could be employed to prove that a product was ethically
            sourced, without disclosing proprietary supplier data.


            # Environmental Standards


            ZK proofs can be applied to verify compliance with environmental standards
            without revealing sensitive business data. For instance, companies can
            demonstrate that they meet certain emissions reduction targets without
            sharing specifciemission levels or proprietary information. This aids
            in maintaining transparency and accountability while protecting sensitive
            information.


            # Polybase


            Powered by zk proofs, Polybase is a layer 2 blockchain with private transactions
            and MEV-resistance. A member of the PL innovation network, Polybase’s
            co-founder Sid Gandhi shares an example of an energy use case in the real
            world.


            ![](https://www.protocol.ai/images/57a8faafaa160f7634285ed48d3ad4b533286e6cd57772b1b119a5e5f7d90a4a.jpg)


            Sid Gandhi, co-founder of Polybase “One of the largest European energy
            companies wants to offer transparent data around renewable energy generation.
            Rather than quarterly manual audits, we look at real time data being generated
            from renewable resources. What percentage of the energy generated and
            sent to this particular client is green? Doing that in a cryptographically
            verifaible way isn''t really possible. Consider data centers that don''t
            want to reveal second-by-second energy data that they are consuming –
            that can be used for competitive intelligence.


            What we allow with zk is the ability to keep that private data private,
            but then prove some public attributes of that data. So we could prove
            points like: what percentage of the data generated at this particular
            time is renewable? That''s a very motivating use case for us, because
            that solves a real problem in the real world that we''ve seen with real
            customers. It''s really exciting for us to be able to tackle this problem.”


            # 05\. 4 Exciting Bets in ZK Proofs


            In the evolving landscape of zk proof technology, there are several projects
            and cutting-edge techniques that are pushing the boundaries of what''s
            possible, with a primary focus on enhancing effciiency, scalability, and
            usability. These innovative efforts are not only shaping the future of
            zk proofs, but also working towards broader adoption across various domains.


            As these projects continue to mature and gain traction, the potential
            for zk proofs to revolutionize industries beyond cryptocurrency becomes
            increasingly evident, offering a promising future where privacy and security
            are paramount in our digital interactions.


            Research shows that


            6 The zk proof market is projected to reach $$ 75$ million in revenue
            in 2024,


            6 Has the potential to exceed $$ 10$ billion in revenue by the year 2030,


            6 Web3 applications alone are expected to require almost 90 billion zk
            proofs in 2030,


            6 The average market clearing price per proof is expected to fall from
            $$ 0.21$ in 2024 to $$ 0.12$ by 2030


            To that end, here are four big bets designed to increase adoption, including
            three top projects and one important technique that is helping build more
            effciient, scalable zk proof systems.


            # zkEVM


            A concept within the Ethereum ecosystem aimed at developing a zk proof
            system that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It
            involves various stakeholders, including developers, researchers, and
            the Ethereum community. This would allow zk proofs to be used for a wide
            variety of Ethereum applications.


            # 2 zkSync


            A method and project focused on developing zk rollups, a type of layer
            2 scaling solution for Ethereum. ZK rollups use zk proofs to bundle multiple
            transactions together, verify them off-chain, and then submit a single
            proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This signifciantly reduces the computational
            load on the Ethereum network and enhances its scalability. Examples8


            ^ zkSync is also the name of a specifci project that has been developed
            to implement this method. It is initiated and maintained by Matter Labs,
            a company focused on improving the scalability and usability of blockchain
            networks. The zkSync project includes the development of the zkSync protocol,
            smart contract infrastructure, and associated toolsA


            Emerging zk rollups, such as zkSync Era, have witnessed a growth in their
            total value locked (TVL) surging to $$ 668$ million in June 30, 2023,
            according to Crypto.com.  This signifeis an impressive $6 6 0 %$ increase
            from $$ 88$ million on April 1, 2023A


            Research shows that the Total Value Locked (TVM) in ZK rollups is currently
            over $$ 7.5 B$ to date. Mid-September 2021 saw all scaling solutions adoption,
            including zk rollups, skyrocket:

            # 3 zk-STARKs


            There''s exciting development around this proof system that is even more
            efficient and scalable than previous systems. This could make zk proofs
            practical for a wider range of applications.


            Recursive zk proofs


            A technique that allows for the aggregation of multiple proofs into a
            single proof, drastically reducing the computational overhead of verification.
            This innovation has contributed to improved scalability in zk proof systems,
            making them more efficient for applications with a high transaction volume. 
            Usually, the way it is used is in evolving computation: First, it breaks
            the computation to be proven into smaller steps and proves them iteratively.
            Each step contains a proof, proving the current state of the computation.
            Then, a new proof for the next step can be generated by using the current
            step and its proof recursively showing the correctness of all prior steps
            alltogether. The proof update does not require recomputing from the very
            first step as in a standard zk proof, and it is independent of the total
            length of the computation.

            to the blockchain with over $1 trillion of cumulative trading done to

            “The beneftis of recursion will be realized gradually, as it continues
            to allow for new improvements, and it will soon deliver hyper-scale, cut
            gas fees, and improve latency by unlocking the potential of parallelization.
            Further optimization of the Recursive Verifeir is on-going and even better
            performance and cost beneftis are expected to be provided over time.”

            # ZK x AI and Machine Learning (ZKML)


            ZK proofs applied to machine learning, a sub-field of AI, hold particular
            promise. As AI-generated content becomes increasingly indistinguishable
            from human-created content, zero knowledge cryptography could be used
            to verify that a specific piece of content was produced by a specific
            LLM. This could be done by creating a zero knowledge circuit representation
            of the model, which would allow the content to be verified without revealing
            the model itself or any of the input data.

            (ZKML) where it has two interesting use-cases: reducing compute verification
            overheads (e.g. for Machine Learning Compute Protocols like Gensyn), or
            proving that a given Machine Learning model has been applied (e.g. a fraud

            and on-chain gaming. Moreover, the use of zk proofs is accelerating due
            to the urgency with which identity credentials are needed both within
            Web3 and Web2 as AIgenerated bots and deep-fakes make it increasingly
            diffciult to discern humans – and human-generated content – from machines
            and AI-generated content.”


            # 07\. Challenges & Hurdles


            ZK proofs offer exciting possibilities for privacy, security, and efficiency.
            However, they also come with several technical challenges and adoption
            barriers for researchers, developers, and practitioners working in the
            realm of zk proofs. These multifaceted issues range from efficiency and
            scalability limitations to concerns about security assumptions and real
            world implications. By addressing these challenges, the cryptographic
            community can pave the way for the broader utilization of zk proofs in
            domains ranging from blockchain and cybersecurity to privacypreserving
            technologies and beyond. Here are five challenges currently in focus:


            Many zk proof systems involve the use of sophisticated cryptographic operations
            applied to a complex mathematical representation of a computer program.
            This complexity can make it challenging for developers to adopt and integrate
            zk proofs into their applications. It also affects the efficiency and
            scalability of large-scale zk systems.


            ![](https://www.protocol.ai/images/fb5421daeedb061e8120870a026a84e8145c131a0091a8bf99630f53ab0bc37f.jpg)


            “The main challenge is around the balance of cost, time and proof size.
            This is the Holy Grail: to generate a proof with zero overhead and super
            small proof size. Now, we have achieved super small proof sizes, but with
            other big trade-offs. Generally the trade-off is: it becomes more expensive.”


            # Scalability


            While zk proofs can aggregate multiple proofs and transactions, scalability
            challenges can arise when dealing with a high volume of transactions.
            Generating and verifying a large number of proofs may introduce bottlenecks.
            Achieving strong privacy guarantees through zk proofs might involve trade-offs
            in terms of transaction speed, network overhead, or computational load.
            Striking the right balance between privacy and performance is crucial.


            Research scientist Rosario Gennaro explains that building a zk proof involves
            running a program that stores the state of the virtual machine at every
            step of the proof, making space a bottleneck to growth and speed of transaction.
            Folding schemes present a solution for proofs that are computed at every
            step of a computation: given a proof with correct computation up to, for
            example, step 4, the next correctness proof is obtain by "folding" the
            proof of correctness of step 5 into the previous proof, without the need
            to store the state of the computation at every stage.


            “Instead of writing the entire transcript for the computation down at
            each step, folding compresses the computation and solves the space problem.
            There is a lot of work happening on implementing folding schemes to build
            effciient zk virtual machines, ranging from Web2 companies like Microsoft
            to cutting edge startups like Lurk Lab. While this bottleneck hasn’t been
            fully resolved, it’s one area where we are ahead of the curve to solve
            the issue and defniitely an area to watch.”

            # 3 Trusted Setup


            Some zk proof systems require a trusted setup phase to generate initial
            parameters. The trusted setup phase requires that the individuals or entity
            responsible for generating these parameters act honestly and do not keep
            any secret information that could compromise the security of the system.
            If this setup is compromised or not performed correctly, it can undermine
            the security and privacy guarantees of the system. The field of zk proofs
            is rapidly evolving, with new advancements and potential vulnerabilities
            regularly emerging. Continuous research and development are essential
            to address security issues and improve the efficiency of zk proof systems.


            # Interoperability


            Different zk proof systems might use distinct standards and protocols,
            making it challenging to achieve interoperability between different systems.
            Creating common standards would enhance compatibility and efforts are
            currently underway with the likes of The ZKProof Community. ZK proofs
            also often come with proof sizes that can be large, making them less efficient
            to transmit and store. Efforts to minimize proof size while maintaining
            security are ongoing. To support standardization, Polybase has released
            a new zk benchmark site,  [https://zkbench.dev/](https://zkbench.dev/),
            with detailed comparison tables and open community reviews.


            # Polybase

            Sid Gandhi, co-founder of Polybase “We''re at that phase in the industry
            where people understand the high level capability, like keeping data private,
            proving things publicly, but there is still a big educational aspect around
            the trade-offs and the technical implementation, and, potentially, what
            other options are available, what trade-offs exist with those options
            as well. So, we are doing quite a bit of education. And then, the next
            step after that is selling our actual product. So it''s a two-step process
            right now.”


            Hardware acceleration techniques, such as using trusted execution environments
            (TEEs) or specialized hardware like ASICs, have enabled faster and more
            effciient computation of zk proofs. This breakthrough has the potential
            to make zk proofs practical for real-time applications.


            # INGONYAMA


            ![](https://www.protocol.ai/images/29f853f49ca3214ad5600fa7864b1314cc41b382a63fc4b3e998c2266f6f650e.jpg)


            Elan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama


            “Today''s hardware is not built for zero knowledge. ZK proofs require
            a massive amount of computational resources and existing hardware (CPUs,
            GPUs) are not designed to handle this computation effciiently. The main
            bottleneck is proof generation, which is still too slow and expensive.
            In terms of timing, zk algorithms have been developed for four decades,
            and zk software engineering for about 10 years. The missing ingredient
            is specialized hardware in order to accelerate proof generation, which
            is needed in order to commoditize the technology and make it accessible
            to everyone.


            ZK proof generation must be an order of magnitude faster than it is today
            for real world use-cases. And that''s what we''re working on. Most of
            the demand today comes from the blockchain industry for scaling and privacy,
            but what makes me even more excited for zk proofs is the fact that once
            we get outside of the Web3 ecosystem, zk can impact nearly every industry,
            from medical research to AI, to decentralized ID, to new online multiplayer
            gaming architectures, and beyond.”


            # 08\. The Future of ZK Proofs


            # Seamlessness


            The industry is evolving at a rapid pace, with a focus on moving from
            research to a business-led model. On one hand, the near future is focused
            on addressing challenges and roadblocks in this space, which include hardware
            acceleration and faster computation. Here, PL network teams share their
            top three projections for the zk proof space in the near future.


            In the next 2-5 years, Rarify Labs expects an era of widespread integration
            of zk proofs across multiple protocols and technologies. Its presence
            will revolutionize privacy, digital identities, and blockchain performance,
            all while being seamless and mostly invisible to users, similar to the
            way SSL and secure enclaves in phones are invisible to users. ZK technology
            will have a user-centric folw that enables scaling and accessibility across
            the digital identity space.


            ![](https://www.protocol.ai/images/93240bae4837b2d87747a0adf013f1b49b4facf9671433903e6d3ee27d3f0c07.jpg)


            “ZK proofs will help dissolve the boundaries between Web2 and Web3, particularly
            within the identity space as it is currently the only technology that
            sits across both realms. More generally, zk proofs will massively reduce
            computation complexity and help deliver truly performant blockchains.”


            Client side integration


            In the ever-evolving landscape of cryptography, Ingonyama believes zk
            proofs will transcend server-side applications and find their place within
            the very devices we carry in our pockets. Imagine the power of a world
            with zk proof hardware embedded directly in your mobile device, capable
            of running a proof of ownership or proof of personhood.


            “We envision a future in which zk is not just running on the server side
            like data centers and cloud, but also on the client side – in mobile phones
            and gaming machines. ZK technology is fundamental to trustless compute.
            We''re working to make efficient, zk proof hardware accelerators that
            can run everywhere.” said Elan Neiger, marketing lead at Ingonyama.

            # Cost efficient proofs


            As zk proof methods evolve and proofs themselves become smaller in size
            and more cost effective, they will become an attractive option within
            the realm of the Internet of Things (IoT). Currently, IoT devices store
            all their data in centralized storage and data is stored directly onto
            their servers. ZK proofs allow for proofs to be used in place of stored
            data, creating efficiencies and cutting costs.

            Elan Neiger, head of marketing, Ingonyama


            “Another focus for the future of zk lies with the Internet of Things (IoT).
            With zero knowledge, it will be possible to cut the costs of data storage,
            by sending proofs instead of data to confirm that specific stages or conditions
            have been met. Zero-Knowledge also allows for yes /  no answers to complex
            questions involving data or sensitive personal information. For example:
            do you have enough money in your bank account to buy this car - Yes or
            no?  ZK today is still a small market, but growing, because it is the
            most powerful cryptography that exists for hiding data, while allowing
            for assertions on that data.”


            Education and standardization are key to the evolution of zk proofs. To
            that end, Ingonyama launched an open source community effort in August
            2023: Ingopedia, a repo for all things zk for beginners and experts, ranging
            from video tutorials to academic research (link). Ingopedia has been widely
            cited as a good place to dive into the deep end of zero knowledge.


            # Potential Disruptors


            As the industry evolves, researchers and developers are keeping an eye
            out for potential disruptors. These include quantum computers, homomorphic
            encryption and interdisciplinary innovations:


            If large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computers become a reality, they
            could potentially break certain cryptographic primitives that underpin
            zk proofs. However, should quantum computing become a reality, we will
            have to change all the deployed cryptographic schemes. There is already
            great progress with quantum-resistant encryption to date and industry
            leaders are making strides with quantum resistant SNARKs as well.


            “All is not lost with the advent of quantum computing. In the future,
            we will see quantum resistant SNARKs. We know how to do quantum resistant
            encryption at this point. Should a quantum computer show up tomorrow,
            it will change everything. It won’t happen overnight, but we''ll get there.”

            # Homomorphic Encryption


            Fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) allows computations to be performed
            on encrypted data without the need to decrypt it. FHE and zk proofs serve
            different roles in cryptography, and their use cases often complement
            each other rather than disrupt each other. While FHE can be used for secure
            computation and privacy-preserving data analysis, zk proofs are typically
            employed for proving statements about data or knowledge without revealing
            that data or knowledge. However, if zk proofs over FHE computations were
            deployed, it could enable a new level of privacy-preserving computation,
            where not only the data, but also the operations performed on the data
            remain hidden. This would have significant implications for secure cloud
            computing, private data analysis, and more.


            Actively building in this space, PL network team Zama is building an open
            source framework that enables developers to use homomorphic encryption
            to secure their Web2 and Web3 apps, without having to know cryptography.
            The homomorphic programs can then be deployed locally, to the cloud or
            to their upcoming decentralized infrastructure.

            Rand Hindi, co-founder of Zama


            “While zk’s strength is in verifiability, FHE focuses on privacy. When
            you combine the two together, you have the ideal solution, because you
            can have confidential computing that is actually verified. And so it''s
            an area we’re very excited about. But zk has difficulty scaling existing
            tech. The way you implement zk is complicated, you have to resort to incredibly
            complex protocols. By contrast, FHE is just a smart contract running on-chain,
            like every other smart contract. But again, FHE cannot do what zk does,
            which is to prove that a computation is correct. This is why the future
            will likely see compatibility between the two, with zk for verifiability
            and FHE for privacy.”

            # Interdisciplinary Innovations


            As the adoption of zk proofs expands, experts from various fields may
            come together to create novel applications and protocols. For example,
            collaborations between cryptographers, blockchain developers, AI researchers,
            and economists could lead to innovative solutions that we can''t foresee
            yet. This cross-pollination of ideas might result in entirely new use
            cases and disruptive applications for zk proofs.

            Harry Grieve, Co-Founder of Gensyn “Platforms will mature to the point
            where they’re ready for production use and then (hopefully) many applications
            will start appearing beyond the current under-the-hood/ scalability systems
            like zkEVMs or the current iteration of Starknet. We’re most excited about
            the applications in machine learning.”


            Recommendations & Advice


            # Stay Updated with Research


            Zero knowledge proofs is an evolving field with constant advancements.
            Stay updated with the latest research papers, conferences, and discussions
            in cryptography and related domains to remain informed about new techniques
            and developments.


            # Experiment and Prototype


            Start by experimenting with existing zk proof libraries and tools. Creating
            prototypes will give you hands-on experience and help you grasp the practical
            aspects of using zk proofs. Collaborate with other researchers, developers,
            and experts in the field. It''s a great way to learn the strengths and
            limitations of different zk proof systems.


            # Focus on Real-World Applications


            While theoretical research is important, also consider practical applications.
            Think about how zk proofs can solve real-world problems like privacy-preserving
            data sharing, secure authentication, or improving blockchain scalability.

            “After many years, we fnially have effciient proof schemes. By effciient,
            I mean that the prover time versus the normal computation time is getting
            closer and closer. The closer we get, the more we can have more applications
            that can be verifeid. In 2023, it''s close enough to verify blockchain
            transactions. And maybe in the future, it can be closer to verify any
            computation.”

            Recursive proofs: A type of proof that involves using a zk proof as a
            building block within another zk proof, allowing for more complex and
            layered privacy-preserving computations.


            R1CS (Rank-1 Constraint System): This is a mathematical framework used
            to represent computations as a set of constraints, making it possible
            to construct zk proofs for a wide range of applications, including blockchain
            and privacy-preserving protocols.


            Linear prover time: Refers to the desirable characteristic of zk proofs
            where the time it takes to generate a proof is directly proportional to
            the complexity of the computation being proven, making them efficient
            for practical use cases.


            PlonK: A highly efficient zk proof system that stands for "Permutations
            over Lagrange-bases for oecumenical noninteractive arguments of knowledge,"
            known for its scalability and performance in cryptographic applications.


            zk-STARK: (Zero knowledge Scalable Transparent Arguments of Knowledge)
            is a type of zk proof that offer transparency and scalability while allowing
            one party to prove the knowledge of certain information without revealing
            that information itself.


            zk-SNARK: (Zero knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge)
            is a class of zk proofs that enable one party to prove to another that
            they possess certain information without revealing the information itself,
            while also being highly efficient and requiring minimal interaction.


            Proof size: The amount of data required to represent and transmit a zk
            proof, which is a critical factor in assessing the efficiency and practicality
            of a zk proof system.


            Verifier time: The computational effort required by a verifier to verify
            the validity of a zk proof, which is important for assessing the practicality
            and efficiency of a zk proof system.


            ZKML: (Zero knowledge Machine Learning) is a concept that combines machine
            learning techniques with zk proofs to enable the training and utilization
            of machine learning models without exposing the underlying data used for
            training.


            zkEVM: A concept within the Ethereum ecosystem aimed at developing a zk
            proof system that is compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
            It involves various stakeholders, including developers, researchers, and
            the Ethereum community. This would allow zk proofs to be used for a wide
            variety of Ethereum applications.


            zkSync: A method and project focused on developing zk rollups, a type
            of layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. ZK rollups use zk proofs to
            bundle multiple transactions together, verify them off-chain, and then
            submit a single proof to the Ethereum mainnet. This signifciantly reduces
            the computational load on the Ethereum network and enhances its scalability.


            ZK rollup: A type of Layer 2 scaling solution for Ethereum. zk rollups
            use zk proofs to bundle multiple transactions together, verify them off-chain,

            # Zero-Knowledge Proofs: Emerging Opportunities for the Insurance Industry


            October 2023


            ### **Authors**


            Stefano Chiaradonna (Ph.D. Candidate)


            Petar Jevtić, Ph.D. (PI)


            Dragan Boscovic, Ph.D. (Co-PI)


            ### Description


            Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) represent an innovative suite of cryptographic
            algorithms that empower various parties, especially the insurance community,
            to validate the accuracy of sensitive information without revealing the
            actual information itself. When implemented, it could help the insurance
            industry authenticate policyholders and beneficiaries more efficiently,
            faster and, with fraud prevention mechanisms, it could facilitate communication
            with distribution channels, reinsurers or other stakeholders. Industry
            standards have not yet emerged and various technological solutions offer
            various tradeoffs. Thus, this report introduces the diverse applications
            and emerging opportunities that ZKPs offer to the insurance community,
            especially in the health insurance space.

            ## Description


            Research on blockchain has found that the technology is no silver bullet
            compared to traditional data structures due to limitations regarding decentralization,
            security, and scalability. These limitations are summarized in the blockchain
            trilemma, which today represents the greatest barrier to blockchain adoption
            and applicability. To address these limitations, recent advancements by
            blockchain businesses have focused on a new cryptographic technique called
            "Zero-knowledge proofs". While these primitives have been around for some
            time and despite their potential significance on blockchains, not much
            is known in information systems research about them and their potential
            effects. Therefore, we employ a multivocal literature review to explore
            this new tool and find that although it has the potential to resolve the
            trilemma, it currently only solves it in certain dimensions, which necessitates
            further attention and research.

            # What is Zero-Knowledge Proof - a hot technology bringing trustworthiness
            to Web3 privacy?


            Recently, "zero-knowledge proof" is attracting attention. In 2019, the
            World Economic Forum announced zero-knowledge proof as one of the five
            privacy-enhancing technologies that bring new value to the financial sector
            (\*1). Why is this idea, invented in the 1980s, receiving attention now?
            This article gives an overview of the technology, examples of its application,
            and looks into its future.

            ## What is Zero-Knowledge Proof?


            Zero-knowledge proof; ZKP is a technology in which a person who wants
            to prove something (Prover; hereafter referred to as P) proves the fact
            that he knows the knowledge without giving any other knowledge to the
            person who wants to verify it (Verifier; hereafter referred to as V).


            As a result, V can only verify the fact that P knows the knowledge without
            obtaining any other knowledge (Figure 1).


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img01.png?h=378&iar=0&w=800&rev=6d7d71ac7c564b25984a2df33508640b)


            Figure 1: Concept of Zero-Knowledge Proof



            In the real world, when you want to assert that you hold certain credentials,
            it is common to present evidence to convince the other person that you
            hold the credentials.


            However, when you do so, the other person may be presented with too much
            information about what you want to prove, such as your address or age
            in the evidence. If you cannot trust the other person, you may feel uncomfortable
            giving them too much information. However, if you don''t show them the
            evidence, they are unlikely to trust your claim. How can you convince
            someone that you hold the qualification without giving them extra information?


            The technology to achieve this is zero-knowledge proof. The idea of zero-knowledge
            proof originated in cryptography research in the 1980s (\*2).


            - (\*2) [Goldwasser, S., Micali, S., Rackoff, C.: "The knowledge complexity
            of interactive proof-systems," STOC 1985.](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/22145.22178)



            The claims that can be proven with zero-knowledge proof are knowledge
            about propositions. A proposition is a verbal expression of a judgment
            that is clearly true or false (\*3).


            - (\*3)

            For example, "2023 is equal to 7×17×17" is a proposition, and it is a
            true fact. "I know the prime factorization of 2023" is knowledge related
            to the stated proposition and is an example of a claim that can be used
            for zero-knowledge proof. On the other hand, "2023 is a large number"
            is subjective and not a proposition. Therefore, the claim that "I know
            2023 is a big number" is not a subject of zero-knowledge proof.



            In general, a zero-knowledge proof must satisfy three properties: completeness,
            soundness, and zero-knowledge (Table 1).


            | Nature | Overview |

            | --- | --- |

            | Completeness | If the prover is correct, it will be determined to be
            correct by the verifier |

            | Soundness | If the prover is incorrect, it must be determined to be
            incorrect by the verifier with a high probability |

            | Zero-Knowledge | The verifier cannot obtain any knowledge other than
            the fact that the prover wants to prove |


            Table 1: Requirements for a zero-knowledge proof


            ## Intuitive understanding of Zero-Knowledge Proofs


            Here are two examples to help you understand zero-knowledge proofs intuitively.


            ### 1\. The cave problem


            This explanation was introduced in the paper "How to explain zero-knowledge
            protocols to your children" (\*4).


            - (\*4) [Jean-Jacques Quisquater et al., "How to Explain Zero-Knowledge
            Protocols to Your Children," CRYPTO 1989. (PDF: 227KB)](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~mkowalcz/628.pdf)


            Inside the cave is a magic door that opens when you say the password.
            The prover P knows the password and gives it in exchange for money. The
            door is at the far end of the cave shown in Figure 2. There are two paths
            to the door, A and B. The person who knows the password can open the door
            and move from A to B or vice versa.


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img02.jpg?h=453&iar=0&w=800&rev=cf4c7228935441d3b38f0fd9442af117)


            Figure 2: The Cave Problem



            V, the verifier, wants to buy the password, but he doubts whether P really
            knows the password and cannot start a transaction. If P can convince V
            that P knows the secret password without telling V the secret password
            itself, V can start a transaction. So, here''s what they are trying to
            do.


            First, V waits outside the cave. Then P enters the cave, randomly chooses
            either path A or B, and goes to the door (Figure 3).


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img03.jpg?h=533&iar=0&w=800&rev=0918e3fa17984bbe8d735ff3c9df3166)


            Figure 3: Prover P''s Random Selection



            Next, V enters the cave, goes to the branching point of the paths, randomly
            chooses A or B in their head, and shouts to P to come out from the chosen
            path (Figure 4).


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img04.jpg?h=401&iar=0&w=800&rev=945bfc0651e54daea0b604e2edd6f2a4)


            Figure 4: Verifier V''s Random Selection



            If P knows the password:


            P can use the password to open the door and come out of the designated
            path, whichever way V tells him to go (Figure 5). This means completeness.


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img05.jpg?h=466&iar=0&w=800&rev=6088ed6bec1c4fd3a3ac05b15c69a53a)


            Figure 5: The Case that Prover P Knows the Password



            If P does not know the password:


            P can only come out of the path he entered, so the probability of coming
            out of the path chosen by V is 50%. If they repeat this process over and
            over again, it''s almost impossible for P to fool V every time (Figure
            6). For example, if they try 30 times, the probability that P can fool
            V is about 0.0000001%. This means soundness.


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img06.jpg?h=421&iar=0&w=800&rev=db7f0b94506a47679157cddc1b1a33bf)


            Figure 6: The Case that Prover P Does Not Know the Password



            So, if P succeeds on all his attempts, V must be convinced that P knows
            the password. If V tries even more, he can get his chance of being cheated
            as close to 0% as V wants. At this time, V will not gain any knowledge
            about the password. This means zero-knowledge.


            Literally, what P wants to prove has been proved to V with zero-knowledge.


            ### 2\. The Problem of Finding a Seabird


            Professor Amit Sahai of the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)
            explains the concept of zero-knowledge proof on YouTube to children, teenagers,
            college students, graduate students, and experts in five different difficulty
            levels (\*5). Here is a child-friendly explanations that will help you
            get a sense of the main points.


            - (\*5) [Computer Scientist Explains One Concept in 5 Levels of Difficulty,
            WIRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOGdb1CTu5c)


            The professor shows the child a picture. The picture shows a crowd of
            hundreds of penguins. He says, "There is one puffin (a penguin-like seabird),
            and I know where it is, but I don''t want to tell you. Do you believe
            me? I''m going to prove it without revealing its location."


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img07.jpg?h=505&iar=0&w=800&rev=3f05fc0c1f934735a75fbbae8353800f)


            Figure 7: The Problem of Finding a Seabird



            The professor pulls out a piece of black paper several times larger than
            the photo. The paper has a small hole, and the photo is pasted on the
            back of the paper so that the hole matches the position of the puffin.
            The child looks into the hole and says, "I see a puffin". But the child
            can''t see the position of the photo on the back of the paper, so she
            can''t tell where the puffin is in the original photo. "This is an example
            of a zero-knowledge proof," the professor explains (Figure 8).


            ![](https://www.nttdata.com/global/en/-/media/nttdataglobal/1_images/insights/focus/what-is-zero-knowledge-proof/img08.jpg?h=370&iar=0&w=800&rev=46de5598e3f64c609c0c7fd1a156c661)


            Figure 8: Zero-Knowledge Proof for the Problem of Finding a Seabird



            This exchange satisfies completeness because a professor who knows the
            location of the puffin can always prove it.


            Furthermore, it satisfies soundness because if the professor does not
            know the location of the puffin, the cheating will be exposed with a high
            probability if the child looks into the hole and confirms it.


            Furthermore, it satisfies zero-knowledge because the child cannot obtain
            any knowledge other than the fact that the professor knows the location
            of the puffin.


            ## Social Application Examples


            This paper introduces an application example of zero-knowledge proof to
            society and considers prospects.


            ### 1\. Blockchain Privacy Enhancement


            Blockchain is widely used in society, a representative example being virtual
            currencies. Its transparency is maintained by decentralized management
            of its ledger by all participants in the blockchain. However, due to its
            high transparency, securing user privacy may be a challenge.


            In recent years, zero-knowledge proofs have begun to be used to improve
            blockchain privacy. For example, in the case of cryptocurrencies, methods
            known collectively as zk-SNARK (\*6) and zk-STARK (\*7) have begun to
            be introduced as zero-knowledge proofs to show that the transaction operation
            was indeed performed, without disclosing the transaction contents such
            as the sender, recipient, and remittance amount.


            In addition, zero-knowledge proofs have attracted even more attention
            because they can contribute to speeding up blockchain processing.

            - (\*7)

            ### 2\. Proof of Income Range


            In November 2017, ING, a major Dutch bank, developed zero-knowledge range
            proofs (ZKRP) (\*8). ZKRP is an application of zero-knowledge proofs.
            ZKRP can prove that a numerical value, such as an amount of money, is
            within a certain range without showing the numerical value to the other
            party. For example, mortgage applicants can prove that their income is
            within a certain range required by loan screening without telling the
            income itself.


            - (\*8)[ING launches Zero-Knowledge Range Proof solution, a major addition
            to blockchain technology](https://www.ingwb.com/en/insights/distributed-ledger-technology/ing-launches-major-addition-to-blockchain-technology)


            ### 3\. Selective Disclosure of Attribute Information


            The W3C, which standardizes Web technologies, has standardized a data
            model for the concept of verifiable credentials (VC) (\*9). It introduces
            zero-knowledge proof, in which you select your attribute information and
            prove only that the attribute satisfies certain conditions.


            For example, it shows a use case in which you select and prove only the
            information that a university graduate received a degree without revealing
            his or her identity or other unnecessary personal information.


            - (\*9) [W3C Recommendation, Verifiable Credentials Data Model v1.1, 2022.](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#zero-knowledge-proofs)



            VC is currently being discussed in the "Trusted Web" initiative led by
            the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan. It shows the expectation of zero-knowledge
            proof as a method to realize selective disclosure of data(\*10).


            - (\*10) [Secretariat of the Headquarters for Digital Market Competition,
            the Cabinet Secretariat of Japan, "Trusted Web White Paper Ver 2.0, Overview"
            August 2022 (PDF: 1.7MB)](https://www.kantei.go.jp/jp/singi/digitalmarket/pdf_e/Trusted_Web_White_Paper_ver2.0_Overview.pdf)


            ### 4\. User Authentication


            Currently, ID and password authentication is mainly used for websites
            of various services. However, since the string length of a password is
            limited to a range that can be remembered or managed by the human brain,
            it is vulnerable to brute-force and password-list-type attacks.


            Furthermore, if an attacker takes over the server, not only the password
            itself, but also information useful for guessing the password is leaked,
            which becomes a hint for the attacker, and the password may be leaked
            in the future. If user authentication is implemented with zero-knowledge
            proof, the server can be more secure because no information related to
            the password exists from the beginning.


            As a zero-knowledge proof that can be applied to user authentication,
            there is the Schnorr protocol (\*11). In this method, knowledge about
            the solution of a mathematically difficult problem called the discrete
            logarithm problem is assumed to be information that only the user can
            know and is authenticated with zero-knowledge proof. Compared with the
            ID and password method, this method has not been adopted in the world
            for many years due to its disadvantages such as high communication volume,
            slow processing speed, and "The size of the data to be kept secret is
            too large for humans to remember."


            - (\*11) [IETF, RFC 8235, Schnorr Non-interactive Zero-Knowledge Proof,
            September 2017](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8235)


            In recent years, however, with the spread of technologies such as "faster
            communication networks," "faster processing speeds of servers and terminals,"
            and "memory areas that can be securely stored in smart cards and smartphones,"
            conventional disadvantages are going to be no longer disadvantages.


            ## Prospect


            In recent years, the term "Web3" has attracted attention, and although
            there are various interpretations, its constituent concepts are said to
            be centered on "blockchain," "decentralization" and "decentralized ID."
            Application cases (1) and (2) mentioned above are measures to improve
            the privacy of blockchain, and (3) and (4) are related to decentralization
            and decentralized ID. Therefore, zero-knowledge proof can be said to be
            "a technology that brings trustworthiness to the privacy of Web3."


            In the future, zero-knowledge proof will become an essential technology
            for safe and secure future societies that require a high level of privacy.


            NTT DATA will continue to keep up with the latest trends and accumulate
            and disclose know-hows.

            Top Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proof Crypto Projects of 2025


            # Top Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proof Crypto Projects of 2025


            Intermediate


            Last Update April 1, 2025


            ![Top Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Proof Crypto Projects of 2025](https://assets.staticimg.com/reaper-image/663ca291b16963000196221a_Top%20Zero-Knowledge%20%28ZK%29%20Proof%20Crypto%20Projects%20of%202024-16-9.jpg)


            Zero-knowledge proofs are cryptographic methods that enable one party
            to prove to another that a statement is true without revealing any information
            beyond the validity of the statement itself. Here’s a look at some of
            the best zero-knowledge proof (ZKP) crypto projects in the market.


            Imagine being able to prove you know a secret without ever having to reveal
            it. This is the essence of Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), a revolutionary
            concept in the blockchain and crypto landscape that enhances privacy and
            scalability. As we delve deeper into 2024, ZKPs are increasingly crucial
            due to their ability to execute transactions or prove knowledge without
            exposing any underlying data.


            Zero-knowledge proofs have been gaining traction for their role in addressing
            the dual challenges of privacy and scalability in blockchain technologies.
            They are particularly significant in an era where digital privacy concerns
            are peaking, and the demand for efficient, scalable blockchain solutions
            is critical. Their growing application across various crypto projects
            in 2024 underlines their potential to reshape the blockchain ecosystem.


            ## What Are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)?


            Zero-knowledge proofs allow a "prover" to convince a "verifier" that they
            know a value or that a statement is true without revealing any information
            beyond the statement''s validity. This process hinges on three critical
            properties:


            - **Completeness:** If the prover''s statement is true, the verifier will
            be convinced by the proof without any doubt.


            - **Soundness:** If the statement is false, no cheating prover can convince
            the verifier of its truthfulness, except with negligible probability.


            - **Zero-Knowledge:** The verifier learns nothing other than the fact
            that the statement is true, gaining no further information from the proof.



            The benefits of using ZKPs in cryptocurrency projects are manifold. They
            enhance privacy by enabling transactions where no sensitive information
            is disclosed. For example, in voting systems, they can confirm a user''s
            eligibility without revealing their identity. They also improve scalability
            through constructions like [zk-Rollups](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/crypto/top-ethereum-zk-rollup-projects),
            where transaction data is processed off-chain and only the validity proof
            is stored on the blockchain, thereby reducing the data load and speeding
            up transaction times.


            Consider the often-cited "Ali Baba cave" analogy for a more interactive
            understanding. Here, a person proves they know the secret to opening a
            hidden door inside a cave without revealing the secret itself. They do
            this by performing actions that are observable (like emerging from the
            correct door), but the secret phrase itself is never disclosed.


            This concept is not just theoretical; it''s already being implemented
            in significant projects for secure transactions, identity verification,
            and more, all without compromising the privacy of any party involved.


            **Here’s a deep dive into [zero-knowledge proof (ZKP)](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/crypto/zero-knowledge-proof-zkp-explained)
            technology and how it works.**


            ## Use Cases for Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) in Blockchain


            Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are transforming how blockchain technology
            manages privacy and data integrity. Here''s how they''re being applied
            across various crypto projects and blockchain-based applications:


            1. **Financial Privacy:** ZKPs enable transactions where the validity
            of a transaction is confirmed without revealing any information about
            the transaction itself. This is crucial in cryptocurrencies like Zcash,
            where users can choose to hide transaction details such as the sender,
            recipient, and amount transferred while still maintaining a secure and
            verified ledger.


            2. **Scalable Blockchain Solutions:** Projects like zkSync and StarkWare
            utilize ZKPs to increase [blockchain scalability](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/crypto/blockchain-layer-1-vs-layer-2-scaling-solutions-explained).
            They use a technique called zk-Rollups, where transaction data is processed
            off-chain, and only the validity proofs are submitted to the blockchain.
            This drastically reduces the data load on the main chain, enabling faster
            and cheaper transactions.


            3. **Secure Voting Systems:** ZKPs can be used to ensure the integrity
            and anonymity of votes in electronic voting systems. They allow voters
            to prove their vote was counted without revealing who they voted for,
            providing privacy and transparency in the voting process.


            4. **Authentication Without Passwords:** In systems that require authentication,
            ZKPs can verify the identity of a user without the need to transmit a
            password or any other sensitive information. This method prevents attackers
            from intercepting passwords during transmission, enhancing the security
            of online platforms.


            5. **Supply Chain Traceability:** ZKPs can help verify the authenticity
            of products in a supply chain without revealing underlying trade secrets
            or confidential business information. For instance, a company could prove
            that its products meet certain environmental standards without disclosing
            its suppliers or detailed manufacturing processes.


            6. **Confidential Smart Contracts:** Platforms like [Aleph Zero](https://www.kucoin.com/price/AZERO)
            and [Mina Protocol](https://www.kucoin.com/price/MINA) are exploring the
            use of ZKPs to execute smart contracts that keep certain inputs and outputs
            private. This is particularly valuable in business contexts where contract
            details are sensitive and should not be publicly disclosed on the blockchain.

            Polygon Hermez aims to improve scalability and efficiency for Ethereum,
            making blockchain technology more accessible and sustainable for widespread
            use. It uses a unique consensus mechanism known as Proof of Efficiency
            (PoE), designed to maintain network security and decentralization while
            being less vulnerable to the complexities and potential attacks associated
            with the earlier Proof of Donation (PoD) system. Recent advancements include
            the integration of Hermez into Polygon’s ecosystem, reflecting a strategic
            move towards enhancing Ethereum’s scalability using zero-knowledge technology.


            Key features of Polygon Hermez include substantial reductions in transaction
            costs—over 90% compared to Ethereum’s [mainnet](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/mainnet)—and
            significant throughput improvements, supporting the network''s scalability.
            However, challenges such as the complexity of ZK proofs and the need for
            specialized knowledge to implement and optimize these technologies could
            pose barriers to adoption. Looking forward, Polygon Hermez is set to continue
            evolving, focusing on enhancing its technology to better serve a growing

            ### Mina Protocol (MINA)


            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/Mgi2FQJoUFwuclcw-mnzyuYN0hpcCBa4YyBu4B3qlzF2VQsNzGzXZ55ZseD4LCg_XgPG1uUjzkMB4QyF9f1jazmnUChcUV-mb5fMLSiw15JSVDnnS76t1VFB-pKzVXVxuUYtezqeyYTk_GJGSfdkxlg)


            Mina Protocol (MINA) stands out as a blockchain that focuses on true decentralization
            by maintaining a consistent, minimal blockchain size of only 22KB. This
            is achieved using Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of
            Knowledge (zk-SNARKs). This technique enables Mina to compress entire
            blockchain states into small snapshots, allowing any user to quickly verify
            the network''s state without needing to download a large blockchain history.
            This approach not only ensures greater accessibility but also reduces
            reliance on powerful intermediaries, thus preserving the decentralized
            nature of the blockchain.


            Mina''s mission is to streamline blockchain participation by making it
            as lightweight as possible, ensuring that anyone can verify the network
            right from their devices. This is achieved through its unique zk-SNARK
            technology, which updates with each new block, continuously compressing
            the blockchain''s history into a small proof. Mina also employs the Ouroboros
            Samisika [proof-of-stake](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos)
            [consensus mechanism](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/consensus-mechanism),
            which is less resource-intensive than traditional [proof-of-work](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/proof-of-work-pow)
            systems. Recent updates within the Mina ecosystem include advancements
            in [node](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/node) performance and
            the introduction of zkApps, which allow for [off-chain](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/off-chain)
            computation and enhanced privacy for [smart contracts](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/smart-contract).
            However, the innovative approach of using zk-SNARKs for all state transitions
            can introduce complexities in maintaining and developing on such a unique
            platform​.

            ### dYdX (DYDX)


            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/XehLmBzyLH3SkIzzJcsOSoyRK-Di7yLOK5pFqCmitHBoR-DtmYkvuNmBpU4l44oP9MTmukenBC92-pvRvJ1hqHCjTFsNKTVkZyNIQvCA6OrqZLuO6B4ZO3QDDK5JrGCZ9z_hf0EpAthNqZw7mrPSKcY)


            [dYdX](https://www.kucoin.com/price/DYDX) is a decentralized exchange
            platform that leverages blockchain technology to offer advanced financial
            services, such as perpetual trading, without intermediaries. Built on
            Ethereum and transitioning to its [Layer 2](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/crypto/best-layer-2-networks-to-watch)
            protocol powered by StarkWare, dYdX enables users to engage in high-leverage
            trading with significantly reduced transaction costs and improved transaction
            speeds. dYdX uses Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), specifically a type known
            as zk-STARKs, to enhance the privacy and scalability of its trading platform.
            This technology allows dYdX to execute and verify trades on its decentralized
            platform without revealing any sensitive data about the transactions themselves.
            Using zk-STARKs is particularly advantageous because it offers high scalability
            and security without needing a trusted setup, which is required by another
            common type of ZKP known as zk-SNARKs.


            Recent developments in dYdX have seen the launch of version 4.0 (v4.0)
            of their platform, which includes the dYdX Chain—an open-source blockchain
            utilizing the [Cosmos](https://www.kucoin.com/price/ATOM) SDK for scalability
            and the CometBFT consensus protocol for security. This upgrade introduces
            features such as reduce-only orders and subaccount withdrawal gating to
            enhance trading [risk management](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/trading/mastering-risk-management-in-crypto-trading)
            and governance capabilities. However, the platform''s cutting-edge approach
            and reliance on complex technologies could pose challenges for less tech-savvy
            users. Additionally, while dYdX provides powerful tools for traders, the
            decentralized nature requires users to maintain self-custody of their
            funds, adding a layer of responsibility that may not suit all investors​.

            ### Loopring (LRC)


            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/_S9G2f49EaoRWqvIb3k4Sse47CLQBVSA5L_MA5UVhqnuNI9HXX1IfK1BwTg5-DM0G4C3LoExQSBUep0oxOjQfNVPXHv-YXIUOWHOHZDElRnBv-tzvSJyZF3Uw8e2q6hi2oe95Rvi4pebJVLlnKURB4c)


            [Loopring](https://www.kucoin.com/price/LRC) (LRC) is an advanced blockchain
            protocol based on Ethereum, which leverages Zero-Knowledge Rollups (zkRollups)
            to enhance the scalability and efficiency of decentralized exchanges (DEXs)
            and payment platforms. At its core, Loopring allows for the aggregation
            of hundreds of transactions into a single one, significantly reducing
            the gas costs and processing times associated with Ethereum transactions.
            The Loopring protocol achieves this by handling transactions off-chain
            and then settling them on-chain using zkRollups, which provides proof
            that transactions were executed correctly without revealing the transaction
            data itself. This method ensures both speed and security, allowing Loopring
            to process over 2,000 transactions per second​.


            The Loopring protocol also introduces a unique component called "ring
            miners," who match, verify, and settle trading orders. Miners are compensated
            for their services with fees in LRC or a split of the trading margins,
            creating an incentive for efficient order processing. Loopring''s architecture
            supports both automated market maker ( [AMM](https://www.kucoin.com/blog/what-are-automated-market-makers))
            models and traditional order book exchanges, making it versatile for various
            [trading strategies](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/trading). Despite its
            advantages, such as lower transaction costs and higher throughput, Loopring''s
            reliance on more complex technologies like zkRollups could pose a barrier
            to widespread adoption due to the technical knowledge required to implement

            [Zcash](https://www.kucoin.com/price/ZEC) (ZEC) is a cryptocurrency focused
            on enhancing privacy for its users, leveraging advanced cryptographic
            techniques known as zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive
            Arguments of Knowledge) to enable secure, private transactions. Unlike
            traditional cryptocurrencies that offer pseudonymity, Zcash provides the
            option of "shielded" transactions, which keep the sender, receiver, and
            transaction amount private. Launched in 2016 as a fork of [Bitcoin](https://www.kucoin.com/price/BTC),
            Zcash aims to combine the financial privacy that cash transactions offer
            with the global digital utility of cryptocurrency​.


            Zcash has undergone significant developments since its inception, including
            multiple network upgrades such as Sprout, Overwinter, Sapling, and, more
            recently, Heartwood and Canopy. These updates have continuously improved

            ### Worldcoin (WLD)


            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/SCmyQsXOcb7UBznBiSo_sKsfmqkfMy2db-xvwTMRtdgBI9SSN6vwm4TDKThvqQ5LutRJPpFeULqa3V3wAbEe8znh5dvF2d-YDGzM2T5BN3cDYk8cFcEktrg3jNZ1YbsRN0BBRmkazG2jVwMGjKKdQUg)


            [Worldcoin](https://www.kucoin.com/price/WLD) (WLD) is a cryptocurrency
            project that combines digital identity verification with blockchain technology
            to provide a unique solution to global economic inclusion. The project,
            co-founded by Sam Altman, utilizes a device called an "Orb" to scan individuals''
            irises to create a secure, blockchain-based digital identity known as
            World ID. This identity is used to issue Worldcoin tokens (WLD) to individuals,
            promoting a decentralized and inclusive global economy.


            Worldcoin utilizes zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) to enhance privacy andsecurity
            within its World ID system. Worldcoin employs ZKPs to confirm a user''s
            unique identity and humanity without disclosing any personal information.
            This allows for privacy-preserving interactions within the digital economy.
            Specifically, Worldcoin integrates a protocol called Semaphore, which
            uses ZKPs to enable users to prove membership in a group without revealing
            their identity. This is crucial for activities like voting or endorsements
            within the Worldcoin ecosystem, where privacy and anonymity are paramount.
            Implementing ZKPs ensures that activities carried out with a World ID
            cannot be linked to a person’s biometrics or other identity markers, safeguarding
            user privacy across different applications​.


            The project, however, has faced scrutiny and controversy, particularly
            regarding privacy and data security. The collection of biometric data
            through iris scanning has raised concerns about how this data is managed
            and protected. Additionally, the centralization of control over the project''s
            smart contracts has been viewed as contradictory to its decentralized
            ethos. Regulatory challenges also loom as different countries examine
            the legality and security of such biometric data collection. Despite these
            challenges, Worldcoin continues to expand to foster a more accessible
            and equitable digital economy. The initiative''s future success will depend
            significantly on its ability to address these privacy concerns and navigate
            regulatory environments effectively.

            ### Marlin (POND)


            ![](https://lh7-us.googleusercontent.com/ILpSD600xjehdORcEhh-0ps0ZWTU8AWjdB0XCv4p21lbmhc8FO9VWjyKqt6Dqm73RaUudxVhjeK2nKqUXIzGW9HnEQxubBu0GrdDsU4BXx4vNt-SFc1sZNwGLFTO3L9_G2xEkVXdm65dIbTKCB3KFuE)


            [Marlin](https://www.kucoin.com/price/POND) (POND) is a decentralized
            protocol designed to optimize the execution of complex algorithms and
            computations off-chain while maintaining the integrity and security typical
            of [on-chain](https://www.kucoin.com/learn/glossary/on-chain) processes.
            The core of Marlin''s architecture involves the use of coprocessors across
            a distributed network of nodes that enable high-speed data processing
            with access to both blockchain history and Web 2.0 APIs. This setup allows
            for the offloading of intensive computational tasks from the blockchain,
            reducing costs and speeding up execution time. The verification of these
            off-chain computations is ensured by combining Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)
            and Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs), which provide compact, secure
            verifications of computational correctness that can be easily validated
            on-chain​.


            Marlin has been developed to support a variety of programming environments
            and can execute programs written in languages like Solidity, C++, Rust,
            and Go. This flexibility is complemented by its scalable architecture,
            which includes different types of nodes, such as gateway, execution, and
            monitoring nodes, each serving a unique function within the network. Gateway
            nodes act as load balancers, execution nodes handle the actual computations,
            and monitoring nodes ensure the network''s reliability and performance.
            The Marlin ecosystem is powered by the POND token, which is used to provide
            security guarantees for the network. Nodes are required to stake POND
            tokens to participate, and they risk these stakes if they fail to adhere
            to the network''s operational standards. This staking mechanism incentivizes
            proper behavior and adherence to protocol rules.

            \n## Introduction\n\nFrom finance to communications to commerce, the most\
            \ essential things in our lives are increasingly digital, and at a pace\
            \ that only continues to accelerate. This has fostered unprecedented economic\
            \ growth and technological innovations, however our most sensitive and\
            \ private information has necessarily come along for the ride. This puts\
            \ individuals, private organizations, and governments increasingly at\
            \ risk of becoming victims of data breaches and hacks.\n\nSolutions to\
            \ these problems often call for increased know your customer practices\
            \ (KYC) and reporting. KYC is a regulatory and security process where\
            \ businesses verify the identity of their clients to prevent identity\
            \ theft, financial fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing. While\
            \ there are benefits to this approach, it comes with the risk of sensitive\
            \ data being distributed to even more parties, thus increasing the potential\
            \ surface area for attack, and further reducing individual privacy. In\
            \ a world where trust in institutions is historically low, this can be\
            \ a hard pill for individuals to swallow. But what if there was a solution\
            \ that allowed individuals, private organizations, and governments alike\
            \ to verify things like identity and financial data with said data always\
            \ remaining encrypted and obfuscated? What if you didn’t have to trust\
            \ because instead, you could verify?\n\nZero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have\
            \ emerged as a pivotal cryptographic innovation representing a paradigm\
            \ shift replacing the need to trust with the ability to _verify_. This\
            \ comprehensive exploration will shed light on how ZKPs are reshaping\
            \ privacy and security paradigms across various sectors. By the end of\
            \ this article, policymakers will have gained a nuanced understanding\
            \ of ZKPs' potential to improve security while maintaining privacy across\
            \ a wide range of use cases and why they are indispensable in today’s\
            \ digital ecosystem.\n\n## An Idea Ahead of Its Time\n\nFirst described\
            \ in a [1985 MIT paper](https://people.csail.mit.edu/silvio/Selected%20Scientific%20Papers/Proof%20Systems/The_Knowledge_Complexity_Of_Interactive_Proof_Systems.pdf),\
            \ zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have been an idea simmering on the back\
            \ burner of cryptographic research for decades. Although conceptually\
            \ sound, the technology required for large-scale and cost-effective deployment\
            \ was not yet available. However, with recent advancements in computational\
            \ power and the advent of blockchain technology, ZKPs are now coming to\
            \ the forefront.\n\nThe feasibility of ZKP applications now being able\
            \ to be deployed at scale can be attributed primarily to two key developments:\n\
            \n1. **Advancements in Computational Power:** Historically, ZKPs were\
            \ computationally intensive, requiring significant processing power which\
            \ limited their practicality. The exponential growth in computational\
            \ capabilities, in particular, more efficient processors and the widespread\
            \ availability of cloud computing, has made it feasible to perform complex\
            \ ZKP computations quickly and cost-effectively.\n\n2. **Synergies with\
            \ Blockchain Technology:** The cryptographic nature of ZKPs aligns seamlessly\
            \ with blockchain technologies. Blockchain's inherent characteristics\
            \ of decentralization, immutability, and transparency provide a conducive\
            \ environment for ZKP applications. Several blockchain platforms have\
            \ integrated ZKPs as a core component of their technology stack, fostering\
            \ ready-built platforms for the development and deployment of ZKP-based\
            \ applications.\n\n\nThese technological advancements have transformed\
            \ ZKPs from a theoretical concept into a practical tool, unlocking their\
            \ potential to enhance privacy and security in an increasingly digital\
            \ world.\n\n## How Do Zero-Knowledge Proofs Work?\n\nIn a zero-knowledge\
            \ proof, there are two parties: a prover and a verifier. In this transaction,\
            \ the prover can assure a verifier of the truthfulness of a particular\
            \ assertion regarding a data point without revealing any extra details\
            \ about the corresponding data.\n\nZKPs can be categorized into two types:\n\
            \n- **Interactive**, where the prover must engage in the verification\
            \ process anew for each distinct verifier.\n\n- **Non-interactiv** e,\
            \ where the prover creates a universally verifiable proof.\n\n\nThe three\
            \ key characteristics that encapsulate a ZKP are:\n\n- **Completeness**:\
            \ For any true statement, a credible prover can successfully persuade\
            \ an honest verifier of their knowledge about the accurate input.\n\n\
            - **Soundness:** In the case of a false statement, no deceitful prover\
            \ can independently convince an honest verifier of their knowledge about\
            \ the accurate input.\n\n- **Zero-Knowledge**: When the statement is true,\
            \ the verifier gains no additional information from the prover beyond\
            \ the fact that the statement is indeed true.\n\n\nThe math that makes\
            \ this possible is beyond the scope of this piece, however, a simple example\
            \ can help conceptualize how a ZKP works.\n\nImagine you have a \"Where's\
            \ Waldo?\" book, and you claim to know exactly where Waldo is on a particular\
            \ page. Your friend, however, is skeptical and wants proof of your claim.\
            \ But here's the challenge: you need to prove you know where Waldo is\
            \ without pointing him out directly, thus keeping his location a secret.\n\
            \n![A photo in sepia of a crowd with a man wearing glasses and a red and\
            \ white stripped sweater and had in color. ](https://5g.wilsoncenter.org/sites/default/files/styles/fullbleed_image/public/media/uploads/images/8560929002_bd81ba6679_o.jpg)\n\
            \nImage Credit\n\nWhere's Waldo? byBarbara Friedman\n\n[https://www.flickr.com/photos/btf5/8560929002/in/photolist-e3uZWb-2njZwsF-2n8Dk9e-Cbkd28-2n8yfHm-4nFLBz-2n8Dk9u-2jDsCuZ-Masdhh-81uW91-FgJx5U-ZGrxHA-BTMey-2n1CRfi-2nj6p3n-2nj7FQu-8EUaoj-2niYPhG-2nj5bAN-2nj5avb-2nj7Gk2-2iFCpo8-2nj6oyr-hiqBnv-2niYNej-2nj5kie-2nj5b9L-2nj7F9e-2nj59gY-2nj59Sh-2nj5kVB-2niYN7a-2nj6noa-2nj7EwH-9Zj7wT-9Ckm8q-4DdCfU-deaSce-23ViBAN-PUW8UA-2niYNTR-2eJqgA5-dCixw7-mBSP44-4D9nJk-2nj6nA4-qqtWBz-4D9mWF-5ApDf5-jFMTTg](https://www.flickr.com/photos/btf5/8560929002/in/photolist-e3uZWb-2njZwsF-2n8Dk9e-Cbkd28-2n8yfHm-4nFLBz-2n8Dk9u-2jDsCuZ-Masdhh-81uW91-FgJx5U-ZGrxHA-BTMey-2n1CRfi-2nj6p3n-2nj7FQu-8EUaoj-2niYPhG-2nj5bAN-2nj5avb-2nj7Gk2-2iFCpo8-2nj6oyr-hiqBnv-2niYNej-2nj5kie-2nj5b9L-2nj7F9e-2nj59gY-2nj59Sh-2nj5kVB-2niYN7a-2nj6noa-2nj7EwH-9Zj7wT-9Ckm8q-4DdCfU-deaSce-23ViBAN-PUW8UA-2niYNTR-2eJqgA5-dCixw7-mBSP44-4D9nJk-2nj6nA4-qqtWBz-4D9mWF-5ApDf5-jFMTTg)\n\
            \nHere's how you can do it: \"Where's Waldo?\"\n\n1. **The Challenge:**\
            \ You open the \"Where's Waldo?\" book to the page in question and show\
            \ it to your friend.\n\n2. **The Proof Technique:** To prove your knowledge\
            \ without revealing Waldo's location, you take a large piece of cardboard\
            \ with a small hole cut in it.\n\n3. **The Verification:** You place the\
            \ cardboard over the page so that the hole reveals Waldo, but nothing\
            \ else on the page is visible. Your friend can now see Waldo through the\
            \ hole, confirming you know his location.\n\n4. **Maintaining Secrecy:**\
            \ Despite verifying your claim, your friend still doesn't know where on\
            \ the page Waldo is. The rest of the page is covered, keeping the information\
            \ hidden.\n\n\nIn this scenario:\n\n- **Completeness:** If you truly know\
            \ where Waldo is, you can easily align the hole in the cardboard to reveal\
            \ him, convincing your friend of your knowledge.\n\n- **Soundness:** If\
            \ you don’t actually know where Waldo is, you won’t be able to align the\
            \ hole correctly, and your friend won’t be convinced of your claim.\n\n\
            - **Zero-Knowledge:** Despite proving you know Waldo’s location, you haven’t\
            \ revealed any additional information about where on the page Waldo is.\n\
            \n\nThese proofs enable one party to prove the validity of a statement\
            \ to another without revealing any underlying information. In an era where\
            \ data breaches are rampant, ZKPs offer hope for secure and private online\
            \ interactions.\n\n## A Myriad of Real-World and Digital-World Applications\n\
            \nZKPs have a wide array of applications, each demonstrating their versatility\
            \ and importance in enhancing privacy and security in various digital\
            \ domains:\n\n### Decentralized Identity and Authentication:\n\nZKPs can\
            \ serve as a foundational technology for identity management systems by\
            \ offering a dual advantage: they enable robust identity verification\
            \ while safeguarding personal information. This is particularly relevant\
            \ in systems built on blockchains, which are inherently global and interoperable,\
            \ facilitating secure international information sharing.\n\n- **Offline\
            \ Applications:** ZKPs can be used in everyday situations like confirming\
            \ age for alcohol purchase or even verifying citizenship and non-sanctioned\
            \ status at international borders. In these cases, ZKPs provide proof\
            \ of specific personal attributes without revealing any additional personal\
            \ information.\n\n- **Online Applications:** The decentralized nature\
            \ of blockchain networks limits traditional KYC practices, but ZKPs offer\
            \ a way for central entities to securely verify user identities.\n\n\n\
            Since it is one of the most impactful applications of ZKPs, the following\
            \ section takes a deep dive into decentralized identity.\n\n### Voting\
            \ Systems:\n\nZKPs introduce a new paradigm in voting systems, particularly\
            \ in conjunction with distributed ledger technologies. Together, they\
            \ enable a voting process that is both anonymous and verifiable, enhancing\
            \ the integrity and transparency of elections.\n\n- **Identity Verification\
            \ and Eligibility Checks:** Leveraging the decentralized identity solutions\
            \ discussed earlier, ZKPs can be used to verify a voter's identity and\
            \ their eligibility to vote. This approach ensures that only qualified\
            \ individuals participate in the voting process and that no one can vote\
            \ more than once. Such identity verification acts as a gatekeeper to access\
            \ existing voting systems, upholding the principle that every vote counts\
            \ and should be counted correctly.\n\n- **Anonymous Verifiable Voting:**\
            \ Beyond verifying voter identity, ZKPs can preserve the anonymity of\
            \ the voting process. Voters can confidently validate their eligibility\
            \ and cast their ballots without having to reveal their identities or\
            \ the specifics of their vote. This application of ZKPs allows each vote\
            \ to remain confidential while ensuring the entire voting process is transparent\
            \ and auditable.\n\n- **Auditable Yet Private Voting System:** The integration\
            \ of ZKPs in voting systems is transformative, enhancing both the verification\
            \ mechanism and the voting process itself. By incorporating ZKPs, the\
            \ system not only links each vote to an eligible voter but also maintains\
            \ voter anonymity. This dual capability creates a voting environment that\
            \ is secure, transparent, and respectful of voter privacy. The system\
            \ can be implemented either as an identity check before accessing existing\
            \ voting platforms or as an integral part of a new blockchain-based voting\
            \ system, embedding both identity verification and vote casting within\
            \ a unified, secure framework.\n\n\n### AI and Machine Learning:\n\n-\
            \ Privacy Preservation in Data Usage:\n  - A key challenge in AI and machine\
            \ learning is accessing large datasets for training models without compromising\
            \ sensitive information contained within the data. ZKPs enable the verification\
            \ of data authenticity and integrity for these models while keeping the\
            \ underlying data elements private.\n\n  - The capability to verify information\
            \ while maintain privacy is particularly crucial in industries like healthcare\
            \ or finance, where data confidentiality is paramount. ZKPs allow for\
            \ the utilization of detailed datasets for model training without exposing\
            \ individual data points, thus upholding privacy standards and regulatory\
            \ compliance.\n- Blockchain Integration for Model Accountability:\n  -\
            \ Combining ZKPs with blockchain technology introduces a new level of\
            \ transparency and accountability in AI and machine learning. Blockchain\
            \ provides an immutable record of transactions which enables the tracking\
            \ of data changes, model updates, and decision-making processes when applied\
            \ to AI models.\n\n  - This integration allows for a transparent audit\
            \ trail of how AI models evolve over time and how data influences these\
            \ models. It addresses concerns around model integrity and reliability,\
            \ ensuring that changes or updates to AI systems are transparent and accountable.\n\
            - Enhancing Trust in AI Systems:\n  - By utilizing ZKPs, AI and machine\
            \ learning systems can demonstrate that they function as intended without\
            \ revealing their internal workings or the proprietary data they process.\
            \ This builds trust among users and stakeholders, assuring them that the\
            \ AI systems are not only effective but also respect privacy and data\
            \ security.\n\n  - In scenarios where decisions made by AI systems need\
            \ to be justified or explained, such as in credit scoring or medical diagnostics,\
            \ the combination of ZKPs and blockchain can provide necessary assurances\
            \ about the data and processes used without compromising sensitive information.\n\
            - Facilitating Collaborative AI Development:\n  - ZKPs enable multiple\
            \ parties to contribute data to AI models securely and privately. This\
            \ collaborative approach, bolstered by the trust mechanisms of ZKPs and\
            \ blockchain, can accelerate AI innovation by allowing diverse data sources\
            \ to be used collectively, broadening the scope and applicability of AI\
            \ solutions.\n\n### Privacy on Public Blockchains:\n\n- The immutable\
            \ and public nature of data stored on a blockchain is a defining and often\
            \ beneficial feature, this feature can become an issue in transactions\
            \ that require privacy. For more on the challenges and opportunities presented\
            \ by the transparent nature of public blockchains, check out our previous\
            \ [Blockchain Brief on blockchain privacy.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/blockchain-worlds-least-private-diary)\n\
            \  - **Private Transactions:** ZKPs are used in blockchains for privacy-preserving\
            \ transactions that keep details like monetary amounts and participant\
            \ identities private.  ZKPs can keep this information private while verifying\
            \ that users are not participating in illicit activity or transacting\
            \ with sanctioned entities.\n\n  - **Private Exchange and Settlement of\
            \ Digital Assets:** ZKPs ensure the privacy of transactions and participants\
            \ during the exchange of digital tokens, such as equity tokens. This is\
            \ crucial for both centralized and decentralized exchanges, allowing for\
            \ efficient and private asset settlement. As more real-world assets (RWAs)\
            \ like real estate and high-valuable collectibles are tokenized and more\
            \ transactions involving RWAs are conducted on-chain, this efficiency\
            \ and privacy is paramount.\n\n### Scalable Ethereum Layer 2 Rollups:\n\
            \nZKPs, through methods like zero-knowledge rollups (ZK-rollups), are\
            \ highly secure and scalable Layer 2 solutions on Ethereum that facilitate\
            \ faster, more efficient transactions. If you need a refresher on the\
            \ difference between a Layer 1 and Layer 2 blockchain before we dive deeper\
            \ into the current state of ZK rollups, be sure to check out our previous\
            \ [Blockchain Brief where we break it down.](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks)\n\
            \n### Oracle-Enhanced Verifiable Computations:\n\n- In decentralized oracle\
            \ networks, ZKPs can be leveraged for verifiable computations related\
            \ to off-chain data points. [As explained in a previous Blockchain Brief](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/delphi-defi-how-crypto-oracles-are-shaping-future-finance),\
            \ blockchain oracles provide smart contracts with access to external data\
            \ and computation results. Using ZKPs in this context ensures the integrity\
            \ and confidentiality of the data processed by the oracles. Relevant off-chain\
            \ data points include:Financial Data: Verifying stock prices or foreign\
            \ exchange rates for use in smart contracts without revealing sensitive\
            \ market data.\n\n- Supply Chain Information: Confirming the authenticity\
            \ of supply chain events like product manufacturing or shipping status\
            \ without disclosing proprietary details.\n\n- Real-World Events: Maintaining\
            \ data privacy while validating outcomes of real-world events, like sports\
            \ results and election outcomes, that impact contract executions Weather\
            \ Data: Securely integrating weather information for agriculture-related\
            \ smart contracts without full data exposure.\n\n\n### Internet of Things\
            \ (IoT):\n\n- Securing IoT device communications and reducing data transmission\
            \ through ZKPs enhances both privacy and efficiency in interconnected\
            \ devices.\n\n\n### Supply Chains:\n\n- ZKPs can authenticate compliance\
            \ and origin in supply chain management without revealing sensitive data,\
            \ which is crucial for businesses that wish to keep supplier information\
            \ confidential.\n\n\nThese diverse applications across sectors underscores\
            \ the significance of ZKPs in addressing privacy and security challenges\
            \ in the digital age by offering robust solutions for secure, private,\
            \ and efficient digital interactions.\n\n## A Deeper Dive into Decentralized\
            \ Digital Identity and Securing Personal Identifiable Information\n\n\
            Zero-knowledge proofs present a unique solution to address the urgent\
            \ need for safe and secure methods of digital identity verification and\
            \ storage of personal identifiable information (PII). ZPKs minimize the\
            \ exposure of PII by enabling the verification of essential information\
            \ while keeping other personal details hidden, thereby fortifying systems\
            \ against data breaches and preserving individual privacy. This is crucial\
            \ in scenarios ranging from social media interactions to financial transactions.\n\
            \nConsider the routine action of showing an ID to purchase alcohol – you\
            \ inadvertently expose more information than necessary.\n\nThe cashier\
            \ only needs to verify two things: that the id is a valid, government\
            \ issued id and that you are 21 or older. Yet you are revealing your full\
            \ name, home address, birthdate and age, sex, height, weight, eye color,\
            \ and driver’s license number. These pieces of information are individually\
            \ harmless, but when they are used together, there is potential for abuse,\
            \ not to mention a violation of an individual’s right to privacy.\n\n\
            This scenario is amplified online, where the sharing of social security\
            \ numbers, financial details, and personal activities often leads to privacy\
            \ invasion and increases the risk of cyberattacks. Consider the following\
            \ three examples representing massive misuse and exposure of sensitive\
            \ user data, and how Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) could have potentially\
            \ mitigated these incidents:\n\n1\\. Cambridge Analytica Scandal:\n\n\
            - **Real-World Incident:** A third-party app, This Is Your Digital Life,\
            \ allowed unauthorized collection of personal data from millions of Facebook\
            \ users. Cambridge Analytica used that data for political advertising,\
            \ including in the 2016 U.S. presidential election campaign. This breach\
            \ raised significant concerns about privacy and the influence of social\
            \ media on politics.\n\n- **ZKP Mitigation:** ZKPs could have been used\
            \ to verify the specific user attributes (e.g., age, location, political\
            \ interests) necessary for academic research or targeted advertising without\
            \ revealing or transferring the underlying data. That way, Facebook could\
            \ confirm specific demographics of its user base to third parties without\
            \ exposing individual user data.\n\n\n2\\.  T-Mobile Data Breaches:\n\n\
            - **Real-World Incident:** Caused by a misconfigured API, T-Mobile experienced\
            \ a data breach that exposed the personal data of 37 million customers.\
            \ The stolen data was used by cybercriminals for sophisticated phishing,\
            \ vishing, and smishing attacks.\n\n- **ZKP Mitigation:** ZKPs could have\
            \ been employed in T-Mobile’s data handling processes to validate user\
            \ identity and credentials without exposing user data. For instance, a\
            \ customer service application could verify that a person is a T-Mobile\
            \ customer and check their plan details without the API accessing the\
            \ full range of personal information stored in the database.\n\n\n3\\\
            . Equifax Data Breach of 2017:\n\n- **Real-World Incident:** This breach,\
            \ one of the largest in U.S. history, compromised the personal information\
            \ of about 147.9 million Americans, as well as millions of British and\
            \ Canadian citizens. Hackers accessed names, Social Security numbers,\
            \ birth dates, addresses, and in some cases, driver's license numbers.\
            \ The breach was deemed \"entirely preventable\" by the House Committee\
            \ on Oversight.\n\n- **ZKP Mitigation:** If ZKPs had been used, Equifax\
            \ could have allowed third-party services to confirm individuals' creditworthiness\
            \ or identity without accessing detailed personal data like Social Security\
            \ numbers or birth dates. For example, a lender could verify if a person's\
            \ credit score falls within a specific range without Equifax needing to\
            \ share the actual credit report.\n\n\nIn each of these scenarios, ZKPs\
            \ would have offered a way to validate and prove necessary information\
            \ without exposing data, thus significantly reducing the risk of data\
            \ breaches and misuse of personal information. Implementing ZKPs requires\
            \ rethinking how systems interact with personal data and moving towards\
            \ a model where verification is possible without data exposure. The adoption\
            \ of ZKPs benefits individuals whose personal data remains protected and\
            \ private as well as businesses, which can avoid the substantial financial\
            \ and reputational damage often associated with such data breaches. By\
            \ enhancing data security and integrity, ZKPs provide two key benefits:\
            \ they help in building trust among consumers and simultaneously safeguard\
            \ businesses against the risks and liabilities of data mismanagement.\n\
            \n## The Current State of ZK-Rollups\n\nAs noted earlier, the two developments\
            \ that have allowed ZKPs to finally transition from academic concept to\
            \ real world use have been increased power and availability of compute\
            \ and blockchains. While smart contract platforms like Solana and Avalanche\
            \ have seen significant growth in daily active users, ecosystem development,\
            \ and capital inflows in 2023, Ethereum and its Layer 2 blockchains remain\
            \ the dominant smart contract ecosystem. As of 1/17/24, Ethereum and its\
            \ L2 chains have a combined market cap ($322B) 1.6X higher than [every\
            \ other smart contract platform combined](https://www.coingecko.com/en/categories/smart-contract-platform)\
            \ and 72% ($78B) of [total value locked](https://defillama.com/chains)\
            \ (TVL) in [decentralized finance (DeFi)](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/defi-101-good-bad-and-regulatory).\n\
            \nAs discussed in our previous article, breaking down the difference between\
            \ [L1 and L2 Ethereum](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks),\
            \ L2 blockchains are pivotal in enabling Ethereum to scale. As a quick\
            \ refresher, there are two types of rollups: Optimistic rollups and ZK\
            \ rollups. While ZK rollups are broadly considered the superior technology,\
            \ the increased complexity of ZKP development, higher compute requirements,\
            \ and layer 1 technological limitations have given optimistic rollups\
            \ a strong first mover advantage. The top three optimistic rollups, [Arbitrum](https://arbitrum.foundation/),\
            \ [Optimism](https://www.optimism.io/), and [Base](https://www.base.org/),\
            \ currently hold 81% of the total L2 market share.\n\nThe tide has begun\
            \ to change, as several notable ZK-rollups went live in 2023. As of 2024,\
            \ the development and implementation of ZK-rollups on Ethereum have advanced\
            \ significantly, showing promising growth and innovation in various projects.\n\
            \nYou can find a list of notable Optimistic and ZK-rollups in the previous\
            \ Blockchain Brief, [Understanding Ethereum's Layer 1 and Layer 2](https://www.wilsoncenter.org/article/understanding-ethereums-layer-1-and-layer-2-differences-adoption-and-drawbacks).\n\
            \nWhile optimistic rollups collectively represent the majority of L2 activity\
            \ and TVL, ZK-rollups are quickly picking up steam and are expected to\
            \ overtake their optimistic cousins. Notably, over the last 30 days, [zkSync\
            \ Era](https://zksync.io/) has processed more transactions than Arbitrum,\
            \ Optimism, Base, and Ethereum Mainnet. Both Arbitrum and Optimism have\
            \ both stated they expect to transition their respective chains to ZK-rollups\
            \ eventually.\n\nThe key takeaway here is that the myriad of real-world\
            \ use cases enabled by ZKPs requires a compatible blockchain. That compatibility\
            \ now exists with the advent of ZK-rollups. This, in conjunction with\
            \ the upcoming [Dencun upgrade](https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2023/10/27/ethereums-dencun-upgrade-is-a-step-toward-a-scalable-settlement-layer-goldman-sachs/)\
            \ to Ethereum set to launch in the coming months (currently live on testnet\
            \ as of 1/17/24), which will dramatically decrease transaction costs for\
            \ L2s while bringing enhanced security, will not only allow all of these\
            \ use cases to deploy but also allow them to do so cost-effectively at\
            \ scale.\n\n## Why Policymakers Should Pay Attention\n\nWe live in an\
            \ increasingly digital world. As individuals, private organizations, and\
            \ governments move more of their interactions online, ever more of our\
            \ most sensitive data is put at risk of data breaches and hacks. At a\
            \ time when faith in public institutions is at an [all time low](https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2023/09/19/public-trust-in-government-1958-2023/)\
            \ and global ransomware attacks are predicted to [exceed $265B by 2031](https://cybersecurityventures.com/global-ransomware-damage-costs-predicted-to-reach-250-billion-usd-by-2031/),\
            \ the need for technologies like ZKPs to restore faith in the integrity\
            \ of elections, bolster online security, and protect an individual's right\
            \ to privacy is abundantly clear.\n\nThere are many applications of ZKPs\
            \ that can help balance privacy, security, and regulatory compliance.\
            \ This is especially relevant in the context of global and interoperable\
            \ blockchain technology, where ZKPs can bolster blockchains ability to\
            \ enhance the resilience and accessibility of critical infrastructure\
            \ and international cooperation.\n\n### Challenges in the US Regulatory\
            \ Environment\n\nThe US’s ambiguous regulatory environment is currently\
            \ driving blockchain and ZKP-based technology development overseas. A\
            \ lack of clear guidelines is causing a brain drain in this sector, with\
            \ developers and companies opting for more predictable and supportive\
            \ environments in countries like Japan, Singapore, and parts of the EU.\
            \ This regulatory uncertainty is particularly impactful in the area of\
            \ decentralized finance (DeFi), where traditional frameworks struggle\
            \ to adapt to the novel nature of blockchain technologies.\n\n### ZKPs:\
            \ A Potential Solution to DeFi KYC\n\nWithin this challenging regulatory\
            \ landscape, the proposed digital assets tax reporting regulations in\
            \ the bipartisan infrastructure bill have defined decentralized entities\
            \ as brokers. This definition is incompatible with the decentralized nature\
            \ of these entities' protocols, as many lack a central entity capable\
            \ of conducting traditional Know Your Customer (KYC) practices. The significant\
            \ compliance and cost burden for startups could drive talent offshore,\
            \ potentially cutting off US users from innovative products. Furthermore,\
            \ the decentralized structure of these platforms allows users bypass front-end\
            \ data collection and access the backend directly.\n\nZero-Knowledge Proofs\
            \ (ZKPs) emerge as a feasible solution in this context. They enable the\
            \ verification of essential information and reporting through smart contracts,\
            \ all without the need to store sensitive data. By using ZKPs, compliance\
            \ with regulations can be achieved while maintaining a balance between\
            \ privacy, security, and innovation. This technology not only minimizes\
            \ the risk of spreading sensitive data across multiple parties but also\
            \ alleviates the compliance burden for emerging companies. In turn, this\
            \ fosters a healthier environment for technological advancement in the\
            \ US, particularly in the burgeoning field of DeFi.\n\n## Conclusion:\
            \ A Call to Action for Policymakers\n\nAs we navigate the complexities\
            \ of the digital age, Zero-Knowledge Proofs emerge as a powerful tool\
            \ in preserving privacy while ensuring security. Policymakers face the\
            \ challenge of fostering an environment that supports the growth and application\
            \ of ZKPs while protecting consumer rights and privacy. Regulations should\
            \ be forward-thinking, adaptable, and balanced to encourage innovation\
            \ in this space. The harmonious blend of privacy and security that ZKPs\
            \ provide is not just a technological advancement but a step towards a\
            \ more secure and equitable digital world.\n\nIn conclusion, the potential\
            \ of ZKPs is vast and multifaceted. From securing online transactions\
            \ to safeguarding AI and machine learning models, they offer a solution\
            \ that strikes a balance between privacy and security. As machine learning\
            \ continues to evolve and our digital footprints expand, the role of ZKPs\
            \ in protecting our digital identities is critical. It is imperative for\
            \ policymakers to understand these dynamics and create a regulatory environment\
            \ that nurtures innovation, protects consumers, and maintains the integrity\
            \ of the financial system. By embracing the possibilities of Zero-Knowledge\
            \ Proofs, we can pave the way for a more secure, private, and equitable\
            \ digital future.\n\n- [Science and Technology](https://5g.wilsoncenter.org/issue/science-and-technology)\n\

            ## What are Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)?


            Imagine you have a secret and want to prove to someone that you know it
            without revealing it. Zero-knowledge proofs allow just that: proving something
            is true without sharing the details. For example, you could attend a football
            game without revealing your membership card''s personal details or verify
            you have sufficient funds without disclosing your exact bank balance.
            ZKPs enable privacy while providing proof of validity.


            Technically, ZKPs are cryptographic tools that allow verification of information''s
            truthfulness without revealing the information itself. This is incredibly
            useful in blockchain networks, where extensive information is typically
            shared to confirm transactions. With ZKPs, that information can remain
            private.


            Blockchain is evolving from traceability and full transparency to privacy
            with proof of truth. The key distinction is \*proof of validity\*. This
            marks a revolution in blockchain''s original concept and operating model—what
            some call Blockchain 2.0.


            This technological enhancement impacts the following:


            Scalability in Blockchain: ZKP technology improves speed and reduces costs.
            Instead of processing each transaction individually, multiple transactions
            are grouped and verified simultaneously. This is achieved through zero-knowledge
            rollups, enabling efficient off-chain verifications, with only compact
            results updating the main chain. This reduces congestion and transaction
            costs.


            Security in Supply Chains: Companies in sectors like logistics need to
            ensure product authenticity and quality without revealing sensitive information.
            ZKPs allow verification of critical supply chain data, such as a product''s
            origin or status, without exposing confidential details. For example,
            a company can prove a food item complies with regulations without sharing
            its entire production process, improving transparency and trust without
            compromising security or revealing proprietary details.


            Biometrics: In biometric security, protecting personal data is paramount.
            ZKP technology allows authentication using biometric data without storing
            the original information. Systems can generate cryptographic keys from
            facial features, enabling identity verification without risking data theft
            or misuse.


            Digital Identity and Verification: In identification systems, verifying
            a digital user''s identity is crucial. ZKPs allow verification that a
            vote is valid without revealing who cast it or their choice, protecting
            voter confidentiality while ensuring integrity. It’s like depositing a
            vote in a transparent ballot box that correctly counts the votes without
            showing how the ballot sheet was marked.


            Digital Finance: ZKPs enable secure and confidential financial transactions
            while reducing costs, crucial in a heavily regulated ecosystem.


            ## Challenges Facing ZKP Technology


            ZKPs faces several challenges hindering widespread adoption: First, generating
            and verifying proofs requires substantial computing power—it''s like your
            computer constantly solving very complex puzzles, which can be slow and
            expensive. Second, many are unaware of the technology and its potential
            benefits—it’s like having a very useful tool hidden in a drawer because
            no one knows what it''s for. Finally, interoperability between different
            blockchains is challenging due to varying specifications and protocols,
            making it difficult to integrate ZKP solutions uniformly.


            ## Future Trends


            ZKP technology is poised to integrate with other emerging technologies:


            Integration with Decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI): Combining
            ZKPs with decentralized Artificial Intelligence (AI) could create privacy-respecting
            intelligent systems. Imagine a health app providing personalized advice
            without accessing your specific medical data—only whether you''re within
            certain ranges or conditions.


            Security Against Quantum Computers: Quantum computers are extremely powerful
            machines that, in the future, could crack many of the security systems
            we use today. ZKPs are being developed to resist potential attacks from
            future quantum computers, ensuring long-term information security. Think
            of it as a super-advanced lock that even the most sophisticated tools
            cannot open. This ensures that your information will remain secure, even
            when technology advances significantly.


            Mobile Devices with Web3 Technology: Mobile phones that use Web3 and ZKP
            technology will enable more private and secure applications. Imagine using
            a banking app on your phone that conducts transactions without sharing
            your personal data. Thanks to ZKP, these apps can operate securely on
            blockchain networks, protecting your information and making it inaccessible
            to unauthorized third parties.


            ## Conclusion


            Zero-Knowledge Proofs are revolutionizing online privacy and security
            – allowing something to be proven without revealing a secret or detailed
            personal information. This is a game changer particularly in regulated
            industries where breaches can result in significant fines and compensation.


            While challenges remain, advancements are making ZKPs more practical.
            This technology promises more secure and private systems for everyone,
            regardless of technical expertise.
