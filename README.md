## Heurist Mesh
![mesh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77a2ab3b-e35c-4313-8a5b-a0e751cac879)

**Heurist Mesh** is an open network where AI agents are contributed by the community and used modularly‚Äîsimilar to DeFi smart contracts. Each agent is a specialized unit that can process data, generate reports, or perform actions while collectively forming an intelligent swarm to tackle complex tasks. Each agent is accessible via a unified REST API interface, and can be used in conjunction with any agent framework or application.

Want to contribute your own agent? Check out the [Mesh README](./mesh/README.md) for detailed guidelines, examples, and best practices.

### MCP Support
**Just In:** All Heurist Mesh agents are accessible via MCP! This means you can access them from your favorite MCP client, including [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download), [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/), and [Windsurf](https://codeium.com/windsurf).

Head to [heurist-mesh-mcp-server](https://github.com/heurist-network/heurist-mesh-mcp-server) to set up a server and give your AI assistant a powerup.

### Usage and Development Guide

[Read the Mesh documentation](./mesh/README.md)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heurist-network/heurist-agent-framework.git
cd heurist-agent-framework
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
see `.env.example`


## Usage

### Running Different Interfaces

1. Telegram Agent:
```bash
python main_telegram.py
```

2. Discord Agent:
```bash
python main_discord.py
```

3. REST API:
```bash
python main_api.py
```

4. Twitter Bot (Posting):
```bash
python main_twitter.py
```

### API Endpoints

The REST API provides the following endpoints:

- POST `/message`
  - Request body: `{"message": "Your message here"}`
  - Response: `{"text": "Response text", "image_url": "Optional image URL"}`

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Tell me about artificial intelligence"}'
```

## Architecture

The framework follows a modular design:

1. Core Agent (`core_agent.py`)
   - Handles core functionality
   - Manages LLM interactions
   - Processes images and voice

2. Interfaces
   - Telegram (`interfaces/telegram_agent.py`)
   - Discord (`interfaces/discord_agent.py`)
   - API (`interfaces/flask_agent.py`)
   - Twitter (`interfaces/twitter_agent.py`)
   - Farcaster (`interfaces/farcaster_agent.py`)

Each interface inherits from the CoreAgent and implements platform-specific handling.

### Main Loop

</div>

## Configuration

The framework uses YAML configuration for prompts and agent behavior. Configure these in:
```
config/prompts.yaml
```

## Development

To add a new interface:

1. Create a new class inheriting from `CoreAgent`
2. Implement platform-specific handlers
3. Use core agent methods for processing:
   - `handle_message()`
   - `handle_image_generation()`
   - `transcribe_audio()`

## How to Use GitHub Issues

We encourage the community to open **GitHub issues** whenever you have a new idea or find something that needs attention. When creating an issue, please use our [Issue Template](./.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/general_issue_template.md) and select one of the following categories:

1. **Integration Request**  
   - For requests to integrate with a new data source (e.g., CoinGecko, arXiv) or a new AI use case.  
   - **Most important** for the community, as these issues help drive the direction of our framework's evolution.  
   - If you have an idea but aren't sure how to implement it, open an issue under this label so others can pick it up or offer suggestions.

2. **Bug**  
   - For reporting errors or unexpected behavior in the framework.  
   - Provide as much detail as possible (logs, steps to reproduce, environment, etc.).

3. **Question**  
   - For inquiries about usage, best practices, or clarifications on existing features.

4. **Bounty**  
   - For tasks with a **reward** (e.g., tokens, NFTs, or other benefits).  
   - The bounty label indicates that Heurist team or another community member are offering a reward to whoever resolves the issue.  
   - **Bounty Rules**:

     - Once your Pull Request addressing the bounty is merged, we'll follow up on fulfilling the reward.  
     - Additional instructions (e.g., contact method) may be included in the issue itself.

### Picking Up an Issue

- Look for **Integration Requests** or **Bounty** issues if you want to contribute new features or earn rewards.  
- Feel free to discuss approaches in the comments. If you're ready to tackle it, mention "I'm working on this!" so others know it's in progress.
