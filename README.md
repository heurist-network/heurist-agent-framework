## Overview

The Heurist Agent Framework is built on a modular architecture that allows an AI agent to:
- Process text and voice messages
- Generate images and videos
- Interact across multiple platforms with consistent behavior
- Fetch and store information in a knowledge base (Postgres and SQLite supported)
- Access external APIs, tools, and a wide range of [Mesh Agents](./mesh/README.md) to compose complex workflows

## Features

- ü§ñ Core Agent functionality with LLM integration
- üñºÔ∏è Image generation capabilities
- üé§ Voice processing (transcription and TTS)
- üîå Multiple interface support:
  - Telegram bot
  - Discord bot
  - Twitter automation
  - Farcaster integration
  - REST API

## Heurist Mesh

**Heurist Mesh** is an open network where AI agents can be contributed by the community and used modularly‚Äîsimilar to DeFi smart contracts. Each agent is a specialized unit that can process data, generate reports, or perform actions while collectively forming an intelligent swarm to tackle complex tasks. Each agent is accessible via a unified REST API interface, and can be used in conjunction with any agent framework or application.

Want to contribute your own agent? Check out the [Mesh README](./mesh/README.md) for detailed guidelines, examples, and best practices.

### Usage

[Read the Mesh documentation](./mesh/README.md)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/heurist-network/heurist-agent-framework.git
cd heurist-agent-framework
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up environment variables in `.env`:
see `.env.example`


## Usage

### Running Different Interfaces

1. Telegram Agent:
```bash
python main_telegram.py
```

2. Discord Agent:
```bash
python main_discord.py
```

3. REST API:
```bash
python main_api.py
```

4. Twitter Bot (Posting):
```bash
python main_twitter.py
```

### API Endpoints

The REST API provides the following endpoints:

- POST `/message`
  - Request body: `{"message": "Your message here"}`
  - Response: `{"text": "Response text", "image_url": "Optional image URL"}`

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5005/message \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "Tell me about artificial intelligence"}'
```

## Architecture

The framework follows a modular design:

1. Core Agent (`core_agent.py`)
   - Handles core functionality
   - Manages LLM interactions
   - Processes images and voice

2. Interfaces
   - Telegram (`interfaces/telegram_agent.py`)
   - Discord (`interfaces/discord_agent.py`)
   - API (`interfaces/flask_agent.py`)
   - Twitter (`interfaces/twitter_agent.py`)
   - Farcaster (`interfaces/farcaster_agent.py`)

Each interface inherits from the CoreAgent and implements platform-specific handling.

</div>


## Configuration

The framework uses YAML configuration for prompts and agent behavior. Configure these in:
```
config/prompts.yaml
```

## Development

To add a new interface:

1. Create a new class inheriting from `CoreAgent`
2. Implement platform-specific handlers
3. Use core agent methods for processing:
   - `handle_message()`
   - `handle_image_generation()`
   - `transcribe_audio()`
